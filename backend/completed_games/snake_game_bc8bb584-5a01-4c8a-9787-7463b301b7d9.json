To reach (9, 5) in 3 moves: need to go RIGHT each time.  \n\nBut if I go RIGHT now to (7, 5), enemy at (9, 7) is not a collision risk yet.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn?**  \n\nEnemy could move LEFT from (9, 8) to (8, 8) \u2013 no conflict.  \nEnemy could move DOWN to (9, 7) \u2013 no conflict.  \nEnemy could move UP to (9, 9) \u2013 no conflict.  \nEnemy could move RIGHT \u2013 off board, so they won\u2019t.  \n\nSo no possible head-on collision this turn regardless of my move.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (6, 6):**  \nNext turn from (6, 6): body at (6, 5), tail at (6, 4).  \nPossible moves from (6, 6): UP (6,7), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6). DOWN is body.  \nLeaves me farther from (9,5) but maybe safer from enemy path.  \n\n**LEFT to (5, 5):**  \nNext turn from (5, 5): body at (6, 5), tail at (6, 4).  \nPossible moves: UP (5,6), LEFT (4,5), DOWN (5,4) \u2013 wait, (5,4) is empty? Yes, currently empty. Actually, tail is at (6,4), so (5,4) is free. So all 4 moves possible? Let\u2019s check:  \n- UP (5,6) free.  \n- DOWN (5,4) free.  \n- LEFT (4,5) free.  \n- RIGHT (6,5) \u2013 body, so not allowed.  \nSo 3 safe moves from (5,5) next turn.  \nBut moving LEFT now is away from (9,5).  \n\n**RIGHT to (7, 5):**  \nNext turn from (7, 5): body at (6, 5), tail at (6, 4).  \nPossible moves: UP (7,6), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4) \u2013 all free. LEFT (6,5) is body. So 3 safe moves.  \nThis moves me toward (9,5).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \n\nI want (9,5) apple before enemy gets it. Enemy is 3 moves away from it if they go straight down. I\u2019m 3 moves away if I go straight right.  \nIf I go RIGHT now, enemy goes DOWN now, we both arrive at (9,5) on turn 4? Let\u2019s check:  \n\nTurn 2 (now): Me (6,5) \u2192 (7,5), Enemy (9,8) \u2192 (9,7).  \nTurn 3: Me (7,5) \u2192 (8,5), Enemy (9,7) \u2192 (9,6).  \nTurn 4: Me (8,5) \u2192 (9,5), Enemy (9,6) \u2192 (9,5) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die. Bad.  \n\nSo if I race directly for (9,5), we tie and die.  \n\nBetter to let enemy get (9,5) and avoid collision? But I could instead go for other apples (1,6) or (1,7) or (2,1).  \n\nBut (1,6) and (1,7) are far; maybe enemy will go for (9,5) and I can go for (2,1) or (3,0).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Choose safest with options open:**  \n\nRIGHT risks future head-on if enemy goes for same apple.  \nUP gives me more space and time to decide.  \nLEFT takes me toward center and other apples (2,1) etc.  \n\nGiven enemy likely heading down toward (9,5), I should avoid that path for now.  \n\nUP to (6,6) seems safe and keeps options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (6,6), consider moving toward (1,6) or (1,7) via leftward moves, or (2,1) via down/left. Avoid (9,5) until enemy passes it or dies.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #0 is at (4,6) with body segment at (5,6).\n\nAvailable moves from (9,5):\n- UP: (9,6) - my own body (dangerous)\n- DOWN: (9,4) - safe, empty cell\n- LEFT: (8,5) - safe, empty cell\n- RIGHT: (10,5) - off the board (invalid) - DANGEROUS\n\nUP and RIGHT are eliminated. Only DOWN and LEFT are safe options.\n\nApple strategy: The nearest apples are on the left side of the board at (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), and (2,1). Moving LEFT would start heading in that general direction while maintaining options. Moving DOWN would keep me in the bottom-right corner but doesn't move me toward any apples.\n\nEnemy consideration: Snake #0 is at (4,6) and appears to be moving leftward (from (5,6) to (4,6)). It's currently in the middle-left area and doesn't pose an immediate threat to me in the bottom-right.\n\nFuture mobility: \n- If I move DOWN to (9,4): Next turn I could move DOWN to (9,3), LEFT to (8,4), or UP to (9,5) (but my body will be at (9,5) and (9,6), so UP would be dangerous).\n- If I move LEFT to (8,5): Next turn I could move UP to (8,6), DOWN to (8,4), or LEFT to (7,5).\n\nLEFT gives me better future options and starts moving me toward the apple cluster. DOWN keeps me in a corner with limited options.\n\nLong-term plan: Start moving leftward toward the apple cluster at (1,6), (1,7), and (2,7). Monitor enemy #0's movement pattern - it seems to be moving leftward as well. Be cautious of potential head-on collisions as we both move toward the same area.

From (9,5) possible moves:  \n- UP to (9,6) \u2013 its own body \u2192 suicide \u2192 unlikely.  \n- DOWN to (9,4) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- LEFT to (8,5) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 suicide.  \nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (9,4), it moves toward (3,0) or (2,1) eventually.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (8,5), it moves toward center.  \nI\u2019ll assume enemy avoids immediate suicide and picks DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5), no conflict with my safe moves.  \nIf enemy went LEFT to (8,5), my LEFT to (3,6) is far away.  \nSo no immediate head-on risk.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nApples: (1,6), (1,7), (2,1), (3,0), (2,7).  \nClosest to me:  \n- (1,6): distance |4-1|+|6-6| = 3  \n- (1,7): distance 4  \n- (2,7): distance |4-2|+|6-7| = 3  \n- (2,1): far  \n- (3,0): far  \n\n(1,6) and (2,7) are equally close in Manhattan distance.  \n(1,6) is left, (2,7) is up-left.  \nFrom (4,6):  \n- UP to (4,7) \u2192 closer to (2,7) (distance 2) and (1,7).  \n- LEFT to (3,6) \u2192 closer to (1,6) (distance 2) and (3,0) eventually.  \n- DOWN to (4,5) \u2192 away from most apples except (2,1) and (3,0) but longer path.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move:**  \nMy tail is at (5,6), next turn it will move to (6,6) because my body grows only if I eat an apple (I haven\u2019t eaten this turn). Wait \u2014 I ate 1 apple earlier, so my length is 2 (head + 1 body). If I don\u2019t eat an apple this turn, my tail moves forward: current body is [(5,6)], next turn body becomes [(new head), (4,6)], tail (5,6) disappears. So next turn my only body segment will be at (4,6) (current head). That gives me more space.  \n\nCheck:  \n- If I go UP to (4,7): next turn body at (4,6). From (4,7) safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (all empty except maybe enemy).  \n- If I go LEFT to (3,6): next turn body at (4,6). From (3,6) safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (all empty).  \n- If I go DOWN to (4,5): next turn body at (4,6). From (4,5) safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (all empty).  \n\nAll three keep 4 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI want to target (1,6) or (2,7).  \nUP gets me closer to (2,7) and (1,7).  \nLEFT gets me closer to (1,6) and (3,0).  \nEnemy is far right, so moving left is safer from enemy long-term.  \nBut (2,7) is also tempting.  \n\nLet\u2019s compare:  \nUP to (4,7): next turn I can go LEFT to (3,7) toward (2,7)/(1,7), or UP to (4,8) etc.  \nLEFT to (3,6): next turn I can go UP to (3,7) toward (2,7), or LEFT to (2,6) toward (1,6).  \nLEFT seems more flexible because from (3,6) I can go UP toward (2,7) or LEFT toward (1,6).  \nUP locks me into top row pursuit, but apples (1,7) and (2,7) are close together.  \n\nGiven enemy is far right, I\u2019ll go LEFT to stay central-left and keep both apple options open next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (3,6), assess if (1,6) is still there and if enemy is moving left. If enemy moves toward center, maybe switch to (2,7) by going UP next turn. Keep distance from enemy head.\n\nLEFT",

Check possible moves from (7,5)\n- **UP \u2192 (7,6)**: Empty, safe.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,4)**: Empty, safe.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,5)**: Empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,5)**: My tail is currently here \u2014 but is this safe?  \n  Last turn my body was at [(8,5)], so after I moved LEFT from (8,5) to (7,5), my tail should stay at (8,5) until I eat an apple. But I didn\u2019t eat an apple yet, so when I move, my tail will follow \u2014 my body segments will shift: head moves to new spot, the segment at (8,5) moves to (7,5) (old head). So next board state after moving RIGHT:  \n  Head \u2192 (8,5) (currently my tail), tail moves to where? Actually starting body segments positions:  \n  Body list was [(8,5)] before move \u2014 so after LEFT last turn:  \n  Head at (7,5); Body at [(?,?)]. Actually let\u2019s think systematically:  \n  Start of this turn: head at (7,5), body list: [(8,5)].  \n  If I move RIGHT now: head goes to (8,5), which is currently occupied by my body segment. That\u2019s a collision with my own body \u2014 deadly.  \n  \u2192 RIGHT is suicide.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Apples strategy  \nThe cluster at top-left: (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) \u2014 need to get there faster than snake #0.  \nSnake #0 at (3,7) can move DOWN to (3,6) (into its body \u2014 no), LEFT to (2,7) (apple!), UP to (3,8), RIGHT to (4,7).  \nSnake #0 is likely to move LEFT to (2,7) \u2014 gets apple and grows, potentially blocking me.\n\nMy path: currently at (7,5).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,5): Progress toward left side.  \n- UP \u2192 (7,6): slight progress up-left direction.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,4): away from apples.\n\nSo UP or LEFT are best for apples.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Enemy avoidance  \nIf snake #0 goes LEFT to (2,7) and eats apple, next turn its length will be 3, body at (3,7),(3,6). Its head at (2,7) \u2014 I\u2019m far away still.\n\nCould we collide heads in future? Not this turn, since I\u2019m too far.\n\nStill, being closer to apples lets me compete \u2014 so LEFT seems better than UP for minimizing future collision risk by approaching diagonally instead of heading straight up into its territory.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Check possible moves from (6,5)\n- **UP \u2192 (6,6)**: Empty, safe.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,4)**: Empty, safe.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,5)**: Empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,5)**: Occupied by my own body (tail) \u2014 deadly. So RIGHT is suicide.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Apples strategy\nThe closest apples are at (1,6) and (1,7) in the top-left. Snake #0 is at (2,7) with 2 apples and is well-positioned to take (1,7) and (1,6). It might also go for (0,9) or stay in the area.\n\nMy path from (6,5) to the top-left requires moving left and up. LEFT (to (5,5)) is directly toward the left side. UP (to (6,6)) is also progress, but less leftward. DOWN (to (6,4)) is away from the apples.\n\nSnake #0 at (2,7) has several options:\n- LEFT to (1,7): apple!\n- DOWN to (2,6): empty\n- UP to (2,8): empty\n- RIGHT to (3,7): its own body (deadly)\n\nSo it will likely go LEFT to (1,7) to eat the apple and grow. This would make it even larger and more dangerous.\n\nTo compete, I need to approach quickly. LEFT is the best direction to minimize distance.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Enemy avoidance\nIf snake #0 moves LEFT to (1,7), it will be at (1,7) with length 3 (body at (2,7) and (3,7)). I am at (6,5) \u2014 no immediate collision risk.\n\nHowever, if I move LEFT to (5,5), I am one step closer. Moving UP to (6,6) is also safe but less efficient.\n\nMoving DOWN (6,4) is safe but puts me further away and might lead to dead ends later.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility\nFrom (5,5):\n- Next moves: UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4), LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5) \u2014 all likely safe unless enemy moves in.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n- Next moves: UP (6,7), DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6) \u2014 also good.\n\nLEFT is better for long-term pathing to the apples and avoids being too close to the enemy prematurely.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan**: Continue moving left (toward x=0) to approach the apple cluster at (1,6)/(1,7). Be cautious of snake #0 which may dominate that area. If it blocks, consider alternative apples like (2,1) or (3,0) to the south. Avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nLEFT",

Last turn it was at (1,6) with body extending to (3,6). From the board state, it appears to be heading left/down? But we need to consider its possible moves.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move from your head (4,5):\n\n1. UP: (4,6) - Check if safe:\n   - Within board? Yes (y=6 is valid).\n   - Not your own body? Your body is at (5,5) - no conflict.\n   - Not enemy body? Enemy body is at (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,6) - (4,6) is clear.\n   - So UP is safe.\n\n2. DOWN: (4,4) - Check:\n   - Within board? Yes.\n   - Not your body? (5,5) is not (4,4).\n   - Not enemy body? Enemy body doesn't include (4,4).\n   - However, (4,4) has an apple! So if you move here, you eat it and grow.\n   - So DOWN is safe and gets an apple.\n\n3. LEFT: (3,5) - Check:\n   - Within board? Yes.\n   - Not your body? (5,5) is not (3,5).\n   - Not enemy body? Enemy body is at (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,6) - (3,5) is clear.\n   - So LEFT is safe.\n\n4. RIGHT: (5,5) - Check:\n   - This is your own body segment! So moving RIGHT would kill you.\n   - Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- DOWN (4,4) has an apple! This is very attractive because it gives you an immediate point and grows your snake. Also, it moves you away from the enemy snake which is currently at (1,6) and might be moving towards the top-left apples.\n- UP (4,6) is safe but doesn't get an apple immediately.\n- LEFT (3,5) is safe but doesn't get an apple.\n\nThe enemy snake (head at (1,6)) has several options:\n- It can go UP to (1,7) but that is its own body? Actually its body is at (1,7) so that would kill it. So UP is not safe for it.\n- DOWN to (1,5) - safe? Check: not its body (which is at (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,6)) so yes.\n- LEFT to (0,6) - safe? Yes.\n- RIGHT to (2,6) - safe? Its body is at (2,7) and (3,7), (3,6) - so (2,6) is clear.\n\nSo enemy might go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. It might be attracted to the apple at (0,9) or (2,1) or (3,0). But (0,9) is far, (2,1) and (3,0) are closer.\n\nYour move DOWN to (4,4) gets an apple and grows. After eating, your snake will have head at (4,4) and body segments at (4,5) and (5,5). This puts you in a good position to potentially go to (3,4) or (4,3) or (5,4) next turn.\n\nLong-term: After getting this apple, consider moving towards the bottom-left apples (2,1) and (3,0) which are not heavily contested by the enemy (who is currently at top-left). The enemy might be going for (0,9) or the bottom apples too, but you are closer to (2,1) and (3,0).\n\nSo prioritize DOWN to get the apple and grow.\n\nFinal move: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

But in the board state, (4,4) is your head and there is no apple shown there now. The apples listed are (2,1), (3,0), (0,9), (6,0), (9,8). So you must have eaten the apple at (4,4) last turn? Actually, the board shows \"1\" at (4,4) which is your head, and the apples are listed without (4,4). So yes, you ate it.\n\nEnemy snake (ID 0):\n- Head: (1,5)\n- Body: [(1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7)] (length 5 segments, 4 apples)\n\nApples: (2,1), (3,0), (0,9), (6,0), (9,8)\n\nNow, possible moves from your head (4,4):\n\n1. UP: (4,5) - This is your own body segment! So unsafe.\n2. DOWN: (4,3) - Check: within board? Yes. Not your body? Your body is at (4,5) and (5,5) - clear. Not enemy body? Enemy body is at (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7) - clear. So safe.\n3. LEFT: (3,4) - Safe? Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (5,4) - Safe? Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- There is an apple at (3,0) and (2,1) to the bottom-left. Moving DOWN or LEFT gets you closer.\n- There is an apple at (6,0) to the bottom-right.\n- The enemy is at (1,5) which is top-left. It might be going for (0,9) or the bottom apples too.\n\nConsider enemy moves from (1,5):\n- It cannot go UP to (1,6) because that is its body.\n- DOWN to (1,4) - safe? Not its body.\n- LEFT to (0,5) - safe.\n- RIGHT to (2,5) - safe.\n\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. It might go DOWN towards (2,1) or (3,0).\n\nYou are closer to (3,0) and (2,1) than the enemy. So moving LEFT or DOWN is good to get those apples.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: after moving DOWN to (4,3), you can go LEFT to (3,3) then DOWN to (3,2) etc. Or after LEFT to (3,4), you can go DOWN to (3,3) etc.\n\nRIGHT to (5,4) leads to (6,0) apple but that is farther and might be riskier if enemy moves that way.\n\nPrioritize the closer apples: (3,0) is at y=0, so moving DOWN repeatedly is efficient.\n\nAlso, avoid potential head-on collision with enemy? Enemy head at (1,5) is not too close to you right now.\n\nBest move: DOWN to (4,3) to start descending towards the bottom apples.\n\nPlan for next turns: After DOWN, continue moving down/left to collect (3,0) and (2,1).

UP: (4,4) - This is your own body segment! Unsafe.\n2. DOWN: (4,2) - Within board? Yes. Not your body? Your body is at (4,4) and (4,5) - clear. Not enemy body? Enemy body is at (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) - clear. Safe.\n3. LEFT: (3,3) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (5,3) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- There are apples at (2,1) and (3,0) to the bottom-left. Moving DOWN or LEFT gets you closer.\n- The enemy head is at (1,4). It might be going for the same apples. From (1,4), enemy can move:\n  - UP: (1,5) - its own body, unsafe.\n  - DOWN: (1,3) - safe.\n  - LEFT: (0,4) - safe.\n  - RIGHT: (2,4) - safe.\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. It might go DOWN towards (1,3) to get to (2,1) or (3,0).\n\nYou are closer to (3,0) and (2,1) than the enemy. Your head at (4,3) is 3 steps from (3,0) (e.g., LEFT to (3,3), DOWN to (3,2), DOWN to (3,1), DOWN to (3,0)) and 4 steps from (2,1). Enemy head at (1,4) is 4 steps from (3,0) and 3 steps from (2,1). So you have a slight advantage for (3,0), while enemy has advantage for (2,1).\n\nTo avoid head-on collision, don't move directly towards enemy. Moving LEFT to (3,3) is safe and gets you closer to (3,0). Moving DOWN to (4,2) also gets you closer but is less direct.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: After LEFT to (3,3), you can go DOWN to (3,2) and then further down. After DOWN to (4,2), you can go LEFT to (3,2) or DOWN to (4,1).\n\nRIGHT to (5,3) leads to the apple at (6,0) but that is farther and not urgent.\n\nPlan for next turns: Continue moving towards the bottom-left apples (3,0) and (2,1). Avoid moving directly into enemy's path. The enemy might be descending too, so be cautious. After collecting these, consider the apple at (6,0) or (9,8).\n\nBest move: LEFT to (3,3) to get closer to (3,0) and avoid potential conflict with enemy moving down.\n\nLEFT",

Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- The nearby apples are at (2,1) and (3,0). Moving DOWN to (3,1) gets you closer to (3,0) (next step to (3,0)). Moving LEFT to (2,2) gets you closer to (2,1) (next step to (2,1) or (2,2) to (2,1)).\n- The enemy head is at (1,2). From (1,2), enemy can move:\n  - UP: (1,3) - its own body, unsafe.\n  - DOWN: (1,1) - safe.\n  - LEFT: (0,2) - safe.\n  - RIGHT: (2,2) - safe.\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.

So avoid LEFT.\n\nSimilarly, if you move DOWN to (3,1), enemy might move DOWN to (1,1) and then later conflict, but no immediate collision.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4,2) is safe but moves away from the apples.\n\nPlan: Continue towards the bottom apples. Since enemy is closer to (2,1), focus on (3,0). Move DOWN to (3,1) to get one step away from (3,0). Next turn, you can go DOWN to (3,0) to eat the apple. Be cautious of enemy moving down as well - if enemy goes to (1,1), it might try to cut you off, but (3,0) is still reachable.\n\nAlso, note that moving RIGHT to (4,2) is safe but less optimal for apples. However, it might be a good alternative if we want to avoid the enemy entirely and go for other apples later, but since (3,0) is very close, it's better to go for it.\n\nBest move: DOWN to (3,1) to progress towards (3,0) and avoid potential head-on collision at (2,2).\n\nStrategy for next turns: After DOWN, move DOWN again to (3,0) to eat the apple. Then, consider going LEFT to (2,0) or RIGHT to (4,0) to avoid the enemy. Alternatively, if enemy takes (2,1), you can go for (6,0) or (0,9) later.\n\nDOWN",

Safe and beneficial.\n3. LEFT: (2,1) - Within board. Not your body. There is an apple at (2,1)! But enemy head is at (1,1). If enemy moves RIGHT to (2,1) and you move LEFT to (2,1), head-on collision occurs. Risky.\n4. RIGHT: (4,1) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving DOWN to (3,0) eats the apple immediately. This grows your snake to 4 segments (3 apples collected) and removes (3,0) from the board.\n- Moving LEFT to (2,1) also eats an apple, but there is a high risk of head-on collision with enemy snake #0 (head at (1,1)). Enemy can move:\n  - UP: (1,2) - its own body, unsafe.\n  - DOWN: (1,0) - safe.\n  - LEFT: (0,1) - safe.\n  - RIGHT: (2,1) - safe and leads to apple.\nSo enemy might move RIGHT to (2,1) to eat the apple. If you both go to (2,1), both die. Avoid LEFT.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,1) is safe but doesn't get an apple immediately.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (3,0) to safely eat the apple and avoid any collision risk with the enemy.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,0), your snake will grow: new head at (3,0), body becomes [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] (so length 4). Then you can consider next moves: from (3,0), you can go LEFT to (2,0), RIGHT to (4,0), or UP to (3,1) (but that is your body now). So safe moves would be LEFT and RIGHT. You can then plan to go towards (6,0) or (0,9) or avoid the enemy.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (1,1) and might go for (2,1) or (1,0). If it goes to (2,1), it eats the apple there and grows. But you are safe at (3,0) and can retreat to the left or right.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (3,0), consider moving LEFT to (2,0) to potentially go for (0,9) later or RIGHT to (4,0) to go for (6,0). Avoid the enemy which is larger and has more apples. Since enemy has 4 apples and you will have 3, you need to catch up. But safety first.\n\nDOWN",

Also, there is an apple at (1,7) and (2,7) above, but you need to navigate safely.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,0): This is safe. From (4,0), you can go UP to (4,1), RIGHT to (5,0), or LEFT (back to (3,0)). There is an apple at (6,0) to the right.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,1). It can move:\n- UP: (2,2) - safe? Not its body? Its body is at (1,2) and (1,3) etc. Actually, (2,2) is free? Board shows at (2,2): from the board state, (2,2) is empty? Actually, the board has at (2,2): in the grid, row 2: \". T . T . ...\" so (2,2) is empty (dot). So enemy can go UP.\n- DOWN: (2,0) - safe? (2,0) is empty. But if you move LEFT to (2,0), and enemy moves DOWN to (2,0), head-on collision! Both die.\n- LEFT: (1,1) - its own body? Its body includes (1,1) (first body segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (3,1) - your body? Your body is at (3,1). Unsafe for enemy.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (2,0), and you move LEFT to (2,0), both heads collide and both die. This is bad for you (you have fewer apples). So avoid LEFT if enemy might go DOWN.\n\nWhat is the likelihood enemy goes DOWN? Enemy might prefer UP to go towards apples at (1,7) and (2,7) which are above. But also, enemy might avoid going into your body (RIGHT to (3,1) is unsafe) and LEFT is unsafe. So only UP and DOWN are safe. Enemy might choose UP to go towards apples. However, we cannot be sure.\n\nTo be safe, moving RIGHT to (4,0) avoids any risk of collision with enemy. Then from (4,0), you can go towards the apple at (6,0) (which is close) or plan to go up later.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT gives you more options: from (4,0), you can go UP to (4,1), RIGHT to (5,0), or even LEFT back. Whereas LEFT to (2,0) might lead to a dead-end if enemy blocks above.\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, aim to get the apple at (6,0) by moving rightwards. Then consider going up to (6,1) etc. Avoid enemy snake #0 which is larger. Also, note the apples at (1,7) and (2,7) are far and might be targeted by enemy. You can also consider the apple at (0,9) later, but that is far.\n\nSo, prefer RIGHT to (4,0) to safely move away from enemy and towards the apple at (6,0).\n\nRIGHT",

Or immediately? In this game, \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\" means immediately after move, your body is longer for collision purposes next turn. So if enemy moved to (3,0) last turn, it would have grown instantly, so its body this turn would be head at (3,0) + old head (3,1) + (3,2) + (3,3)? But that\u2019s length 4. But board shows enemy length 3 last turn.  \n\nLet\u2019s check given board state at start of last turn:  \nEnemy head: (3,0), body: [(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)] \u2192 length 4? Wait, that\u2019s head + 3 body segments = total length 4. But apples collected: 3. That matches: length = apples + 1 (starting length 1). Yes, so enemy length 4.  \n\nSo last turn enemy at (3,0) with body [(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)]. Then safe moves from (3,0):  \n- UP \u2192 (3,1) \u2013 its own body \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,0) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,0) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo enemy chose LEFT to (2,0) or RIGHT to (4,0).  \n\nIf enemy went LEFT to (2,0), then this turn enemy head at (2,0), body: [(3,0),(3,1),(3,2)] (length 4).  \nIf enemy went RIGHT to (4,0), then enemy head at (4,0), body: [(3,0),(3,1),(3,2)] (length 4).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Check my possible moves vs possible enemy positions:**  \n\n**UP to (2,2):**  \n- If enemy at (2,0), enemy could move UP to (2,1) (my old head) \u2013 no collision.  \n- If enemy at (4,0), enemy could move UP to (4,1) \u2013 no collision.  \nSafe either way.  \n\n**DOWN to (2,0):**  \n- If enemy at (2,0) already, head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \n- If enemy at (4,0), then (2,0) empty \u2192 safe.  \nRisky if enemy went LEFT last turn.  \n\n**RIGHT to (3,1):**  \n- If enemy at (2,0), enemy could move RIGHT to (3,0) or UP to (2,1) \u2013 no collision.  \n- If enemy at (4,0), enemy could move LEFT to (3,0) or UP to (4,1) \u2013 no collision.  \nSafe either way.  \n\nSo DOWN is risky if enemy is at (2,0).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nApples: (0,9), (6,0), (9,8), (1,7), (2,7).  \nFrom (2,1):  \n- UP \u2192 (2,2) \u2013 closer to (1,7),(2,7).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,1) \u2013 not closer to any apple directly.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,0) \u2013 closer to (6,0).  \n\nBut (2,7) is close: from (2,2) it\u2019s 5 steps away.  \n(6,0) is farther from (2,0) but reachable.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n\n**UP to (2,2):**  \nNext turn from (2,2), body: head (2,2), then (2,1),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5) (length 7).  \nPossible moves:  \nUP (2,3) empty, DOWN (2,1) my body, LEFT (1,2) my body, RIGHT (3,2) empty.  \n2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT).  \n\n**RIGHT to (3,1):**  \nNext turn from (3,1), body: head (3,1), then (2,1),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5).  \nPossible moves:  \nUP (3,2) empty, DOWN (3,0) possibly enemy? But enemy could be there, check: if enemy at (2,0) or (4,0), (3,0) empty. LEFT (2,1) my body, RIGHT (4,1) empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves likely (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n**DOWN to (2,0):**  \nIf safe (enemy not there), next turn from (2,0), body: head (2,0), then (2,1),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5).  \nMoves: UP (2,1) my body, DOWN off board, LEFT (1,0) empty, RIGHT (3,0) possibly enemy? Could be risky.  \nOnly 1 definitely safe move (LEFT) \u2192 risky.  \n\nSo DOWN is bad for future options even if safe now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN is risky now (possible head-on) and bad future.  \nRIGHT gives good future options but no immediate apple.  \nUP gives path toward apples (1,7),(2,7) and safe now.  \n\nGiven enemy could be at (2,0), I should avoid DOWN. Between UP and RIGHT, UP moves toward apples, RIGHT moves toward center.  \nI\u2019ll go UP to start moving toward the cluster of apples at y=7.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter UP to (2,2), next turn aim for (2,3) or (3,2) to approach (2,7)/(1,7). Keep an eye on enemy location; if enemy is at (2,0), it may move up toward apples too. Try to stay ahead in length to block or avoid.  \n\nUP",

UP: (4,1) - Within board. Not your body (your body is at (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)). Not enemy body (enemy body is at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) - (4,1) is clear). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (4,-1) - Off the board (y=-1). Dies. Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (3,0) - This is your own body (first body segment). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (5,0) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving UP to (4,1): This is safe. From (4,1), you can later go UP to (4,2), LEFT to (3,1) (your body? (3,1) is your body, so unsafe next turn unless you grow), RIGHT to (5,1), or DOWN to (4,0) (which is safe but not progress). There are apples above at (1,7) and (2,7), but they are far and enemy might be heading there.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,0): This is safe. From (5,0), you can go UP to (5,1), RIGHT to (6,0) (which has an apple!), or LEFT to (4,0). The apple at (6,0) is very close.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,2). It can move:\n- UP: (2,3) - safe? Not its body (its body is at (2,1), (1,1), etc.). Not your body. Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,1) - its own body? Its body includes (2,1) (first body segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,2) - its own body? Its body includes (1,2). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (3,2) - your body? Your body is at (3,2). Unsafe for enemy.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: only UP to (2,3).\n\nTherefore, enemy will definitely move UP to (2,3). This means enemy is moving away from you and towards the apples at (1,7) and (2,7). So no immediate collision risk.\n\nGiven this, moving RIGHT to (5,0) gets you closer to the apple at (6,0). Next turn, you can move RIGHT again to (6,0) to eat the apple and grow. This is efficient and safe.\n\nMoving UP to (4,1) doesn't get you closer to any apple immediately. The apple at (6,0) is still accessible from (4,1) but requires more moves (e.g., RIGHT then DOWN, but DOWN from (5,1) to (5,0) is safe? Actually, (5,0) would be safe if you don't have body there). However, moving RIGHT now is more direct.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (6,0), you can consider going up to avoid getting trapped along the bottom edge. But for now, grabbing the nearby apple is best.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (6,0), you'll have 4 apples. Then you can move UP to (6,1) and then leftwards or upwards to target other apples. Avoid the enemy which is larger and heading north. The apples at (0,9) and (9,8) are also options later.\n\nSo, prefer RIGHT to (5,0) to get closer to the apple at (6,0).\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN: (5,-1) - Off the board (y=-1). Dies. Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (4,0) - This is your own body (first body segment). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (6,0) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe. Also, there is an apple at (6,0)!\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,0): This is safe and lands directly on an apple. You will eat the apple, grow to length 5 (4 body segments), and score your 4th apple. After eating, your body will be [(6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1)]? Actually, the head moves to (6,0) and the tail doesn't move because you grow. So new body: head at (6,0), then (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1) as tail. This is efficient and gets you closer to the enemy's score.\n\n- Moving UP to (5,1): This is safe but doesn't get an apple immediately. From (5,1), you can later go UP to (5,2), LEFT to (4,1), RIGHT to (6,1), or DOWN to (5,0). However, the apple at (6,0) is still nearby, but moving UP delays eating it.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,3). It can move:\n- UP: (2,4) - safe? Not its body (its body is at (2,2), (2,1), etc.). Not your body. Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,2) - its own body? Its body includes (2,2) (first body segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,3) - its own body? Its body includes (1,3). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - safe? Not its body. Not your body (your body is at (3,0), (3,1), etc.). Safe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP to (2,4) and RIGHT to (3,3).\n\nThe enemy will likely move towards the apples at (1,7) and (2,7), so UP is probable. But RIGHT to (3,3) is also possible. However, (3,3) is not near you, so no immediate collision risk.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (6,0) is highly advantageous: you get an apple and grow. This is the best move.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,0), you'll be at (6,0) with length 5. Next turn, you can consider moving UP to (6,1) to avoid being trapped along the bottom edge (since DOWN is off board and LEFT is your body). From (6,1), you can access more of the board and target other apples like (9,8) or (0,9). Avoid the enemy which is larger and heading north.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (6,0), move UP to (6,1) to open options. Then consider moving leftwards or upwards to target apples at (9,8) or (0,9). The enemy has 5 apples and is likely to get more from (1,7) or (2,7), so you need to catch up. Avoid head-on collisions with the enemy since it is larger.\n\nSo, prefer RIGHT to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Now you have grown to length 5.\n\nApples at: (0,9), (9,8), (1,7), (2,7), (0,3)  [Note: the apple at (6,0) is gone]\n\nEnemy snake (ID 0):\n- Head: (2,4)\n- Body: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)] (length 6 segments, 5 apples)\n\nPossible moves from your head (6,0):\n1.

Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving UP to (6,1): This opens up more options for future moves (you can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT from there). Currently, you are trapped along the bottom edge with only two safe moves (UP and RIGHT). Moving UP gets you away from the edge and gives more flexibility.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,0): This keeps you along the bottom edge. From (7,0), next turn you would have safe moves: UP to (7,1) and RIGHT to (8,0) (since LEFT would be (6,0) which is your head's previous position? Actually, your body will be [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,1)] after moving RIGHT. So (6,0) is your body now, so LEFT from (7,0) would be (6,0) which is your body - unsafe. Similarly, DOWN off board. So only UP and RIGHT would be safe from (7,0). So moving RIGHT now leads to a similar constrained situation next turn.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,4). It can move:\n- UP: (2,5) - safe? Not its body (its body is at (2,3), etc.). Not your body. Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,3) - its own body? Its body includes (2,3) (first body segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,4) - safe? Not its body. Not your body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,4) - safe? Not its body. Not your body. Safe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. It will likely move towards the apples at (1,7) and (2,7) so UP is probable. It might also go LEFT or RIGHT to avoid obstacles.\n\nLong-term plan: You need to catch up to the enemy (5 apples vs your 4). The apples at (0,9) and (9,8) are far, but (0,3) is closer. However, (0,3) is near the enemy's territory. Moving UP to (6,1) gives you access to go towards (0,9) or (9,8) via the top. Alternatively, you could go leftwards to (0,3) but be cautious of the enemy.\n\nAfter moving UP to (6,1), next turn you can go UP to (6,2), LEFT to (5,1), or RIGHT to (7,1). All these are likely safe. This keeps options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0) leads to a constrained path along the bottom. It is safer to move UP to get more space.\n\nTherefore, prefer UP to (6,1) to avoid being trapped and to open future moves.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (6,1), consider moving UP to (6,2) and then LEFT to (5,2), (4,2), etc. to approach the apple at (0,9) or (9,8). Alternatively, you can go RIGHT to (7,1) and then UP to (7,2) to approach (9,8). Avoid the enemy which is larger and heading north.\n\nUP",

Actually, apple list now: (0,9), (9,8), (1,7), (2,7), (0,3). So (6,0) apple is gone. Enemy might move toward (0,3) or (9,8).  \n\nI\u2019m ahead 5 apples to 4, so I can play safe and go for nearest apple: (0,3) is closest to my current position (Manhattan distance 3 via LEFT then DOWN).

UP: (6,2) - Within board. Not your body (your body is at (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0)). Not enemy body (enemy body is at (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1)). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (6,0) - This is your own body (first body segment). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (5,1) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (7,1) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving UP to (6,2): This continues upward, opening access to the top half of the board where apples (0,9), (9,8), (1,7), (2,7) are located. From (6,2), you can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn (likely safe). This is a good direction to pursue apples.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,1): This moves you leftwards, which is towards the apple at (0,3) but also closer to the enemy snake. The enemy is at (2,5) and might move towards (1,7) or (2,7). However, (5,1) is still safe and gives options to go UP to (5,2) or LEFT to (4,1) next.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,1): This moves you rightwards, towards the apple at (9,8) but also away from the enemy. From (7,1), you can go UP to (7,2) or RIGHT to (8,1) next.\n\nLong-term plan: You need to catch up to the enemy (5 apples vs your 4). The apples at (1,7) and (2,7) are close to the enemy, so it might get them soon. The apple at (0,3) is near your current position but also near the enemy's body. The apples at (0,9) and (9,8) are far but safer.\n\nGiven that the enemy is larger (length 6) and you are length 5, avoid direct confrontation. Moving UP to (6,2) is a neutral move that keeps you centered and allows flexibility to go left or right later. Moving LEFT might bring you too close to the enemy. Moving RIGHT is safe but might lead to the edge.\n\nConsider enemy moves: Enemy head at (2,5) can move UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4) (its body, unsafe), LEFT to (1,5), or RIGHT to (3,5). It will likely go UP towards (1,7) or (2,7). So it is moving north, away from you.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (6,2) is good to also follow the apples north. LEFT is acceptable but less urgent. RIGHT is fine but not optimal.\n\nTo maximize future options and move towards apples, UP is best.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (6,2), consider moving UP to (6,3) or LEFT to (5,2) to approach the cluster at (1,7) and (2,7). Alternatively, you can go RIGHT to (7,2) to approach (9,8). Avoid the enemy which is heading to (1,7) or (2,7).\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nYour snake (ID 1):\n- Head: (6, 2)\n- Body: [(6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)] (length 5 segments, 4 apples collected)\n\nApples at: (0,9), (9,8), (1,7), (2,7), (0,3)\n\nEnemy snake (ID 0):\n- Head: (2,6)\n- Body: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)] (length 6 segments, 5 apples)\n\nPossible moves from your head (6,2):\n1. UP: (6,3) - Within board. Not your body (your body is at (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0)). Not enemy body (enemy body is at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (6,1) - This is your own body (first body segment). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (5,2) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (7,2) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving UP to (6,3): Continues upward towards the apples at (1,7) and (2,7). From (6,3), you can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn. This is a good direction to pursue apples.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,2): Moves you leftwards, closer to the apple at (0,3) but also closer to the enemy snake. The enemy is at (2,6) and might move towards (1,7) or (2,7). However, (5,2) is safe and gives options.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,2): Moves you rightwards, towards the apple at (9,8). From (7,2), you can go UP to (7,3) or RIGHT to (8,2) next.\n\nLong-term plan: The enemy has 5 apples (you have 4) and is near the apples at (1,7) and (2,7). It will likely try to eat one of those. You should also aim for those apples to catch up. Moving UP gets you closer to that cluster. Moving LEFT also gets you closer but might risk collision with the enemy if it moves south. Moving RIGHT is safe but takes you away from the immediate apples.\n\nConsider enemy moves: Enemy head at (2,6) can move UP to (2,7) (apple), DOWN to (2,5) (its body, unsafe), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6). It will likely go UP to (2,7) to eat the apple. So it will be at (2,7) next turn and grow to length 7.\n\nIf you move UP to (6,3), you are still 4 cells away from (2,7) (Manhattan distance), while the enemy is adjacent. So you won't get that apple, but you can aim for (1,7) or others. Alternatively, you could go LEFT to (5,2) to be closer to (0,3) which is uncontested.\n\nHowever, (0,3) is near the enemy's body (which is along x=2 from y=1 to y=5), so it might be risky. The enemy is focused north, so (0,3) might be safe.\n\nTo maximize options and move towards multiple apples, UP is best. It keeps you centered and allows you to go left or right later.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (6,3), consider moving LEFT to (5,3) to approach (1,7) or (0,3), or UP to (6,4) to continue north. Avoid the enemy which will be at (2,7) and likely moving further north.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move.\n\nUP",

UP: (6,4) - Within board. Not your body (your body is at (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0)). Not enemy body (enemy body is at (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (6,2) - This is your own body (first body segment). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (5,3) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (7,3) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving UP to (6,4): Continues upward towards the apples at (0,9) and (1,7). From (6,4), you can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn. This is a good direction to pursue apples.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,3): Moves you leftwards, closer to the apple at (0,3) and (1,7). The enemy is at (2,7) and might be moving north. (5,3) is safe and gives options.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,3): Moves you rightwards, towards the apple at (9,8). From (7,3), you can go UP to (7,4) or RIGHT to (8,3) next.\n\nEnemy analysis: Enemy head is at (2,7). It just ate the apple at (2,7) (since it was there and now has 6 apples) and grew. It can now move UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6) (its body, unsafe), LEFT to (1,7) (apple), or RIGHT to (3,7). It will likely go LEFT to (1,7) to eat that apple or UP to (2,8). So (1,7) might be taken soon.\n\nLong-term: You have 4 apples vs enemy 6. You need to catch up. The closest apples are (1,7) and (0,3). (0,0) is also close but near your tail. (0,9) and (9,8) are farther.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,3) gets you closer to (0,3) and (1,7). However, if enemy goes to (1,7) this turn, it will be there and grow. Then you might not get it. But (0,3) is still available.\n\nMoving UP to (6,4) is also good to position for north apples.\n\nMoving RIGHT is safer but takes you away from the main apple cluster.\n\nPlan: Aim for (0,3) and (1,7). From (6,3), moving LEFT to (5,3) is the most direct. Then next turn, you can go LEFT to (4,3) and so on. The enemy is at (2,7) and might not come south immediately.\n\nAlso, note (0,0) is an apple, but it's near your tail (at (5,0) and (6,0)), so you might be able to loop back later.\n\nTo maximize progress towards the left-side apples, LEFT is best. It also keeps UP and DOWN options open next turn.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nYour snake (ID 1):\n- Head: (4, 3)\n- Body: [(5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)] (length 5 segments, 4 apples collected)\nApples at: (0,9), (9,8), (0,3), (0,0), (8,4)\nEnemy snake (ID 0):\n- Head: (1, 8)\n- Body: [(1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)] (length 8 segments, 7 apples)\n\nPossible moves from your head (4,3):\n1. UP: (4,4) - Within board. Not your body (your body is at (5,3), (6,3), etc.). Not enemy body (enemy body is at (1,7), (2,7), etc.). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (4,2) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n3. LEFT: (3,3) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (5,3) - This is your own body (first body segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving UP to (4,4): Moves you north. This gets you closer to the apple at (8,4) and (0,9). From (4,4), you can go RIGHT to (5,4) and then continue towards (8,4). Also, the enemy is at (1,8) which is north-west, so you might avoid it.\n- Moving DOWN to (4,2): Moves you south. This is away from most apples, but the apple at (0,0) is south-west. However, your tail is at (6,1), so (0,0) might be risky.\n- Moving LEFT to (3,3): Moves you west towards the apple at (0,3). This is a direct path. From (3,3), you can go LEFT to (2,3), (1,3), (0,3). But note the enemy is at (1,8) and its body runs along x=2 from y=2 to y=7. So moving to (2,3) would be adjacent to enemy body, but not directly hitting it.\n\nEnemy analysis: Enemy head is at (1,8). It can move UP to (1,9), DOWN to (1,7) (its body, unsafe), LEFT to (0,8), or RIGHT to (2,8). It will likely go UP or LEFT to avoid its body. The apple at (0,9) is north-west, so it might go UP or LEFT. It might also go RIGHT to (2,8) which is safe? Actually, (2,8) is not in its body (its body is at (2,7) and below). So it has safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLong-term: You have 4 apples vs enemy 7. You need to catch up. The closest apples are (0,3) and (8,4). (0,0) is also close but near your tail. (0,9) and (9,8) are farther.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3) continues your path towards (0,3). This is good.\nMoving UP to (4,4) starts a path towards (8,4) and also keeps you away from the enemy.\n\nHowever, note that the enemy body blocks the entire column x=2 from y=2 to y=7. So if you go LEFT to (3,3), you can then go to (2,3) which is adjacent to enemy body at (2,2) and (2,4). But it is safe as long as you don't hit it. Then to (1,3) and (0,3). But the enemy head is at (1,8), so it might not interfere.\n\nBut consider: if you go LEFT to (3,3), you are committing to the west path. Next turn, you can go LEFT to (2,3) which is safe (not enemy body). Then to (1,3) and (0,3). This is 3 moves to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, going UP to (4,4) opens a path to the east/north. From (4,4), you can go RIGHT to (5,4), then (6,4), (7,4), (8,4) to eat the apple at (8,4) in 4 moves. This is also viable.\n\nWhich is safer? The enemy is at (1,8) and might move towards (0,9) or (9,8). It is less likely to come south to (1,3) soon. So both paths are safe.\n\nBut to maximize options, moving UP to (4,4) gives you more freedom: from there, you can go LEFT to (3,4) to continue west, or RIGHT to (5,4) to go east, or UP to (4,5) to go north. This keeps multiple paths open.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3) narrows your options: you can only go UP, DOWN, or LEFT next turn. But it gets you closer to (0,3).\n\nGiven that the enemy has 7 apples and you have 4, you need to be efficient. The apple at (0,3) is 3 moves away via LEFT, while (8,4) is 4 moves away via UP+RIGHT. So (0,3) is closer.\n\nHowever, last turn you moved LEFT to get to (4,3). Continuing LEFT is consistent.\n\nBut let's think about the board: the enemy body is a barrier at x=2. So if you go to (3,3), you are one step away from that barrier. Then you have to go to (2,3) which is safe, but then you are trapped between the barrier and the west wall. From (2,3), you can only go UP, DOWN, or LEFT (to (1,3)). This might be restrictive.\n\nIn contrast, moving UP to (4,4) avoids that barrier and gives more space.\n\nSo for flexibility, UP is better.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (4,4), consider going RIGHT to (5,4) to approach (8,4), or LEFT to (3,4) to still consider (0,3) from a higher route. This keeps options open.\n\nTherefore, choose UP.\n\nUP",

UP: (4,5) - Within board. Not your body (your body is at (4,3), (5,3), etc.). Not enemy body (enemy body is at (1,8), (1,7), (2,7), etc.). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (4,3) - This is your own body (first body segment). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (3,4) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (5,4) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving UP to (4,5): Moves you north. This gets you closer to the apples at (0,9) and (9,8). However, the enemy is at (2,8) which is north-west. From (4,5), you can go LEFT to (3,5) to approach (0,9) or RIGHT to (5,5) to approach (9,8). This also avoids the enemy body barrier at x=2.\n- Moving LEFT to (3,4): Moves you west towards the apple at (0,3) and (0,0). But note the enemy body runs along x=2 from y=3 to y=7. So (3,4) is adjacent to that barrier. Next move, you could go LEFT to (2,4) which is enemy body? Actually, enemy body includes (2,4) (from its body list: ... (2,4), (2,3)). So (2,4) is unsafe. Therefore, from (3,4), you cannot go LEFT to (2,4). You could go UP to (3,5) or DOWN to (3,3). This restricts your options.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,4): Moves you east towards the apple at (8,4). This is a clear path with no immediate barriers. From (5,4), you can continue RIGHT to (6,4), (7,4), (8,4) to eat the apple in 3 moves. This is efficient.\n\nEnemy analysis: Enemy head is at (2,8). It can move UP to (2,9), DOWN to (2,7) (its body, unsafe), LEFT to (1,8) (its body, unsafe), or RIGHT to (3,8). So its only safe move is UP to (2,9) or RIGHT to (3,8). It will likely go UP to (2,9) to get closer to the apple at (0,9) or (9,8). So it is moving away from you.\n\nGiven that you have 4 apples vs enemy 7, you need to catch up quickly. The closest apple is (8,4) which is 3 moves away via RIGHT. The apple at (0,3) is 4 moves away (LEFT to (3,4), then UP/DOWN? Actually, to get to (0,3) from (3,4), you would need to go DOWN to (3,3) and then LEFT to (2,3) (but (2,3) is enemy body? Enemy body includes (2,3) - so unsafe). So you cannot go to (2,3). Therefore, the path to (0,3) is blocked by the enemy body. You would have to go around via north: from (3,4) go UP to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (but (2,5) is enemy body? Yes, enemy body has (2,5)). So it's completely blocked. Similarly, (0,0) is even farther and also blocked by enemy body at x=2.\n\nTherefore, the apples at (0,3) and (0,0) are currently unreachable due to the enemy body barrier. The apples at (0,9) and (9,8) are far and the enemy is heading that way.\n\nThe best option is to go for (8,4) via RIGHT. This is safe and efficient.\n\nSo move RIGHT to (5,4).\n\nThis also keeps your options open: from (5,4), you can continue RIGHT to (6,4) etc., or go UP to (5,5) to head north, or DOWN to (5,3) (but (5,3) is your body? Actually, your body has (5,3), so next turn you cannot go DOWN from (5,4) to (5,3) because it will be your body. But you can go UP or RIGHT).\n\nPlan for next turns: Move RIGHT to (5,4), then RIGHT to (6,4), then RIGHT to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4) to eat the apple. This path is clear and safe.\n\nTherefore, choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

UP: (5,5) - Within board. Not your body (your body is at (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)). Not enemy body (enemy body is at (2,8), (1,8), etc.). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (5,3) - This is your own body (third segment). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (4,4) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (6,4) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving UP to (5,5): Moves you north. This gets you closer to the apples at (0,9) and (9,8). However, the enemy is at (3,8) which is north-west. From (5,5), you can go LEFT to (4,5) or RIGHT to (6,5) to approach the northern apples. But note the enemy body barrier at x=2 (from y=4 to y=8) blocks direct access to (0,9). To reach (0,9), you'd need to go around via y=9, which is risky due to enemy proximity.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,4): Moves you east towards the apple at (8,4). This is a clear path: from (6,4), you can continue RIGHT to (7,4), then (8,4) to eat the apple in 2 moves. This is efficient and safe.\n\nEnemy analysis: Enemy head is at (3,8). It can move UP to (3,9), DOWN to (3,7), LEFT to (2,8) (its body, unsafe), or RIGHT to (4,8). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. It might go UP to (3,9) to get closer to (0,9) or (9,8), or RIGHT to (4,8) to explore. It is not directly threatening you.\n\nGiven that you have 4 apples vs enemy 7, you need to catch up quickly. The closest apple is (8,4) which is 2 moves away via RIGHT. The apples at (0,3) and (0,0) are blocked by the enemy body barrier at x=2. The apples at (0,9) and (9,8) are far and the enemy is heading that way.\n\nTherefore, the best option is to go for (8,4) via RIGHT. This is safe and efficient.\n\nPlan for next turns: Move RIGHT to (6,4), then RIGHT to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4) to eat the apple. This path is clear and safe.\n\nNote: After eating (8,4), you can consider heading north towards (9,8) or south to avoid the enemy. But for now, focus on the immediate apple.\n\nTherefore, choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Apple (8, 4) is near enemy (6, 4) \u2014 enemy may go RIGHT to (7, 4) or DOWN/UP.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (5, 8), I can next turn go UP to (5, 9) and then move left along top toward (0, 9), or go DOWN toward middle.  \nIf I go DOWN now to (4, 7), I can later go left toward (0, 3) or right toward (8, 4) but risk enemy interference.  \n\nEnemy is shorter and may be heading toward (8, 4) or (0, 3). I should avoid head-on risk but also not trap myself.  \n\nRIGHT keeps me near top apples and gives flexibility. DOWN moves me toward center but away from (0, 9) and (9, 8).  \n\nGiven my last move rationale aimed at reaching (0, 9) via top row, RIGHT fits that plan better than DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (5, 8), consider UP next turn to (5, 9), then move left along top row toward (0, 9). Monitor enemy movement toward (8, 4) \u2014 if enemy moves toward it, I can consider going for (9, 8) instead.  \n\nRIGHT",

UP: (7,5) - Within board. Check: not your body (your body is at (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)). Not enemy body (enemy body is at (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6)). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (7,3) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n3. LEFT: (6,4) - This is your own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (8,4) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. However, there is an apple at (8,4). So moving here will eat the apple and grow.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,4): This immediately eats the apple at (8,4). This is highly beneficial: you gain an apple (now 5 vs enemy 7) and grow to length 6. After eating, your head will be at (8,4) and your body will extend: the new body will be [(8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)]. This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving UP to (7,5): This moves you north, away from the immediate apple. It might be useful for future apples (like (9,8)) but is less direct.\n- Moving DOWN to (7,3): Moves you south, away from the apple and towards the bottom apples (0,3) and (0,0), but these are blocked by the enemy body barrier at x=2.\n\nEnemy analysis: Enemy head is at (5,8). It can move UP to (5,9), DOWN to (5,7), LEFT to (4,8) (its body, unsafe), or RIGHT to (6,8). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. It might go UP to (5,9) to get closer to (0,9) or (9,8), or RIGHT to (6,8). It is not directly threatening you at (7,4).\n\nGiven that you have 4 apples vs enemy 7, you need to catch up quickly. The closest apple is (8,4) which is 1 move away via RIGHT. This is the best immediate move.\n\nAfter eating (8,4), you will be at (8,4) with length 6. From there, you can consider:\n- UP to (8,5) to head towards (9,8)\n- DOWN to (8,3) to head towards (0,3) and (0,0)\n- LEFT to (7,4) (but that is your body, so not safe) - so only UP and DOWN would be safe from (8,4) after eating.\n\nSo after this move, you will have two safe options (UP and DOWN). This is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nPlan for next turns: After eating (8,4), move UP to (8,5) to head towards (9,8) or DOWN to (8,3) to head south. Avoid going left into your body. The enemy is far away, so you have time to plan.\n\nRIGHT",

It might be useful for future apples (like (0,3) and (0,0)), but these are far and the enemy is blocking the left side.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,4): Moves you east, which is safe but doesn't eat an apple.

UP: (8,6) - Within board. Check: not your body (your body is at (8,4), etc.). Not enemy body (enemy body is at (6,8), etc.). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (8,4) - This is your own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (7,5) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (9,5) - Within board (x=9 is valid). Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving UP to (8,6): Moves you north. This is towards the apple at (0,9) and (9,8). However, (0,9) is far and (9,8) is closer. From (8,6), you can later go to (8,7) or (9,6) to approach (9,8).\n- Moving LEFT to (7,5): Moves you west. This is away from the apples (which are mostly on the left and top edges). There are no immediate apples nearby. This might be safe but not productive.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,5): Moves you east. This is towards the edge. There are no apples to the right. This is safe but not helpful.\n\nEnemy analysis: Enemy head is at (7,8). It can move UP to (7,9), DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8) (its body, unsafe), or RIGHT to (8,8). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. It might go UP to (7,9) to get closer to (0,9) or (9,8), or RIGHT to (8,8). It is not directly threatening you at (8,5).\n\nLong-term strategy: You have 6 apples vs enemy 7. You need to catch up. The closest apples are (9,8) and (0,9). (9,8) is at (9,8) - which is 3 moves away (e.g., UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), then UP to (9,8)? Actually, from (8,5), to get to (9,8): you need to go RIGHT and UP. Alternatively, (0,9) is far and the enemy is blocking the left side.\n\nBest immediate move: UP to (8,6) to start heading towards (9,8). This is the most direct route to the nearest apple. From (8,6), you can then consider RIGHT to (9,6) or UP to (8,7) next turn.\n\nAfter moving UP to (8,6), your head will be at (8,6) and your body will be [(8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)] (length 8, same as enemy).\n\nThis move keeps you safe and progresses towards an apple.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving UP to (8,6), aim to go RIGHT to (9,6) and then UP to (9,7) and (9,8) to eat the apple at (9,8). Avoid going left into the enemy's territory. The enemy might also be heading for (9,8), so be cautious of head-on collisions. However, you are closer to (9,8) than the enemy (enemy at (7,8) is 2 moves away: RIGHT to (8,8) and UP to (8,9) or RIGHT to (9,8)? Actually, from (7,8), it can go RIGHT to (8,8) and then RIGHT to (9,8) in two moves. So you are both equally close? You are at (8,5) to (9,8) is 3 moves (e.g., UP, RIGHT, UP) while enemy is 2 moves (RIGHT, RIGHT). So enemy might get there first. But if you go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), then you are adjacent to (9,8). Alternatively, you could go directly RIGHT from (8,5) to (9,5) and then UP to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8) - but that is slower. So UP is better.\n\nGiven that enemy might get (9,8) first, but you can still try. Alternatively, consider going for (0,9) but that is risky due to enemy body barrier.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to start the journey towards (9,8).\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nYour snake (ID 1):\n- Head: (8,6)\n- Body: [(8,5), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)] (length 7 segments, 6 apples collected)\nApples at: (0,9), (9,8), (0,3), (0,0), (0,1)\n\nEnemy snake (ID 0):\n- Head: (8,8)\n- Body: [(7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)] (length 8 segments, 7 apples)\n\nPossible moves from your head (8,6):\n1. UP: (8,7) - Within board. Check: not your body (your body is at (8,5), etc.). Not enemy body (enemy body is at (7,8), etc.). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (8,5) - This is your own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (7,6) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (9,6) - Within board (x=9 is valid). Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving UP to (8,7): Moves you north. This is towards the apple at (9,8) and (0,9). From (8,7), you can later go to (8,8) or (9,7) to approach (9,8). However, (8,8) is currently occupied by the enemy head? Actually, enemy head is at (8,8) now. So moving to (8,8) would cause a head-on collision next turn if enemy stays? But we don't know enemy's move.\n- Moving LEFT to (7,6): Moves you west. This is away from the apples. There are no immediate apples nearby. This might be safe but not productive.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,6): Moves you east. This is towards the edge. From (9,6), you can go UP to (9,7) and then to (9,8) to eat the apple. This seems direct.\n\nEnemy analysis: Enemy head is at (8,8). It can move UP to (8,9), DOWN to (8,7), LEFT to (7,8) (its body, unsafe), or RIGHT to (9,8). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. It might go DOWN to (8,7) to get closer to you, or RIGHT to (9,8) to eat the apple, or UP to (8,9). Note that (9,8) is an apple, so enemy is likely to go RIGHT to (9,8) to eat it. If enemy goes RIGHT to (9,8), it will eat the apple and grow.\n\nIf you move UP to (8,7), you are adjacent to enemy head (8,8). If enemy moves DOWN to (8,7), you collide and both die. That is risky.\n\nIf you move RIGHT to (9,6), you are moving towards (9,8) but enemy might get there first. However, if enemy goes RIGHT to (9,8), it will be at (9,8) and you at (9,6). Then you can go UP to (9,7) and then to (9,8) but enemy is already there? Actually, after enemy eats the apple, it will grow and its tail will extend. So (9,8) might be occupied by enemy body next turn.\n\nAlternatively, consider going for other apples: (0,9) is far and enemy controls left side. (0,3), (0,0), (0,1) are on the left edge.\n\nBest immediate move: RIGHT to (9,6). This avoids the enemy head (8,8) and moves directly towards the apple at (9,8). Even if enemy eats (9,8) first, you can then consider other options. But moving UP to (8,7) is too risky due to potential enemy DOWN move.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (9,6), your head will be at (9,6) and your body will be [(9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)] (length 8, same as enemy).\n\nThis move keeps you safe and progresses towards the apple at (9,8).\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving RIGHT to (9,6), aim to go UP to (9,7) and then to (9,8) if the enemy hasn't taken it. If enemy has taken (9,8), you can go LEFT to (8,7) or DOWN to (9,5) to avoid collision and seek other apples.\n\nLong-term: You have 6 apples vs enemy 7. You need to catch up. The apple at (9,8) is key. Also, consider the apples on the left (0,9), (0,3), (0,0), (0,1) but they are risky due to enemy presence.\n\nRIGHT",

Actually, let\u2019s check: current body length 7 segments after head, total 8. Eating apple means tail doesn\u2019t move, so new segment added at tail end: tail stays at (1, 8) one more turn, body becomes 8 segments after head, total length 9.  \n\nFrom (9, 8):  \nUP \u2192 (9, 9) empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9, 7) empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8, 8) my body \u2192 suicide.  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 suicide.  \nOnly 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN).

Avoid UP now because it delays apple and restricts next moves more.  \n\nRIGHT is best: immediate apple, safe from head-on, enemy not in position to block exit from corner next turn.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

But if enemy goes UP, we both die.  \nFrom (9, 7) if alive:  \nUP \u2192 (9, 8) my body \u2192 suicide.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9, 6) enemy\u2019s head current position \u2014 but enemy will move, so next turn (9, 6) could be empty or enemy body. Actually enemy\u2019s body after moving from (9, 6) will leave (9, 6) empty unless it goes LEFT? Let\u2019s check: enemy\u2019s possible moves UP \u2192 (9, 7), DOWN \u2192 (9, 5). So (9, 6) becomes its body segment (old head) if it moves UP or DOWN. So (9, 6) will be enemy body next turn.

Need to navigate toward apples on left side (0, 9), (0, 3), etc., while keeping distance from enemy.

Actually, it has 8 body segments including head? Wait: head at (9,8) and body has 8 segments? Actually, it collected 8 apples so it should have length 9 (head + 8 body segments). But the body list has 8 tuples: [(8,8), (7,8), ... (1,8)] so total segments = head + 8 = 9. So enemy length is 9.\n\nPossible moves from your head (9,6):\n1. UP: (9,7) - Within board. Check: not your body (your body is at (8,6), etc.). Not enemy body (enemy body is along y=8 from x=8 to x=1). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (9,5) - Within board. Not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n3. LEFT: (8,6) - This is your own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: Not possible, x=9 is max, so moving right would go to (10,6) which is off-board. Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- Moving UP to (9,7): This moves you closer to the apple at (9,8)? Actually, apple at (9,8) is not listed? Wait, apples are at (0,9), (0,3), (0,0), (0,1), (2,7). There is no apple at (9,8). But the enemy head is at (9,8). So moving UP to (9,7) brings you adjacent to enemy head.\n- Moving DOWN to (9,5): Moves you away from enemy.\n\nEnemy analysis: Enemy head at (9,8). It can move UP to (9,9) - within board, safe? Check: (9,9) is not enemy body (enemy body is along x=8 to x=1 at y=8). Not your body. Safe.\nDOWN to (9,7) - safe? (9,7) is not enemy body, not your body? Your head is at (9,6) so (9,7) is free. Safe.\nLEFT to (8,8) - this is its own body (second segment). Unsafe.\nRIGHT: off-board. Unsafe.\nSo enemy safe moves: UP to (9,9) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nThe enemy might go DOWN to (9,7) to potentially attack you? Or UP to (9,9) to explore.\n\nIf you move UP to (9,7), and enemy moves DOWN to (9,7), you have a head-on collision and both die. That is very risky.\nIf you move UP and enemy moves UP to (9,9), you are safe at (9,7).\n\nIf you move DOWN to (9,5), you are safe regardless.\n\nGiven the risk, moving UP is dangerous because enemy might choose DOWN. Since enemy has more apples (8 vs your 6), it might be aggressive to eliminate you? Or it might go for apples.\n\nApples: The closest apple to you is at (2,7). Others are on left edge: (0,9), (0,3), (0,0), (0,1). (0,9) is near enemy territory.\n\nLong-term plan: You need to avoid the enemy and collect apples. Moving DOWN to (9,5) is safe and opens options to go left or down next. From (9,5), you can go LEFT to (8,5) (but your body is at (8,5)? Actually, your body has (8,5) as third segment? Wait, your body: [(8,6), (8,5), (8,4), ...]. So (8,5) is occupied. So from (9,5), safe moves would be UP (to (9,6) but that is your head? No, head moves), DOWN (to (9,4)), LEFT (to (8,5) which is body). So only DOWN is safe? That might lead to a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,7) is risky but if enemy moves UP, you can then go LEFT to (8,7) or RIGHT? But right is off. So from (9,7), safe moves would be DOWN (back to (9,6)), LEFT (to (8,7)), or UP (to (9,8) but enemy is there). So if enemy is at (9,8), you cannot go UP.\n\nBest move: DOWN to (9,5). This avoids immediate risk. Then next turn, from (9,5), you can go DOWN to (9,4) (which is free? Check: your body has (8,4) and (7,4), etc., but (9,4) is free). So DOWN to (9,4) is safe. Then you can continue down to (9,3), (9,2), etc., to approach the bottom apples like (0,0), (0,1), (0,3). This is a long route but safe.\n\nAlternatively, if you move UP and enemy moves UP, you can then go LEFT to (8,7) and then down to (8,6) etc., but that might loop.\n\nGiven the high risk of head-on collision if you move UP, and since enemy has more to lose (8 apples vs your 6), it might avoid DOWN to (9,7) to avoid collision? But we cannot assume.\n\nTo be safe, choose DOWN.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (9,5), go DOWN to (9,4) and then continue along the right edge to bottom to collect apples on left bottom.

Let\u2019s simulate: current body length 9, no apple eaten, so tail (2,8) disappears. New body: head (8,9), then (9,9),(9,8),(8,8),(7,8),(6,8),(5,8),(4,8),(3,8). So (9,9) becomes my neck, so RIGHT to (9,9) is my body \u2192 suicide.  \nThus from (8,9) next turn, only safe move is LEFT to (7,9).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nI\u2019m forced LEFT to (8,9) now, then forced LEFT to (7,9) next turn.

Let\u2019s check: after next turn (head (8,9), body as above), (7,8) is my 4th segment \u2014 still occupied. So from (7,9) next turn, DOWN to (7,8) is body \u2192 suicide.

Enemy is moving down, so no immediate threat. Once my tail (currently at (2,8)) moves, cells below me (y=8) will free up, allowing me to go DOWN later. Plan: keep moving left along top row toward apple (0,9), but watch for when (x,8) below me becomes free \u2014 then go DOWN to get off top row and gain more mobility. Avoid moving into (0,9) if it leaves no exit; maybe eat it from the side (from (0,8) if possible).  \n\n**Final move:**  \nLEFT",

UP: (9,6) - This is your own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n2. DOWN: (9,4) - Within board. Check: not your body (your body has (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) - all at x=8,7,6). Not enemy body (enemy is at y=8). Safe.\n3. LEFT: (8,5) - This is your own body (fourth segment). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: Not possible, x=9 is max. Unsafe.\n\nSo only safe move: DOWN to (9,4).\n\nNow, we must consider what the enemy might do. Enemy head at (9,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: off-board (y=10) -> unsafe.\n- DOWN: (9,8) -> its own body (second segment) -> unsafe.\n- LEFT: (8,9) -> within board. Check: not enemy body (all enemy body is at y=8). Not your body (your body is at lower y). Safe.\n- RIGHT: off-board -> unsafe.\nSo enemy only safe move: LEFT to (8,9).\n\nTherefore, enemy will move to (8,9) this turn. There is no risk of head-on collision or other immediate threat from enemy.\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (9,4), your head will be at (9,4). From there, next turn you can consider:\n- UP: (9,5) -> but that will be your neck? Actually, after moving, your body becomes [head at (9,4), then (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), ...].

This is acceptable because there are apples at the bottom (0,0), (0,1), (0,3). You can plan to go down to (9,0) and then left to collect them.\n\nLong-term plan: Move down along the right edge (x=9) to (9,0). Then move left along the bottom to collect apples at (0,0), (0,1), (0,3). Avoid enemy territory (enemy is on top and left). The apple at (2,7) is near enemy, so avoid for now. The apple at (0,9) is also near enemy head, so avoid.\n\nSince only one move is safe, we must choose DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

UP: (9,4) - This is your own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n2. DOWN: (9,2) - Within board. Check: not your body (your body is at y>=4). Not enemy body (enemy is at y=8 and 9). Safe.\n3. LEFT: (8,3) - Within board. Check: not your body (your body has x=8 and y>=4, or x=9). Not enemy body (enemy is at x<=9, y=8-9). Safe.\n4. RIGHT: Off-board (x=10). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake head at (7,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (7,10) -> off-board, unsafe.\n- DOWN: (7,8) -> its own body (fifth segment), unsafe.\n- LEFT: (6,9) -> within board. Check: not enemy body (all enemy body has y=8 or 9, x>=4). Not your body (your body is at lower y). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,9) -> its own body (second segment), unsafe.\nSo enemy only safe move: LEFT to (6,9).\n\nTherefore, enemy will move to (6,9) this turn. There is no immediate threat of collision with you.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving down along the right edge to (9,0). Then move left along the bottom to collect apples at (0,0), (0,1), (0,3). Avoid the enemy which is on the top-left. The apple at (2,7) is near enemy, so avoid. The apple at (0,9) is also near enemy head. Since enemy has more apples (8 vs your 6), you need to collect multiple apples quickly to catch up. The bottom row has three apples, so prioritize that path.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT:\n- DOWN: (9,2) - moves you closer to the bottom apples. Next moves from there: DOWN to (9,1), LEFT to (8,2), RIGHT off-board. So only DOWN and LEFT safe next turn? Actually, after moving DOWN, your head is at (9,2), and your body will be [(9,3), (9,4), ...]. So next turn:\n  - UP: (9,3) -> your body (current head becomes second segment) -> unsafe.\n  - DOWN: (9,1) -> free.\n  - LEFT: (8,2) -> free.\n  - RIGHT: off-board -> unsafe.\nSo two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n- LEFT: (8,3) - moves you away from the bottom apples. Next moves from (8,3): \n  - UP: (8,4) -> your body (last segment) -> unsafe.\n  - DOWN: (8,2) -> free.\n  - LEFT: (7,3) -> free.\n  - RIGHT: (9,3) -> your body (current head becomes second segment) -> unsafe.\nSo two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nBoth moves give two safe options next turn. However, DOWN progresses directly toward the bottom apples (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), which are your primary target. LEFT moves you horizontally, which is less efficient for reaching the bottom.\n\nTherefore, prefer DOWN to get closer to the apples.\n\nDOWN",

UP: (9,2) - This is your own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n2. DOWN: (9,0) - Within board. Check: not your body (your body has y>=2). Not enemy body (enemy is at y>=8). Safe.\n3. LEFT: (8,1) - Within board. Check: not your body (your body has x=8 only at y=6, and x=9 for y>=2). Not enemy body (enemy is at x>=5, y>=8). Safe.\n4. RIGHT: Off-board (x=10). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake head at (5,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (5,10) -> off-board, unsafe.\n- DOWN: (5,8) -> within board. Check: not enemy body (enemy body has y=8 or 9, x>=6). Not your body (your body is at lower y). Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,9) -> within board. Check: not enemy body (enemy body has x>=5). Not your body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,9) -> its own body (second segment), unsafe.\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN to (5,8) and LEFT to (4,9).\n\nThe enemy has two options, so we cannot predict exactly where it will go. However, both moves are away from your path.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving down to (9,0) to start collecting the apples along the bottom row: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3). Avoid the enemy which is on the top-left. The apple at (2,7) is near enemy, and (0,9) is also near enemy head. Since enemy has more apples (8 vs your 6), you need to collect multiple apples quickly to catch up. The bottom row has three apples, so prioritize that path.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT:\n- DOWN: (9,0) - moves you to the bottom-right corner. This is directly on the path to the apples. Next moves from (9,0): \n  - UP: (9,1) -> your body (current head becomes second segment) -> unsafe.\n  - DOWN: off-board -> unsafe.\n  - LEFT: (8,0) -> free.\n  - RIGHT: off-board -> unsafe.\nSo only LEFT is safe next turn. This is a bit limiting, but it forces you along the bottom row.\n\n- LEFT: (8,1) - moves you away from the bottom apples. Next moves from (8,1):\n  - UP: (8,2) -> free (your body is at y>=2, x=9 and (8,6)).\n  - DOWN: (8,0) -> free.\n  - LEFT: (7,1) -> free.\n  - RIGHT: (9,1) -> your body (current head becomes second segment) -> unsafe.\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLEFT gives more options next turn, but DOWN progresses you toward the apples faster. Since you need to catch up in apples, efficiency is key. Going DOWN to (9,0) is safe and sets you up to move left along the bottom to collect (0,0), (0,1), and (0,3). The enemy is unlikely to interfere as it is far away.\n\nTherefore, prefer DOWN to get closer to the apples.\n\nDOWN",

This could be less efficient.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving left along the bottom row (x=7,6,5,...0) to collect the apples at (0,0), (0,1), (0,3). This is safe and efficient. The enemy is on the top and might be going for (0,9) or (2,7), but you have a clear path to multiple apples. After collecting these, you can consider moving up to (0,4) etc. to avoid trapping yourself.\n\nTherefore, move LEFT to (7,0) to progress toward the apples.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, check: body is [(4,9),(5,9),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(9,9),(9,8),(8,8)], tail at (8,8). If I move to (4,7) without eating apple, tail stays at (8,8) and head moves, so body becomes [(4,7),(4,9),(5,9),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(9,9),(9,8)]? Actually, snake moves: head to new cell, each segment shifts forward, tail cell vacated unless apple eaten. So new body: [(4,7),(4,9),(5,9),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(9,9),(9,8)]. Then (4,8) is empty. So UP to (4,8) is safe. DOWN to (4,6) safe. LEFT to (3,7) safe. RIGHT to (5,7) safe. All 4 directions safe next turn if no apple. Good.  \n\n- **LEFT to (3,8):**  \n  Next turn from (3,8): body becomes [(3,8),(4,9),(5,9),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(9,9),(9,8)].  \n  UP \u2192 (3,9) empty.  \n  DOWN \u2192 (3,7) empty.  \n  LEFT \u2192 (2,8) empty.  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (4,8) empty (since old head at (4,8) is now gone).  \n  All 4 safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (5,8):**  \n  Next turn from (5,8): body becomes [(5,8),(4,9),(5,9),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(9,9),(9,8)].  \n  UP \u2192 (5,9) my body (second segment) \u2192 suicide.  \n  DOWN \u2192 (5,7) empty.  \n  LEFT \u2192 (4,8) empty.  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (6,8) empty.  \n  3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nSo DOWN and LEFT give 4 safe follow-ups, RIGHT gives 3.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple path planning:**  \nClosest apple is (2,7) at distance |4-2|+|8-7|=3 steps.  \nFrom (4,8):  \n- DOWN to (4,7) \u2192 distance to (2,7) = 2 steps.  \n- LEFT to (3,8) \u2192 distance to (2,7) = 2 steps.  \n- RIGHT to (5,8) \u2192 distance to (2,7) = 4 steps.  \n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT equally closer to (2,7).  \nApple at (0,9) is 4 steps from (4,8), but enemy is far from it.  \nEnemy is moving toward bottom-left apples (0,0),(0,1). If I go DOWN, I\u2019m closer to (2,7) and can then go LEFT/DOWN to get it next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning:**  \nGoing DOWN keeps me more central, avoids top row where my body blocks some moves later. LEFT moves me toward left wall, which could limit options later but gets me closer to left-side apples.  \n\nGiven both DOWN and LEFT give 4 follow-up moves and equal distance to nearest apple, I prefer DOWN because it opens more of the board and keeps distance from enemy\u2019s possible path toward (0,0).  \n\n**Strategy note for next turns:**  \nFrom (4,7), consider moving toward (2,7) apple via LEFT then DOWN or DOWN then LEFT. Monitor enemy: if enemy goes UP to (8,1), they may head toward (2,7) too. If they go LEFT to (7,0), they\u2019ll aim for bottom apples. Keep options open; maybe loop up toward (0,9) later if enemy is low.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

Moving LEFT to (5,0) progresses you directly toward these apples efficiently. Moving UP to (6,1) is safe but doesn't advance you toward the apples as directly. It might lead to a dead-end or require navigating around your body which is along the right column (x=9). This could be less efficient and riskier in the long run.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (5,0), next turn you can:\n- UP: (5,1) - free\n- LEFT: (4,0) - free\n- DOWN: off-board - unsafe\n- RIGHT: (6,0) - your body (current head becomes second segment) - unsafe\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT. This keeps you on the path to the left.\n\nThe enemy is going for (2,7) or other apples, but you have a clear path to multiple apples. Continue left to collect (0,0), (0,1), (0,3) first. Then consider moving up to avoid trapping yourself.\n\nTherefore, move LEFT to (5,0) to progress toward the apples.\n\nLEFT",

So 3 safe follow-ups.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple path planning:**  \nClosest apple is (2,7) at distance 1 step. LEFT eats it immediately.  \nOther apples: (0,9) distance from (3,7) = |3-0|+|7-9|=3+2=5 steps.  \n(0,3) distance = |3-0|+|7-3|=3+4=7 steps.  \n(0,0) and (0,1) are far.  \n\nEating (2,7) now gives me 9 apples vs enemy\u2019s 6, extending lead.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning:**  \nEating apple at (2,7) puts me closer to left-side apples (0,3),(0,1),(0,0) and also (0,9) upward. Enemy is moving toward bottom-left apples from (6,0). After eating, I\u2019ll be at (2,7) with length 10. Next turn I can go LEFT to (1,7) or DOWN/UP to maneuver toward other apples while keeping distance from enemy.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk of trapping:**  \nLEFT eats apple but reduces future safe moves to 3 next turn. DOWN gives 4 safe follow-ups and keeps apple (2,7) reachable later. However, enemy could move toward (0,3) or (0,1) soon. Securing (2,7) now denies it to enemy and increases my lead.  \n\nGiven enemy is far away at (6,0), immediate apple grab is safe.  \n\n**Strategy note for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (2,7), consider moving LEFT to (1,7) then DOWN toward (0,3) or UP toward (0,9) depending on enemy position. Enemy likely heading left along bottom row; if they go to (5,0) then (4,0), they\u2019ll be closer to (0,0)-(0,3) apples. I can aim for (0,9) next if enemy blocks bottom-left path. Keep checking enemy\u2019s possible moves to avoid head-on collisions.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nLEFT",

Its possible moves:\n- UP: (2,9) - Free (not enemy body, enemy body is at (2,7) and below).\n- DOWN: (2,7) - Its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,8) - Free.\n- RIGHT: (3,8) - Free? Enemy body is at (3,7) and (4,7) etc. (3,8) is not listed in enemy body (enemy body: (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8), ...). So (3,8) is free.\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is far away (top-left) and not an immediate threat. Your primary targets are the apples on the left: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3). Moving LEFT to (3,0) progresses you directly toward these apples. Moving UP to (4,1) is safe but doesn't advance you toward the apples as efficiently. It might lead to a longer path.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (3,0), next turn you can:\n- UP: (3,1) - free\n- LEFT: (2,0) - free\n- DOWN: off-board - unsafe\n- RIGHT: (4,0) - your body (current head becomes second segment) - unsafe\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT. This continues the path to the left.\n\nThe enemy has 9 apples and is close to winning (30 apples to win). You need to collect apples quickly. The left column has three apples in a row: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3). Moving left is efficient.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (9,4) is near your tail. You might consider it later after collecting the left ones, but for now, left is better.\n\nTherefore, move LEFT to (3,0) to progress toward the apples.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving left to collect (0,0), (0,1), and (0,3). After that, consider moving up along the left wall to get (0,9) or possibly circle back to (9,4). Avoid the enemy snake which is in the top-left area.\n\nLEFT",

UP gives 2 safe moves, LEFT gives 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple path planning:**  \nClosest apple is (0,9) at distance |2-0|+|8-9| = 2+1 = 3 steps.  \n(0,3) is at distance |2-0|+|8-3| = 2+5 = 7 steps.  \n(9,4) is far.

LEFT to (1,8) keeps more options open and is still on track to (0,9).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoiding enemy and dead ends:**  \nEnemy is moving left/up from (4,0) toward bottom-left apples. They are far from (0,9) for now.  \nLEFT to (1,8) keeps me moving toward apple while maintaining flexibility to go up, down, or further left next turn.  \n\n**Strategy note for next turns:**  \nFrom (1,8), next turn go LEFT to (0,8) then UP to (0,9) to collect apple. Watch enemy\u2019s position\u2014if they suddenly head up the left column, I may need to divert to (9,4) later.

UP: (2,1) - Check: not your body (your body is at (3,0) and beyond). Not enemy body (enemy is at y>=7). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (2,-1) - Off-board. Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (1,0) - Within board. Check: not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (3,0) - This is your own body (the first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake head at (0,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (0,9) - There is an apple at (0,9). Also, enemy body is at (4,9) etc., so (0,9) is free.\n- DOWN: (0,7) - Free? Enemy body is at (2,7) and (3,7), so (0,7) is free.\n- LEFT: (-1,8) - Off-board. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,8) - Its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\nSo enemy safe moves: UP and DOWN. The enemy might go UP to (0,9) to eat the apple.\n\nYour primary targets are the apples on the left: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3). Moving LEFT to (1,0) progresses you directly toward these apples. Moving UP to (2,1) is safe but doesn't advance you toward the apples as efficiently.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (1,0), next turn you can:\n- UP: (1,1) - free\n- LEFT: (0,0) - apple! (and safe, since no snake body there)\n- DOWN: off-board - unsafe\n- RIGHT: (2,0) - your body (current head becomes second segment) - unsafe\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT. This continues the path to the left.\n\nThe enemy has 9 apples and is close to winning (30 apples to win). You need to collect apples quickly. The left column has three apples in a row: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3). Moving left is efficient.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (9,4) is near your tail. You might consider it later after collecting the left ones, but for now, left is better.\n\nTherefore, move LEFT to (1,0) to progress toward the apples.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving left to collect (0,0), (0,1), and (0,3). After that, consider moving up along the left wall to get (0,9) if still available. Avoid the enemy snake which is in the top-left area. The enemy might eat (0,9) this turn, so prioritize the lower apples first.\n\nLEFT",

Eating it now gets me to 10 apples.  \nEnemy is far away at bottom-left, heading toward (0,0),(0,1),(0,3). They are not threatening (0,9) this turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nUP to (0,9) eats apple but leaves me in a corner with only RIGHT safe next turn \u2013 potential trap if (1,9) becomes dangerous later.  \nDOWN to (0,7) avoids corner, keeps 2 safe moves next turn, but delays apple.  \n\nGiven I\u2019m ahead 9 vs 6, securing apple now is good, but being trapped at (0,9) with only RIGHT next turn is dangerous if enemy approaches top row later. However, enemy is far away at y=0/1, so I likely have time to escape after eating.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I eat apple at (0,9) now, next turn I must go RIGHT to (1,9). From there, I can go DOWN to (1,8) (which will be empty after I move) or RIGHT to (2,9) (empty) to avoid getting stuck. Avoid going back left into my long body. After eating, aim to circle toward central area or toward other apples on left column later.  \n\n**Final decision:**  \nEating apple now is beneficial and safe this turn. I\u2019ll take it and deal with corner escape next turn.  \n\nUP",

That\u2019s a dangerous corridor along the top row.  \nFrom (2,9) I\u2019ll have more options: DOWN to (2,8) (my body? check future positions) or RIGHT to (3,9) etc. Need to plan an escape from top row toward center or toward apples without trapping myself.  \n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nAt (1,9) \u2192 must go RIGHT to (2,9).  \nFrom (2,9):  \n- DOWN to (2,8) \u2014 will that be empty? After my move to (1,9), body: (0,9),(0,8),(1,8),(2,8)... yes (2,8) is my 5th segment, so occupied next turn \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT to (3,9) empty.  \n- UP off board \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT to (1,9) my previous head \u2192 suicide.  \nSo from (2,9) only safe is RIGHT to (3,9).  \n\nThis means I\u2019m stuck moving right along top row until I can go down safely.  \nCheck when (x,8) becomes free:  \nMy body segments after this move:  \n(0,9),(0,8),(1,8),(2,8),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7),(4,8),(4,9),(5,9),(6,9)  \nTail at (6,9) will move to (6,9)? Actually growth means tail stays, so tail remains (6,9) until next time I eat.  \nSo (3,8) is free now, but I can\u2019t reach it from top row without going through (2,8) or (3,9)\u2192(3,8).  \nFrom (3,9) next turn: DOWN to (3,8) free? Yes, (3,8) is empty now and will stay empty unless enemy moves there.  \nSo plan: This turn RIGHT to (1,9). Next turn RIGHT to (2,9). Turn after RIGHT to (3,9).

Check: there is an apple at (0,0)! Also, not your body (your body is at (2,0) etc.). Not enemy body (enemy is at y>=7). Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (2,0) - This is your own body (the first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow, LEFT leads directly to an apple at (0,0). This is highly beneficial as it gives you an apple and grows your snake. UP is safe but doesn't get an apple immediately.\n\nConsider enemy snake head at (0,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (0,10) - Off-board. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (0,8) - Its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (-1,9) - Off-board. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,9) - Free? Enemy body is at (1,8) and (4,9), so (1,9) is free. Also, there is no apple there.\nSo enemy safe moves: only RIGHT to (1,9). The enemy has no other options.\n\nTherefore, the enemy will move RIGHT to (1,9). This does not interfere with your moves at (0,0) or (1,1).\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,0) is optimal: you eat the apple, grow to 7 segments, and your new head will be at (0,0). Then your body becomes [(1,0), (2,0), ... (7,0)] plus a new tail segment (since you grew).\n\nAfter eating (0,0), you can then target (0,1) and (0,3) next. From (0,0), you can move UP to (0,1) (which has an apple) or possibly other directions. But note: after moving LEFT to (0,0), your next head is at (0,0). Then your body includes (1,0) which is directly behind. So next turn, moving RIGHT to (1,0) would be into your own body (unsafe). But moving UP to (0,1) is safe and gets an apple. So the plan is solid.\n\nUP is safe but doesn't get an apple. It might be useful if you wanted to avoid the left wall temporarily, but since the apples are there and safe, LEFT is better.\n\nTherefore, move LEFT to (0,0) to eat the apple.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (0,0), move UP to (0,1) to eat the next apple. Then continue to (0,3). Avoid the enemy which is moving to (1,9) and is trapped in the top-right. You can then consider moving to (1,4) or (9,4) later.

UP: (0,1) - Within board. There is an apple at (0,1)! Check safety: not your body (your body is at (1,0) and beyond). Not enemy body (enemy is at y>=7). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (0,-1) - Off-board. Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (-1,0) - Off-board. Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (1,0) - This is your own body (the first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe move is UP to (0,1), which also has an apple.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (1,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (1,10) - Off-board. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,8) - Its own body (third segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (0,9) - Its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (2,9) - Check: free? Enemy body is at (2,8) and (4,9), so (2,9) is free. Also, no apple there. So safe.\n\nTherefore, the enemy will move RIGHT to (2,9). This does not interfere with your move to (0,1).\n\nMoving UP to (0,1) is optimal: you eat the apple, grow to 8 segments, and your new head will be at (0,1). Then your body becomes [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), ... (7,0)] plus a new tail segment (since you grew).\n\nAfter eating (0,1), you can then target (0,3) next. From (0,1), you can move UP to (0,2) and then to (0,3) (which has an apple). Alternatively, you could consider moving right to (1,1) and then to (1,4) or (4,3), but the closest apple is (0,3).\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (0,1), move UP to (0,2) (safe, no apple) and then to (0,3) to eat that apple. Then you have 9 apples. Avoid the enemy which is moving to (2,9) and is trapped in the top-right. You can then consider moving to (1,4) or (4,3) or (9,4). The enemy has 10 apples and is long, but you are collecting quickly. Note that your tail is at (7,0) and moving leftwards, so you have space to maneuver along the bottom and left edges.\n\nUP",

Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,9) - Its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (3,9) - Check: within board. Enemy body is at (4,9) and (4,8), so (3,9) is free. Also no apple there.

Also, you can later go to (0,4) and (0,5). This path is along the left edge, which is relatively safe since the enemy is far away at the top.\n- RIGHT to (1,1): This moves you towards the apples at (1,4) and (4,3). From (1,1), you can go UP to (1,2) and then to (1,3) and (1,4). Alternatively, you can go RIGHT to (2,1) and then towards (4,3). However, this moves you into the center, which might be riskier in the long run.\n\nSince you have an apple very close at (0,3) (only 2 moves away), it is efficient to go for it. Also, your tail is at (7,0) and moving leftwards, so you have space to grow without trapping yourself.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (0,3), you'll have 9 apples. Then you can target (0,5) or (1,4). The enemy has 10 apples and is trapped in the top-right corner (it will move to (3,9) and then has limited options).

UP: (0,3) - Within board. Check: no apple? Actually (0,3) has an apple! So moving here would eat it. Also, not your body (your body is at y<=1). Not enemy body (enemy at y>=7). Safe and beneficial.\n2. DOWN: (0,1) - This is your own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (-1,2) - Off-board. Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (1,2) - Within board. Check: not your body (your body is at y=0). Not enemy body (enemy at y>=7). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (3,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (3,10) - Off-board. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (3,8) - Check: within board. Enemy body is at (4,8) and (2,8), so (3,8) is free. Also no apple there. Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,9) - Its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (4,9) - Check: within board. Enemy body is at (4,8) and (4,7), so (4,9) is free. Also no apple there. Safe.\n\nTherefore, the enemy can move DOWN to (3,8) or RIGHT to (4,9). Both are safe and don't directly threaten you.\n\nNow, evaluate your safe moves:\n- UP to (0,3): This immediately eats the apple. You will grow by one segment (new tail at the end). This gives you 9 apples. After eating, your head will be at (0,3) and your body will extend to include (0,3) as head, then (0,2), (0,1), etc. This is highly advantageous.\n- RIGHT to (1,2): This moves you away from the immediate apple but towards other apples (like (1,4) or (4,3)). However, it doesn't provide immediate benefit.\n\nEating the apple at (0,3) is the best move because:\n- It increases your score to 9 (closer to the enemy's 10).\n- It is safe and efficient.\n- After eating, you can consider moving to (0,4) and then (0,5) (another apple) or to (1,3) and then (1,4). This keeps you along the left edge, which is relatively safe.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (0,3), target (0,5) next (two moves away). Then consider (1,4) or (4,3). The enemy is trapped in the top-right and may struggle to get apples. You can continue to dominate the left side and bottom. Avoid moving into the center until necessary to prevent head-on collisions.\n\nChoose UP to eat the apple at (0,3).\n\nUP",

Wait, note: you had 9 apples collected (so length should be 10 segments including head). But from the initial state: you had 9 apples and body length 9 segments? Actually, initial body had 9 segments (head + 8 body) so total length 9. After eating one apple, you grow by one, so now length should be 10. But the board state shows:\n  - Your head at (0,3) and body segments: (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0) \u2014 that is 9 body segments? Actually, the list has 9 tuples after head? Wait, let's count: head (0,3) and then 9 body segments? That would be total length 10. Correct.\n\nApples at: (9,4), (1,4), (4,3), (0,5), (7,1)   [Note: the apple at (0,3) was eaten]\n\nEnemy snake (ID 0):\n- Head: (3,8)   [from the board state]\n- Body: [(3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7)] \u2014 length 10 segments? Actually, it has 10 apples so length should be 11? Wait, initial: enemy had 10 apples, so body length 10 segments + head = 11. But the list has 10 tuples? Actually, the body list is given as 10 segments? That would be total length 11. Correct.\n\nNow, your head is at (0,3). Possible moves:\n1. UP: (0,4) \u2014 within board. Check: no apple? (apples are at (9,4), (1,4), etc. \u2014 (0,4) has no apple). Not your body (your body is at y<=3 and x=0 only up to (0,3) is head, then (0,2), etc. \u2014 so (0,4) is free). Not enemy body (enemy at y>=7). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (0,2) \u2014 this is your own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (-1,3) \u2014 off-board. Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (1,3) \u2014 within board. Check: not your body (your body is at x=0 for y<=3, and x>=1 only at y=0). Not enemy body (enemy at y>=7). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (3,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (3,9) \u2014 its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (3,7) \u2014 its own body (last segment? Actually, (3,7) is in its body list). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (2,8) \u2014 its own body (in the list: (2,8) is the 7th segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (4,8) \u2014 within board. Check: enemy body? Its body has (4,7) but not (4,8). Also no apple. Safe? But wait, is (4,8) free? From the board state, it is empty. So enemy can only move RIGHT to (4,8).\n\nTherefore, the enemy will move RIGHT to (4,8). This moves it away from you.\n\nNow, evaluate your safe moves:\n- UP to (0,4): This moves you towards the apple at (0,5) (two moves away). Also, it keeps you along the left edge which is relatively safe. After (0,4), you can go to (0,5) to eat the apple.\n- RIGHT to (1,3): This moves you towards the center. From (1,3), you can go to (1,4) (apple) or (2,3) etc. However, it might be riskier as you move away from the safe edge.\n\nLong-term plan: You have an apple at (0,5) very close. Also, (1,4) is nearby. Your strategy should be to collect these apples quickly to catch up to the enemy (you have 9, enemy has 10). After (0,5), you can consider (1,4) or (4,3). The enemy is trapped in the top-right and is moving right to (4,8). It might be heading towards the apple at (9,4) but that is far. You have an opportunity to collect multiple apples quickly.\n\nMoving UP to (0,4) is better because:\n- It directly sets you up for (0,5) next turn.\n- It keeps you along the safe left wall.\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,3) is also safe, but it doesn't lead to an apple as directly (the next move to (1,4) would eat the apple, but that is the same distance as (0,5) from (0,4)). However, (1,4) might be riskier because it is more central.\n\nTherefore, choose UP to (0,4) to target the apple at (0,5).\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving to (0,4), next turn go UP to (0,5) to eat the apple. Then consider moving to (1,5) or (0,6) to avoid backtracking into your body. Alternatively, if safe, go to (1,4) after (0,5). But prioritize safety.\n\nUP",

UP: (0,5) - within board. Check: apple present (0,5) -> you will eat it and grow. Not your body (your body is at y<=4 and x=0). Not enemy body (enemy at y>=7). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (0,3) - your own body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (-1,4) - off-board. Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (1,4) - within board. Check: apple present (1,4) -> you will eat it and grow. Not your body (your body is at y=0 for x>=1, and y<=3 at x=0). Not enemy body (enemy at y>=7). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT. Both lead to an apple.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (4,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (4,9) - within board. Check: not enemy body (enemy body has (3,9) but not (4,9)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,7) - enemy body (last segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (3,8) - enemy body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (5,8) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP to (4,9) or RIGHT to (5,8). Both are safe.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- You have two apples very close: (0,5) and (1,4). Eating either will bring you to 10 apples, tying the enemy.\n- After eating (0,5), you can consider moving to (0,6) or (1,5) to avoid backtracking. Alternatively, after eating (1,4), you can go to (1,5) or (2,4) or back to (0,4) (but (0,4) is your body next turn).\n- The enemy is in the top-right and might be heading towards (9,4). You have a chance to collect multiple apples quickly.\n\nWhich move is better?\n- UP to (0,5): Eats the apple. Then next turn, you can go UP to (0,6) or RIGHT to (1,5). Both should be safe (check next: (0,6) is free, (1,5) is free). This keeps you along the left edge which is safe.\n- RIGHT to (1,4): Eats the apple. Then next turn, you can go UP to (1,5), DOWN to (1,3) (but (1,3) is free? Actually, your body is at (0,3) and (0,2) etc., so (1,3) is free), or RIGHT to (2,4). However, moving to (1,3) might be risky if you have no escape later.\n\nBoth are good, but UP to (0,5) is slightly better because:\n- It keeps you on the edge, which is safer and gives you more options to move up or right.\n- After eating (0,5), you can easily access (1,5) or (0,6), and then the apple at (4,3) or (7,1).\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,4) brings you more into the center, which might be riskier if the enemy comes down.\n\nTherefore, choose UP to (0,5) to eat the apple and tie the score.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nAfter eating (0,5), go to (0,6) if safe (to avoid backtracking) or (1,5). Then target (1,4) if still available or (4,3). Avoid moving into areas where the enemy might come down.\n\nUP",

UP: (0,6) - within board. Check: not your body (your body is at y<=5 and x=0, and y=0 for x>=1). Not enemy body (enemy at y>=7). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (0,4) - your own body (first segment after head).

Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (5,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (5,9) - within board. Check: not enemy body (enemy body has (3,9) and (2,9) but not (5,9)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,7) - within board. Check: not enemy body (enemy body has (2,7) but not (5,7)). Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,8) - enemy body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (6,8) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP to (5,9), DOWN to (5,7), or RIGHT to (6,8). All are safe.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- You just ate an apple and tied the score at 10. Now you need to collect more apples safely.\n- Apples available: (1,4) is very close, (4,3) is also reachable, and (7,1) and (7,5) are farther.\n- Moving UP to (0,6) keeps you along the left edge, which is safe but might lead to a dead-end if you go too high (since enemy is above). From (0,6), you can go RIGHT to (1,6) or continue UP to (0,7), etc.\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,5) brings you closer to (1,4) and (4,3). From (1,5), you can go DOWN to (1,4) to eat the apple, or RIGHT to (2,5), or UP to (1,6).\n- The enemy is at (5,8) and might be heading towards (9,4) or other apples. You should avoid moving directly into its path.\n\nWhich move is better?\n- UP to (0,6): This is safe and gives you options to go RIGHT to (1,6) or UP to (0,7) next turn. However, moving up might not be optimal because there are no apples directly above (except possibly later) and you might get trapped near the top.\n- RIGHT to (1,5): This moves you towards the center and closer to the apple at (1,4). Next turn, you can go DOWN to (1,4) to eat the apple, which would bring you to 11 apples and lead the game. Alternatively, you can go RIGHT to (2,5) or UP to (1,6). This seems more proactive.\n\nAfter eating (1,4), you would have 11 apples and the enemy has 10. Then you can plan to go to (2,4) or (1,3) (but (1,3) is free) and then towards (4,3).\n\nTherefore, RIGHT to (1,5) is better because it directly sets you up to eat (1,4) next turn and take the lead.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nAfter moving to (1,5), next turn go DOWN to (1,4) to eat the apple (if safe). Then consider moving to (2,4) or (1,3) to avoid backtracking. Then target (4,3). Keep an eye on the enemy's movement; it might come down towards (7,5) or (9,4).\n\nRIGHT",

UP: (1,6) - within board. Check: not your body (your body is at y<=5 and x<=4, except (0,5) but (1,6) is free). Not enemy body (enemy at y>=8). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (1,4) - within board. Check: there is an apple at (1,4)! If you move here, you eat the apple and grow. Also, not your body (your body is at (0,4) and below, but (1,4) is free). Not enemy body. Safe.\n3. LEFT: (0,5) - your own body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (2,5) - within board. Check: not your body (your body is at y=0 for x>=1, and x<=4). Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (6,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (6,9) - within board. Check: not enemy body (enemy body has (3,9) and (2,9) but not (6,9)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,7) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,8) - enemy body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,8) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP to (6,9), DOWN to (6,7), or RIGHT to (7,8). All are safe.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- You are tied at 10 apples with the enemy. Eating the apple at (1,4) would give you the lead (11 vs 10).\n- Moving DOWN to (1,4) directly eats the apple. This is highly advantageous.\n- After eating, your head will be at (1,4) and your tail will extend (so your body will be longer). Then you can move to adjacent cells: (1,3), (1,5) (but (1,5) is your old head, which will become body next turn), (0,4) (your body), or (2,4). So next turn, you can go to (2,4) or (1,3) to avoid hitting yourself.\n- The enemy is far away at (6,8) and unlikely to interfere immediately.\n- Moving UP or RIGHT does not immediately get an apple, but DOWN does.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move to take the lead.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nAfter eating (1,4), you will have 11 apples. Then move to (2,4) (if safe) to avoid backtracking into your body. Then target (4,3) next. Keep an eye on the enemy; it might be heading towards (9,4) or (7,5).

They had 11 apples last turn and moved to (8,8) which had an apple? Actually, last turn there was an apple at (8,8) and they moved RIGHT to (8,8) so they ate it. Now they have 11 apples, same as you.)\n- Apples: 11 (same as you)\n\nPossible moves for your snake:\n1. UP: (2,5) - within board. Check: your body has (1,5) at y=5, but (2,5) is free? Your body: (1,5) is at x=1,y=5. (2,5) is not in your body list. Also not enemy body (enemy is at y>=8). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (2,3) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has y=0-5 but (2,3) is free). Not enemy body. Safe.\n3. LEFT: (1,4) - your own body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (3,4) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has x=0-3,y=0 but not (3,4)). Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (8,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (8,9) - within board. Check: not enemy body (enemy body has (3,9) but not (8,9)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,7) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,8) - enemy body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (9,8) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- You and enemy both have 11 apples. You are tied.\n- The closest apple to you is at (4,3). You can reach it via (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) or (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3).\n- Another apple at (7,1) is also reachable later.\n- Moving RIGHT to (3,4) gets you closer to (4,3) and also opens up more options (you can go up/down/right from there).\n- Moving DOWN to (2,3) also gets you closer to (4,3) via going right then up.\n- Moving UP to (2,5) is safe but moves away from the closest apple (4,3) and might lead to a dead-end with your body below and left.\n- After RIGHT to (3,4), next turn you can go to (3,5), (4,4), or (3,3). This gives flexibility.\n- Avoid moving towards the enemy; they are far (top-right) and you are bottom-left.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to progress towards (4,3) and maintain mobility.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nAfter moving to (3,4), consider going to (4,4) or (3,3) to approach (4,3). Then you can target (7,1) or (7,5). Monitor enemy movement; they might be going for (9,4) or (7,5). Stay away from top-right.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nYour snake (ID 1):\n- Head: (3,4)\n- Body: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]\n- Apples collected: 11\n\nApples at: (9,4), (4,3), (7,1), (7,5), (8,0)\n\nEnemy snake (ID 0):\n- Head: (8,7)\n- Body: [(8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8)]\n- Apples: 11\n\nPossible moves for your snake:\n1. UP: (3,5) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has (1,5) but not (3,5)), not enemy body (enemy is at y>=7). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (3,3) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has y=0-5 but not (3,3)), not enemy body. Safe.\n3. LEFT: (2,4) - your own body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (4,4) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has x=0-2,y=0-5 but not (4,4)), not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (8,7). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (8,8) - enemy body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (8,6) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,7) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,7) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- You and enemy are tied at 11 apples each.\n- The closest apple to you is at (4,3). Moving RIGHT to (4,4) gets you closer to it (next move DOWN to (4,3) to eat).\n- Moving DOWN to (3,3) also gets you closer to (4,3) (next move RIGHT to (4,3) to eat).\n- Moving UP to (3,5) is safe but moves away from (4,3) and also from other apples like (7,1) and (7,5).\n- After eating (4,3), you can target (7,1) or (7,5). (7,1) is closer: from (4,3) to (7,1) is 5 moves (right and down), while (7,5) is 5 moves (right and up).\n- Enemy is at (8,7) and might go for (9,4) or (7,5) or (8,0). They are far from (4,3) and (7,1).\n- To avoid potential head-on collisions, avoid moving towards enemy. They are top-right, you are bottom-left.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,4) is best for immediate progress to (4,3). Next turn, you can go DOWN to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n- Moving DOWN to (3,3) is also good for (4,3) but requires an extra move (RIGHT next) to eat.\n- RIGHT gives more options: from (4,4), you can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT, or even LEFT (but LEFT is back to (3,4) which is safe? Actually, (3,4) is your previous head, but it is now occupied by your body? Wait, your body has (2,4) as first segment, and (3,4) is not in your body? Actually, your body is [(2,4), ...] so (3,4) is free? But it was your head last turn, but now it's empty? Actually, after moving RIGHT to (4,4), your head moves and your body shifts: the tail (2,0) will be removed unless you eat an apple. So (3,4) becomes free? Actually, no: when you move without eating, the tail moves. So after moving RIGHT to (4,4), your body becomes [ (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), ... , (1,0) ] and the tail (2,0) is gone. So (3,4) becomes your neck. So from (4,4), LEFT to (3,4) is your own body (neck) and unsafe. So from (4,4), safe moves would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n- Similarly, from (3,3) (if you move DOWN), safe moves would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT? LEFT to (2,3) is free? Your body has (2,4) and (1,4) etc., but (2,3) is not in your body. So safe.\n- Therefore, both RIGHT and DOWN are good.\n\nBut RIGHT is slightly better because it gets you to (4,4) which is adjacent to (4,3) (the apple) and also to (5,4) etc. for future moves.\n\nAlso, enemy might be heading towards (8,0) or (7,1) or (7,5). But (7,1) is far from them.\n\nSo choose RIGHT to progress towards (4,3).\n\nPlan for next turn:\nAfter moving to (4,4), go DOWN to (4,3) to eat the apple. Then consider going to (5,3) or (4,2) to avoid trapping yourself. Then target (7,1) via (5,3)->(6,3)->(7,3)->(7,2)->(7,1). Monitor enemy movement; they might be going for (9,4) or (7,5).\n\nRIGHT",

UP: (4,5) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has y=0-5 but not (4,5)), not enemy body (enemy is at y>=6). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (4,3) - within board. Check: this is an apple! So if you move here, you eat it and grow. Also, not your body (your body has (0,3) but not (4,3)), not enemy body. Safe.\n3. LEFT: (3,4) - your own body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (5,4) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has x=0-4,y=0-5 but not (5,4)), not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (8,6). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (8,7) - enemy body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (8,5) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,6) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,6) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- You and enemy are tied at 11 apples each.\n- The closest apple is at (4,3). Moving DOWN directly eats it this turn! This is highly advantageous.\n- After eating (4,3), you will have 12 apples and be ahead of the enemy (unless they also eat one this turn). Your body will grow by one segment, so your tail (currently at (1,0)) will not move, and your body becomes longer.\n- From (4,3) after eating, you can consider next moves: UP to (4,4) (which is safe? After eating, your body includes (3,4) and (2,4) etc., but (4,4) is free), DOWN to (4,2) (free), LEFT to (3,3) (free), RIGHT to (5,3) (free). So multiple options.\n- Then you can target other apples: (7,1) or (7,5). (7,1) is closer: from (4,3) to (7,1) is 5 moves (right and down), while (7,5) is 5 moves (right and up).\n- Enemy is at (8,6) and might go for (9,4) or (7,5) or (8,0). They are far from (4,3) and (7,1).\n- Moving DOWN to eat (4,3) is the best immediate move.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe but doesn't get you closer to an apple as directly.\n- Moving UP to (4,5) is safe but moves away from the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the optimal move to eat the apple and gain an advantage.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nAfter eating (4,3), you will have 12 apples. From (4,3), consider moving to (5,3) or (4,2) to avoid trapping yourself. Then head towards (7,1) via (5,3)->(6,3)->(7,3)->(7,2)->(7,1).

UP: (4,4) - your own body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n2. DOWN: (4,2) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has y=0-5 but not (4,2)), not enemy body (enemy is at y>=6). Safe.\n3. LEFT: (3,3) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has (0,3) but not (3,3)), not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (5,3) - within board. Check: not your body, not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (7,6). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (7,7) - within board. Check: not enemy body (enemy body has (8,7) but not (7,7)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (7,5) - within board. This is an apple! So enemy might move here to eat it. Also, not enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (6,6) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,6) - enemy body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- You have 12 apples, enemy has 11. You are ahead.\n- The closest apple is at (4,7) - only 4 moves away (UP twice then RIGHT twice? Actually: from (4,3) to (4,7) is 4 UP moves). But note: (4,7) is close to enemy territory? Enemy head is at (7,6) and body is above.\n- Other apples: (7,1) is 6 moves away (RIGHT and DOWN), (7,5) is 4 moves (RIGHT and UP), (8,0) is 7 moves, (9,4) is 5 moves.\n- Enemy might go for (7,5) this turn (if they move DOWN) or (9,4) (via UP and RIGHT) or (8,0) (DOWN and LEFT).\n- From your position (4,3), moving UP is unsafe (into your body). So you cannot go directly to (4,7) this turn.\n- Instead, consider moving RIGHT to (5,3) to get closer to (7,5) and (7,1). Or DOWN to (4,2) to avoid enemy and then head towards (7,1). Or LEFT to (3,3) to be cautious.\n- After this move, your tail will move: since you ate an apple last turn, your tail (at (1,0)) will not move this turn? Actually: when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So your body length increases, and the tail stays in place for one turn. Then next turn, the tail moves. So currently, your tail is at (1,0) and will remain there this turn. Then next turn, it will move to (0,0)? Actually, the tail movement: the snake moves forward, so the tail follows the path. But since you grew last turn, the tail doesn't advance this turn? In standard Snake, after eating, the tail doesn't move for one turn (so the snake grows). So this turn, when you move, your head moves to a new cell, and the tail remains at (1,0). Then your body segments shift: the old head becomes the new first body segment, etc.\n- So after moving, your body will be: [new head, (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), ... down to (1,0)] (13 segments).\n- To avoid trapping yourself, consider open spaces.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,3) is good: it opens up paths to (6,3), (7,3), etc. Then you can go to (7,5) or (7,1).\n- Moving DOWN to (4,2) is also safe: then you can go to (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), etc. to reach (7,1) or (8,0).\n- Moving LEFT to (3,3) is safe but moves you away from most apples.\n- Enemy might move to (7,5) this turn (if they choose DOWN). So if you go for (7,5), you might compete. But you are farther away.\n- Since you are ahead, you can play safely. Avoid head-on collisions: enemy head at (7,6) might move to (7,5) or (7,7) or (6,6). So if you go RIGHT to (5,3), you are safe.\n\nBest move: RIGHT to (5,3) to start heading towards the apples on the right side (7,5) and (7,1). This keeps options open: from (5,3), you can go UP to (5,4) or RIGHT to (6,3) or DOWN to (5,2). All should be safe next turn.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nAfter moving to (5,3), assess enemy movement. If enemy ate (7,5), they will have 12 apples (tied with you). Then target (7,1) or (9,4). From (5,3), you can go DOWN to (5,2) then RIGHT to (6,2), (7,2), (7,1) to get (7,1). Or go RIGHT to (6,3), (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2), (7,1). Avoid going too close to enemy head (7,6) if it moves towards you.\n\nRIGHT",

However, note that (4,7) is near enemy body (enemy has segments at (4,8), (3,8), etc.).\n- Moving DOWN to (5,2) is safe and gets you closer to (5,1) (one DOWN away). This is very attractive.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,3) is safe and gets you closer to (7,1) and (9,4).\n- The apple at (5,1) is very close. If you move DOWN to (5,2), next turn you can move DOWN to (5,1) to eat it.

So you are much closer.\n- Therefore, moving DOWN to (5,2) sets you up to eat (5,1) next turn.\n- Also, after eating (5,1), you will grow to 13 segments, and enemy remains at 12.\n- However, check safety: after moving DOWN to (5,2), your body will be: [ (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), ... down to (0,0) ] (13 segments). The cell (5,1) is free (no body or enemy). So next turn, moving DOWN to (5,1) is safe.\n- Enemy might move towards (5,1) but they are far. Also, enemy might choose other apples.\n- Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,3) is also good for long-term (to get (7,1) and (9,4)), but (5,1) is closer.\n- Moving UP to (5,4) is less efficient for immediate apple.\n\nBest move: DOWN to (5,2) to secure the apple at (5,1) next turn. This will give you a lead.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nAfter moving to (5,2), move DOWN to (5,1) to eat the apple. Then you will have 13 apples. Then avoid enemy and target other apples like (7,1) or (4,7). From (5,1), you can go LEFT to (4,1) or RIGHT to (6,1) or DOWN to (5,0) (but (5,0) is within board? Yes, y=0 is valid). But note: your tail is at (0,0), so going DOWN to (5,0) is safe. Then you can go to (6,0), (7,0), (8,0) to get the apple at (8,0).\n\nDOWN",

UP: (5,3) - your own body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n2. DOWN: (5,1) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has y=0-5 but not (5,1)), not enemy body. Safe.\n3. LEFT: (4,2) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has x=0-5 but not (4,2)), not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (6,2) - within board. Check: not your body, not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (6,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (6,6) - within board. Check: not enemy body (enemy body has (7,6) but not (6,6)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,4) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,5) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,5) - enemy body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- The closest apple is at (5,1) - directly DOWN from your head. This is a huge opportunity to gain a lead (13 vs 12).\n- Moving DOWN to (5,1) eats the apple immediately. This is safe (as checked above).\n- After eating, your snake will grow to 13 segments. The new body will be: head at (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), ... down to (0,1) (with tail at (0,0) gone? Actually, since you grow, the tail stays: you add a new head at (5,1) and the tail remains (0,0) becomes (0,1)? Wait, no: in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So the head moves to the apple cell, and the tail does not move. So your body becomes: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), ... (0,1), (0,0)]? Actually, the tail remains (0,0) because you don't move the tail when growing. So the new body is 13 segments: head at (5,1), then the old head (5,2), then (5,3), ... down to (0,0).\n- This move is safe and gives you an immediate advantage.\n- Other moves: LEFT to (4,2) or RIGHT to (6,2) do not get an apple this turn. They are safe but less beneficial.\n- Enemy might be targeting (5,1) as well? Enemy head at (6,5) can move LEFT to (5,5), then DOWN to (5,4), then DOWN to (5,3), then DOWN to (5,2), then DOWN to (5,1) - that's 5 moves. So you are much closer.\n- Therefore, moving DOWN to (5,1) is the best move to secure the apple and take the lead.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), you will have 13 apples. Then you can plan to avoid the enemy and target other apples like (7,1) or (4,7). From (5,1), possible moves next turn: UP (to (5,2) - but that is your body), LEFT (to (4,1)), RIGHT (to (6,1)), or DOWN (to (5,0)). So safe moves would be LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. You can go to (4,1) or (6,1) or (5,0). The apple at (8,0) is nearby: from (5,1) to (8,0) is RIGHT3 and DOWN1. Also (7,1) is RIGHT2.\n\nSo immediate plan: move DOWN to eat (5,1) and gain a lead. Then next turn, move to a safe cell (LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN) to avoid the enemy and set up for next apple.\n\nBest move: DOWN to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nDOWN",

UP: (5,2) - your own body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n2. DOWN: (5,0) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has y>=1), not enemy body (enemy body has y>=5). Safe.\n3. LEFT: (4,1) - within board. Check: not your body (your body has x=0-5 but not (4,1)), not enemy body. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (6,1) - within board. Check: not your body, not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake head at (5,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (5,6) - within board. Check: not enemy body (enemy body has (6,5) but not (5,6)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,4) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,5) - within board. Check: not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,5) - enemy body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- You just ate the apple at (5,1) (last move DOWN) and now have 13 apples vs enemy's 12.\n- The closest apples are (7,1) and (8,0) to the right/down, and (4,7) up/left.\n- Moving DOWN to (5,0) gets you closer to (8,0) but also to (7,1). However, (5,0) is safe and opens paths to the bottom row.\n- Moving LEFT to (4,1) is safe and moves toward (4,7) but that is far (6 moves away).\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,1) is safe and moves toward (7,1) (only 2 moves away) and (8,0) (3 moves away).\n- Enemy is at (5,5) and might be targeting (4,7) or (8,4). It can also move toward (7,1) but that would take at least 4 moves (e.g., LEFT to (4,5), DOWN to (4,4), DOWN to (4,3), DOWN to (4,2), LEFT/DOWN to (3,1) etc.) so you are closer.\n- Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,1) is best to target (7,1) quickly. From (6,1), next turn you can go RIGHT to (7,1) to eat the apple, or DOWN to (6,0) to approach (8,0).\n- Avoid moving into areas where enemy might cut you off. Enemy might move DOWN to (5,4) or LEFT to (4,5), which are not immediate threats.\n\nSo immediate plan: move RIGHT to (6,1) to get closer to (7,1) and (8,0). This is safe and sets up for quick apple collection.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, apple at (8,0) wasn\u2019t listed last turn \u2014 last turn apples were (9,4), (8,0?), (8,4), (2,9), (4,9). Actually last turn\u2019s board showed apple at (8,0)? Let\u2019s check: last turn\u2019s board had \u201cA\u201d at (8,0)? No, last turn\u2019s board had \u201c1\u201d at (8,0) (enemy head). Apple at (8,0) wasn\u2019t there. So enemy moved RIGHT to (8,0) last turn? That\u2019s impossible because (8,0) was enemy head already? Wait, last turn enemy head was at (7,0). So if enemy moved RIGHT to (8,0), that\u2019s empty (no apple). But current apples list shows (8,4) and (9,4) but not (8,0). So enemy didn\u2019t eat an apple last turn.  \n\nBut current enemy head is (8,0), so enemy moved RIGHT from (7,0) to (8,0) last turn (no apple there). Now enemy length 15 (apples: 15).  \n\nFrom (8,0):  \n- UP (8,1): empty.  \n- DOWN (8,-1): off board \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT (7,0): its own body segment 1 (old head position) \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT (9,0): empty.  \nEnemy safe: UP, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nMy safe cells: (3,8), (3,6), (2,7).  \nEnemy safe cells: (8,1), (9,0).  \nNo overlap \u2192 no head-on risk.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move:**  \nFrom (3,8):  \n- UP (3,9): empty.  \n- DOWN (3,7): my old head, but after move body occupies (3,7) \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT (2,8): empty.  \n- RIGHT (4,8): my body segment 13 (tail?) Wait, my body after moving: head to (3,8), body becomes [(3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)] \u2014 tail is (5,8). So (4,8) is empty. Actually check: old body was [(4,7), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)], head moved from (3,7) to (3,8), so new body: [(3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)]. So (4,8) is free.

From (3,8), safe moves likely UP/LEFT/RIGHT. Aim to reach (2,9) or (4,9) while watching enemy\u2019s movement from (8,0). Avoid trapping myself in top row.  \n\nUP",

Wait: if I move UP to (3,9), my body becomes [(3,8), (3,7), (4,7), \u2026]. So next turn DOWN from (3,9) goes to (3,8) which is my body segment 1 \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT (2,9) \u2192 apple there.  \n- RIGHT (4,9) \u2192 apple there.  \nSo from (3,9) next turn safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT (2 follow-ups).  \n\nFrom (2,8):  \n- UP (2,9) \u2192 apple.  \n- DOWN (2,7) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (1,8) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,8) \u2192 my body segment 1 \u2192 suicide.  \nSo safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 follow-ups).  \n\nFrom (4,8):  \n- UP (4,9) \u2192 apple.  \n- DOWN (4,7) \u2192 my body segment 2 \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT (3,8) \u2192 my body segment 1 \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT (5,8) \u2192 my tail (5,8) will be gone next turn? Let\u2019s check: after moving RIGHT to (4,8), body becomes [(3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), \u2026], tail at (5,8) is still there this turn, but next turn tail moves forward? Actually tail only moves if no apple eaten. No apple at (4,8), so tail moves: old tail (5,8) disappears, new tail is (6,8). So next turn (5,8) is empty. So RIGHT (5,8) is safe next turn.  \nWait, but DOWN and LEFT are suicide, so from (4,8) next turn safe moves: UP, RIGHT (2 follow-ups).  \n\nSo (2,8) gives 3 safe follow-ups, others give 2.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nApples: (9,4), (8,4), (2,9), (4,9), (3,2).  \nFrom (2,8): UP goes to apple (2,9) next turn.  \nFrom (3,9): LEFT to (2,9) or RIGHT to (4,9) next turn.  \nFrom (4,8): UP to (4,9) next turn.  \n\nLEFT from current head (3,8) to (2,8) gets me to (2,9) apple in 1 move, with 3 safe follow-ups after reaching (2,9).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy movement consideration:**  \nEnemy likely goes UP to (8,2) or RIGHT to (9,1). Either way, far from me. No immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT gives best follow-up options (3) and gets me to apple (2,9) next turn. UP to (3,9) gives fewer follow-ups and risks top-edge trap. RIGHT to (4,8) also fewer follow-ups.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (2,8), next turn eat apple at (2,9) if still there. From (2,9), check safety: likely safe moves will be DOWN, LEFT, maybe RIGHT depending on body. Avoid trapping in top-left corner.  \n\nLEFT",

After eating, my new head at (4, 9) will have to check safety then.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (3, 9), next turn move RIGHT to (4, 9) to eat apple.

So DOWN leads to limited options next turn.\n- After moving UP to (9,5), you'll have options to continue UP to (9,6), LEFT to (8,5), or DOWN to (9,4) (which is your body).

Wait, that\u2019s wrong\u2014let's list clearly:  \n    Current body: [ (6,8), (5,8), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5) ]  \n    After moving DOWN to (6,6) (no apple):  \n    New body: [ (6,7), (6,8), (5,8), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5) ] \u2014 tail (7,5) removed.  \n    So (6,5) is now last body segment, (5,5) before it.  \n  Check moves from (6,6):  \n    UP (6,7) \u2192 body segment 0 \u2192 suicide.  \n    DOWN (6,5) \u2192 body segment 14? Actually new body length 15, (6,5) is last segment (index 14) \u2192 suicide (moving into tail is allowed only if tail moves away, but tail moves away only if we eat apple; no apple here, so tail stays? Wait, tail is removed each turn unless apple eaten. So (6,5) is the old tail position, but after move, tail is removed, so (6,5) is empty? Let\u2019s think:  \n    Current tail = (7,5). After moving without eating apple, tail cell (7,5) is vacated. So (6,5) is not tail now; it\u2019s the second-to-last body segment now. Actually: new body list:  \n    head (6,6)  \n    seg0 (6,7)  \n    seg1 (6,8)  \n    seg2 (5,8)  \n    ...  \n    seg13 (5,5)  \n    seg14 (6,5)  \n    So (6,5) is occupied by seg14. So DOWN into (6,5) is suicide.  \n    LEFT (5,6) \u2192 seg11? Actually (5,6) is seg11 in new body \u2192 suicide.  \n    RIGHT (7,6) \u2192 empty.  \n  So from (6,6) only 1 safe move next turn (RIGHT) \u2192 very risky, could trap me.\n\n**LEFT to (5, 7):**  \n- Next turn from (5, 7):  \n  New body after moving LEFT without apple: head (5,7), body = [(6,7),(6,8),(5,8),(5,9),...,(6,5)] \u2014 tail (7,5) removed.  \n  Check:  \n    UP (5,8) \u2192 body segment 3 \u2192 suicide.  \n    DOWN (5,6) \u2192 body segment 11 \u2192 suicide.  \n    LEFT (4,7) \u2192 body segment 9 \u2192 suicide.  \n    RIGHT (6,7) \u2192 body segment 0 \u2192 suicide.  \n  Oh! That means **LEFT leaves me with zero safe moves next turn** \u2014 immediate death next turn.  \n  So LEFT is actually fatal next turn.  \n\nWait, I must check carefully:  \nCurrent body:  \n0:(6,8)  \n1:(5,8)  \n2:(5,9)  \n3:(4,9)  \n4:(3,9)  \n5:(2,9)  \n6:(2,8)  \n7:(3,8)  \n8:(3,7)  \n9:(4,7)  \n10:(4,6)  \n11:(5,6)  \n12:(5,5)  \n13:(6,5)  \n14:(7,5)  \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,7):  \nNew head (5,7)  \nNew body:  \n0:(6,7)  \n1:(6,8)  \n2:(5,8)  \n3:(5,9)  \n4:(4,9)  \n5:(3,9)  \n6:(2,9)  \n7:(2,8)  \n8:(3,8)  \n9:(3,7)  \n10:(4,7)  \n11:(4,6)  \n12:(5,6)  \n13:(5,5)  \n14:(6,5)  \n\nFrom new head (5,7):  \nUP (5,8) \u2192 occupied by seg2 \u2192 suicide.  \nDOWN (5,6) \u2192 occupied by seg12 \u2192 suicide.  \nLEFT (4,7) \u2192 occupied by seg10 \u2192 suicide.  \nRIGHT (6,7) \u2192 occupied by seg0 \u2192 suicide.  \n\nYes, **LEFT is suicide next turn** \u2014 so not safe in practice.  \n\nSo my earlier \u201csafe moves\u201d DOWN and LEFT both lead to only 1 or 0 safe moves next turn. That means they are traps.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Re-check RIGHT risk:**  \nRIGHT to (7,7): possible head-on if enemy goes LEFT to (7,7).  \nEnemy\u2019s choices: UP (8,8), DOWN (8,6), LEFT (7,7).  \nIf enemy chooses randomly among 3, 1/3 chance of head-on.  \nBut maybe enemy prefers not to risk head-on either? Enemy\u2019s body is long, might avoid moving toward me.  \nStill, too risky given I have no other truly safe move? Wait, DOWN and LEFT are suicide next turn, so they\u2019re not safe either.  \n\nActually, if all immediate safe moves lead to death next turn, I must pick one that at least gives a chance.  \nRIGHT to (7,7) at least gives possible safe moves next turn:  \nFrom (7,7) new body: head (7,7), body = [(6,7),(6,8),(5,8),...,(6,5)]  \nCheck next turn options from (7,7):  \nUP (7,8) \u2192 empty.  \nDOWN (7,6) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (6,7) \u2192 body segment 0 \u2192 suicide.  \nRIGHT (8,7) \u2192 empty unless enemy moves there this turn.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn if enemy not at (8,7).  \n\nBut enemy could be at (8,7) if enemy stays? No, enemy moves this turn too. Possible enemy positions next turn: (8,8), (8,6), or (7,7) if we collide. So (8,7) will be empty next turn.  \nSo from (7,7) next turn, safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nThus **RIGHT is the only move that keeps future options open**, despite head-on risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Assess head-on risk mitigation:**  \nEnemy might avoid LEFT to (7,7) because:  \n1. They see my head at (6,7) and might guess I could go RIGHT.  \n2. They have other safe moves.  \n3. They have more apples (17 vs 15), so they\u2019d likely avoid risky head-on.  \n\nI\u2019ll assume enemy avoids LEFT, so RIGHT is safe this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nFrom (7,7), I can go DOWN next turn toward (7,6) and then toward apples (6,0) or (4,2) area.  \nBetter than dying next turn with DOWN/LEFT choices.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (7,7), next turn go DOWN to (7,6) if safe, then continue toward lower-left apples. Monitor enemy\u2019s new head position\u2014avoid future head-on. Keep escape routes open.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving LEFT creates horizontal distance from the enemy.\n- The apple cluster at (3,2), (3,1), (4,2) is still your primary target and moving LEFT keeps you on a path toward them.\n- The apple at (6,0) is also nearby but requires careful navigation through your own body.\n\nLong-term strategy:\n- Continue working downward and leftward toward the apple cluster at (3,2), (3,1), (4,2).\n- Avoid moving toward the enemy snake which is positioned above and to your left.\n- After moving LEFT, you'll need to plan your next move carefully as your body creates obstacles.\n- Prioritize safe movement while maintaining distance from the enemy.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, tail is (5,5) now, moving to (6,6) without apple means tail moves to (6,5)? Let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nCurrent body length 16 (15 segments + head). No apple at (6,6), so after moving to (6,6), new body = [(7,6) old head becomes segment 0, then (7,7), (6,7), \u2026, (5,5) becomes tail and is removed]. So tail removed is (5,5). New body list: head (6,6), then (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (6,8), (5,8), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (5,6).  \n\nCheck from (6,6) next turn:  \nUP (6,7) \u2192 body segment 3 \u2192 suicide.  \nDOWN (6,5) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (5,6) \u2192 body segment 15 \u2192 suicide.  \nRIGHT (7,6) \u2192 body segment 1 \u2192 suicide.  \n\nSo from (6,6) next turn, only **DOWN (6,5)** is safe \u2192 trapped.  \n\n**LEFT leads to a trap next turn** \u2192 avoid.  \n\n---\n\n**RIGHT (8, 6):**  \nEnemy goes to (7, 5) \u2192 no collision.  \nFrom (8, 6) next turn:  \nSimulate: no apple at (8,6), so new body = head (8,6), then (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (6,8), \u2026, (5,6) as last body segment (tail (5,5) removed).  \n\nCheck moves from (8,6):  \n- UP (8,7) \u2192 enemy body segment 1 currently, but after enemy moves, (8,7) is enemy body segment 0? Wait, enemy\u2019s new body after moving to (7,5): head (7,5), then (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), \u2026 So (8,7) is enemy body segment 2. So still enemy body \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN (8,5) \u2192 enemy\u2019s new head position? No, enemy head is at (7,5) now, (8,5) is enemy body segment 1 \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT (7,6) \u2192 my body segment 1 \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT (9,6) \u2192 enemy body segment 3 \u2192 suicide.  \n\nAll four moves from (8,6) next turn are into bodies \u2192 **RIGHT leads to certain death next turn**.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Conclusion:**  \nDOWN \u2192 head-on collision this turn (enemy forced to (7,5)).  \nLEFT \u2192 safe this turn, but only 1 safe move next turn (trapped).  \nRIGHT \u2192 safe this turn, but 0 safe moves next turn (certain death).  \n\nSo **no safe move**? Wait, check again:  \nFrom (6,6) next turn, only DOWN (6,5) safe, but from (6,5) after that maybe options open. That\u2019s not certain death this turn, just risky.  \nFrom (8,6) next turn, all moves into bodies \u2192 certain death.  \n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, LEFT is better (survive one more turn).  \n\nBut maybe I missed UP? UP from (7,6) is (7,7) which is my body segment 0 \u2192 suicide. Yes.  \n\nSo only LEFT is survivable beyond this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term note:**  \nEnemy forced to (7,5). I go LEFT to (6,6). Next turn only DOWN to (6,5) safe. From (6,5), check apples: (6,0) below, (4,2) left-down, (3,2) further. Need to avoid enemy at (7,5) possibly moving to (7,6) or (6,5) next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \nLEFT now \u2192 (6,6). Next turn DOWN to (6,5) (only safe). Then assess.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, simultaneous moves: at move time, my body segment 0 is still at (7, 6) if I haven\u2019t moved yet. So enemy UP into (7, 6) \u2192 hits my body \u2192 enemy dies.  \n- DOWN (7, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (6, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (8, 5) \u2192 enemy body segment 0 \u2192 suicide.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN (7, 4) and LEFT (6, 5).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nMy only safe move: DOWN to (6, 5).  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves: (7, 4) and (6, 5).  \nIf enemy chooses LEFT to (6, 5) same turn I go DOWN to (6, 5), head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \n\nSo my only safe move is **dangerous** if enemy picks LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Can I risk it?**  \nEnemy has two safe moves: (7, 4) and (6, 5).  \nIf enemy is rational, it will avoid head-on collisions too. It sees:  \n- If enemy goes LEFT to (6, 5), possible collision with me if I go DOWN.  \n- If enemy goes DOWN to (7, 4), no collision possible with me (I can\u2019t reach (7, 4) from (6,6) in one move).  \n\nSo enemy will likely choose DOWN (7, 4) to avoid risk.  \nThus, I can go DOWN to (6, 5) and probably survive.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Next turn considerations:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (6, 5):  \nNo apple there, so my tail (5, 6) is removed, new body = head (6, 5), then (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), \u2026, (4, 6) as last body segment.  \n\nEnemy likely at (7, 4) or (6, 5) if it risked collision.  \nIf enemy at (7, 4), from (6, 5) my next moves:  \n- UP (6, 6) \u2192 my body segment 1 \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN (6, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (5, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (7, 5) \u2192 enemy\u2019s old head position, now empty (enemy moved to (7,4) or (6,5)). If enemy went to (7,4), then (7,5) is empty.  \n\nSo from (6, 5) next turn, I\u2019d have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT possibly safe depending on enemy\u2019s new position. That\u2019s better than being trapped.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Alternative?**  \nI have only one immediate safe move anyway: DOWN. So must take it.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \nGo DOWN to (6, 5). Hope enemy avoids (6, 5) to prevent collision. Next turn, assess based on enemy\u2019s new head position. Try to move toward apple at (6, 0) or (4, 2) while keeping space from enemy.  \n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s trace: current body after move DOWN: head (6,4), then (6,5) old head, then (6,6), (7,6), \u2026, (4,6) is last segment? Actually, tail was (4,6), so after moving without apple, tail disappears, so body becomes: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (6,8), (5,8), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7) \u2014 length 16 still? No, length stays same because no apple eaten, so tail removed: original length 16, after move: head new + 15 old segments except last removed. So last segment removed was (4,6). So body ends at (4,7).  \n\nSo from (6,4) next turn:  \n- UP (6,5) \u2192 occupied by my body segment 1 \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN (6,3) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (5,4) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (7,4) \u2192 enemy\u2019s old head position, now empty if enemy moved.  \n\nSo from (6,4) I\u2019d have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT possibly safe.  \n\nFrom (5,5) next turn (if I go LEFT):  \nBody after move LEFT without apple: head (5,5), then (6,5) old head, then (6,6), (7,6), \u2026, (4,7) as last segment (tail (4,6) removed).  \n\nFrom (5,5):  \n- UP (5,6) \u2192 my body segment 2? Wait, (5,6) is not in new body list: after move, body = (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (6,8), (5,8), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7).

That\u2019s 3 safe moves \u2014 better mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apples:**  \nClosest apple to (5,5) is (4,2) or (3,2) or (3,1) \u2014 need to go left/down.  \nFrom (6,4), closest apple is (6,0) straight down, but enemy might be near.  \n\nGiven enemy is at (7,4) and likely moving DOWN to (7,3), going LEFT to (5,5) keeps me farther from enemy and opens more options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (15 vs 17). Need to survive and collect apples safely.  \nAvoid head-on risks when unnecessary.  \nLEFT now gives good mobility next turn, and I can aim for apples at (4,2) or (3,2) by going DOWN/LEFT next turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo LEFT to (5,5). Next turn, assess enemy\u2019s new head (likely (7,3)), then move toward lower-left apples while keeping escape routes.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, enemy\u2019s move from (6, 3) next turn would be:  \nEnemy safe moves from (6, 3): check board then:  \nUP (6, 4) possible if empty, DOWN (6, 2), LEFT (5, 3), RIGHT (7, 3) maybe body? Need to simulate but not necessary now.  \n\nBetter to avoid moving toward enemy. DOWN (5, 4) is slightly away from enemy\u2019s likely position.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m behind 15 vs 17 apples. Need to collect safely.  \nLEFT (4, 5) gives good mobility and starts moving toward lower-left apples while staying clear of enemy\u2019s immediate path.  \nDOWN (5, 4) also good, but puts me closer to enemy\u2019s possible path to (6, 0) apple \u2014 could compete.  \n\nI think LEFT is slightly safer because enemy is more likely to go DOWN to (7, 2) for apple (6, 0) or (3, 2), leaving left side open.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo LEFT to (4, 5). Next turn, assess enemy\u2019s new head (likely (7, 2) or (6, 3)), then move DOWN toward (4, 2) apple while keeping escape routes.  \n\nLEFT",

(7, 2) will be empty next turn except maybe my tail).  \nEnemy will likely target apple (6, 0) or (3, 2).  \n\nIf I go DOWN (4, 4), I\u2019m moving toward the same apples but from the east side, possibly meeting enemy in 2\u20133 turns.  \nIf I go LEFT (3, 5), I\u2019m moving toward apples from the north, possibly safer from enemy\u2019s immediate path.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m behind 15 vs 17 apples. Need to collect safely.  \nEnemy is forced to (6, 2) this turn, so they\u2019re closer to (6, 0) apple. I should target (4, 2) and (3, 2) from the north/east, but avoid getting trapped in bottom-left corner.  \n\nLEFT (3, 5) sets me up to go DOWN next turn toward (3, 2) while keeping UP/LEFT options open.  \nDOWN (4, 4) also good but might put me in a race with enemy for (4, 2) if enemy moves left then down.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s position, I think LEFT is slightly safer because it moves me away from enemy\u2019s immediate line of movement and toward apples with more space above.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo LEFT to (3, 5). Next turn, enemy will be at (6, 2). I can then go DOWN to (3, 4) toward (3, 2) apple, while keeping UP/LEFT exits.  \n\nLEFT",

But enemy might also go DOWN for (6, 0) apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term safety:**  \nMy body occupies top-right area; enemy\u2019s body occupies right side.  \nGoing DOWN into row 4 and below opens space but risks being near enemy\u2019s path to lower apples.  \nGoing LEFT moves toward open left side and apple (1, 6) with less competition.  \n\nSince I\u2019m behind in apples (15 vs 17), I need to collect safely without dying.  \n(1, 6) is uncontested and reachable via LEFT then UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo LEFT to (2, 5). Next turn, I can go UP to (2, 6) toward (1, 6) apple, or continue LEFT to (1, 5). This avoids immediate conflict with enemy\u2019s likely path to (4, 2) or (6, 0).  \n\nLEFT",

Yes (y=3 valid). Your body: (8,3) exists but not (4,3). Enemy body: none at (4,3). Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,1) - Within board? Yes (y=1 valid). Your body: (8,1) exists but not (4,1). Enemy body: none at (4,1). Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,2) - Within board? Yes (x=3 valid). Your body: none at (3,2). Enemy body: none at (3,2). There is an apple here! Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,2) - Within board? Yes. But your own body has (5,2) as the first segment (immediately behind head). Moving RIGHT would hit your own body and kill you. Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, evaluate the safe moves:\n- LEFT (3,2): Directly collects an apple. This is highly beneficial as it increases your score to 19 and grows your snake.\n- DOWN (4,1): Moves toward the apple at (3,1) and (6,0). Also avoids potential future conflicts.\n- UP (4,3): Moves away from the current apple cluster and might lead to less efficient paths.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake head is at (1,5), which is not immediately threatening your position (distance of |4-1|=3 in x and |2-5|=3 in y). It is moving in the top-right area.\n- Moving LEFT collects an apple immediately and progresses toward the bottom-left apple cluster (including (3,1) and possibly (6,0)).\n- Moving DOWN also progresses toward the same cluster but doesn't collect an apple this turn.\n- Moving UP moves away from the apples and might require more turns to get back.\n\nLong-term strategy:\n- Continue focusing on the bottom-left apples (3,2), (3,1), (6,0)) as they are nearby and safe.\n- Avoid moving into the enemy's territory (top-right) where it is coiled.\n- After collecting (3,2), next turn you can consider moving DOWN to (3,1) for another apple or LEFT to (2,2) to explore further.\n- The enemy has 15 apples (you have 18) and is not an immediate threat, but we should maintain our lead.\n\nBest move:\nLEFT to (3,2) collects an apple immediately and is safe. This is the optimal move to increase your score and continue toward the apple cluster.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nAfter moving to (3,2), we will have collected the apple. Then we can target (3,1) by moving DOWN or (2,2) by moving LEFT. The apple at (6,0) is also accessible via DOWN and RIGHT moves later. Avoid moving UP into empty spaces unnecessarily.\n\nLEFT",

It is unlikely to threaten you this turn.\n- Collecting the apple at (3,1) is highly efficient and continues your strategy of harvesting the bottom-left apples.\n- After collecting (3,1), you can consider moving DOWN to (3,0) or LEFT to (2,1) to approach (6,0) or (0,4).\n- The enemy is still focused on the top-right and not competing for these apples.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Continue collecting the nearby apples: (3,1) now, then (6,0) and (0,4). The apple at (5,6) is closer to the enemy and might be risky.\n- Avoid moving into the enemy's territory (top-right) unless necessary.\n- Maintain your lead (you have 20 apples vs enemy 16) by safely collecting apples.\n\nBest move:\nDOWN to (3,1) to collect the apple immediately.

Let\u2019s check: my tail is at (3, 9), so after moving UP, tail stays unless I eat apple. No apple eaten, so tail moves forward: last segment (3, 9) disappears, new segment added at old head position? No \u2014 growth only on apple. So body shifts: head to (1, 8), segment 1 to (1, 7), segment 2 to (1, 6), etc. So (1, 7) will be my body next turn.

You collected the apple at (3,1), so your snake has grown by one segment. Your body now includes the previous head position (3,2) as the new first segment. The full body is: [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0)] (21 segments total, since you started with 20 apples and now have 21).\n\nApples remaining: (6,0), (2,8), (0,4), (5,6), (4,7)  [Note: (3,1) was eaten]\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (1,7), body: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (6,8), (5,8), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9)]\n\nPossible moves from your head (3,1):\n- UP: (3,2) - Check safety: Within board? Yes (y=2). Your body: (3,2) is the first segment behind your head. Moving UP would hit your own body and kill you. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (3,0) - Within board? Yes (y=0). Your body: none at (3,0). Enemy body: none at (3,0). There is an apple at (6,0) but not here. Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,1) - Within board? Yes (x=2). Your body: none at (2,1). Enemy body: none at (2,1). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,1) - Within board? Yes. Your body: none at (4,1). Enemy body: none at (4,1). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nEvaluate safe moves:\n- DOWN (3,0): Moves towards the apple at (6,0) but not directly. It might be a step to approach (6,0) via (4,0) or (5,0) later.\n- LEFT (2,1): Moves closer to the apple at (0,4) (though still distant). Also avoids the enemy territory.\n- RIGHT (4,1): Moves away from the left-side apples and towards the center. Might be riskier as it gets closer to the enemy's area (enemy head at (1,7)).\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake head is at (1,7), which is not close (distance |3-1|=2 in x, |1-7|=6 in y). It is unlikely to threaten you this turn.\n- The apple at (6,0) is reachable: you could go DOWN to (3,0), then RIGHT to (4,0), (5,0), then DOWN to (6,0)? But (6,0) is at y=0, so from (5,0) you need to go RIGHT to (6,0). Alternatively, from (3,0) you can go RIGHT multiple steps along the bottom row.\n- The apple at (0,4) is also available: moving LEFT repeatedly to (0,1) then UP to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4).\n- The apples at (2,8), (4,7), (5,6) are in enemy territory and risky.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Continue collecting the bottom-left apples: (6,0) and (0,4) are priorities.\n- Avoid the enemy (which is in the top-right) until necessary.\n- You have a lead (21 vs 16), so play safely and don't take risks.\n\nBest immediate move:\n- DOWN to (3,0) sets you up to move RIGHT along the bottom row to (6,0). This is efficient.\n- LEFT to (2,1) is also good for approaching (0,4).\n- RIGHT to (4,1) is less beneficial as it moves away from the apples.\n\nGiven that (6,0) is closer (only 3 steps away horizontally) than (0,4) (which is 4 steps left and 3 up), prioritize (6,0). So DOWN to (3,0) is the best.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nFrom (3,0):\n- Next turn, move RIGHT to (4,0) (to continue towards (6,0)).\n- Then RIGHT to (5,0), then RIGHT to (6,0) to collect the apple.\n- After that, consider moving UP to (6,1) and then LEFT towards (0,4) if safe.\n\nDOWN",

Your body segments are: [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0)]? Wait, note: your body length should be 21 segments (since you had 20 apples and just ate one at (3,1)), but the given body list has 20 segments. Actually, the problem states your body as having 20 segments (from head to tail) and apples collected 20. After eating the apple at (3,1), your body should now have 21 segments. However, the board state shows your head at (3,0) and body starting at (3,1). So the full body is: head (3,0), then (3,1), (3,2), ... up to (8,1) and (8,0)? But the list provided in the problem for your body is 20 segments: [(3,1), (3,2), ... (8,1)]. So actually, your head is at (3,0) and the body segments are 20 long (meaning you have 20 apples, so total length 21). So the tail is at (8,1).\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,0):\n- UP: (3,1) - This is your body segment (the first one behind the head). Moving UP would hit your own body. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (3,-1) - Off the board (y=-1). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (2,0) - Within board. Check: your body? None at (2,0). Enemy body? None at (2,0). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,0) - Within board. Your body? None at (4,0). Enemy body? None at (4,0). Safe.\n\nSo only safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNow, evaluate:\n- LEFT (2,0): Moves towards the apple at (0,4) (though it's a long way). Also, the bottom row is relatively clear.\n- RIGHT (4,0): Moves towards the apple at (6,0). This apple is only 2 steps away: from (4,0) to (5,0) to (6,0).\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is very close and reachable. Moving RIGHT gets you closer to it.\n\nAlso, consider enemy snake #0 at head (1,8) - far away, not an immediate threat.\n\nLong-term plan: Collect the nearby apple at (6,0) first. Then, consider moving up to collect (0,4) or others. Avoid the enemy territory (top-right) for now.\n\nSo, move RIGHT to (4,0) to approach (6,0).\n\nNext turn, from (4,0), you can move RIGHT to (5,0), then RIGHT to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait \u2014 after eating, body becomes: head (2, 8), then (1, 8), then (1, 7), etc. So (2, 7) is free.  \nLEFT (1, 8): my body (segment 2 after move? Actually segment 2 is (1, 8) after move, so (1, 8) is body). So LEFT into body \u2192 suicide next turn.  \nRIGHT (3, 8): empty.  \n\nSo after eating apple at (2, 8), next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 moves). Good.\n\nIf I go UP (1, 9): no apple eaten, tail moves forward (last segment (4, 9) disappears).  \nBody: head (1, 9), then (1, 8), (1, 7), \u2026 (1, 6), etc.  \nFrom (1, 9):  \nUP (1, 10): off-board \u2192 suicide.  \nDOWN (1, 8): body \u2192 suicide.  \nLEFT (0, 9): empty.  \nRIGHT (2, 9): empty.  \n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT safe next turn (2 moves). Worse mobility, top edge.\n\nIf I go LEFT (0, 8): no apple eaten, tail moves forward.  \nFrom (0, 8):  \nUP (0, 9): empty.  \nDOWN (0, 7): empty.  \nLEFT (-1, 8): off-board \u2192 suicide.  \nRIGHT (1, 8): body \u2192 suicide.  \n\nSo only UP and DOWN safe next turn (2 moves). Worse mobility, left edge.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of eating apple now:**  \nEating apple at (2, 8) is safe immediately. Enemy is far away at (3, 0) and can\u2019t reach (2, 8) in one move.  \nBut after eating, I\u2019m at (2, 8) with enemy possibly moving toward (4, 0) or (2, 0).  \nEnemy\u2019s path upward could take several turns; I\u2019ll have time to move away after eating.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nWe\u2019re behind in apples (16 vs 20). Need to catch up.  \nEating (2, 8) now gives 17 apples, still behind but closer.  \nThen from (2, 8), I can go DOWN to (2, 7) next turn, then toward (4, 7) or (5, 6) apples while avoiding enemy\u2019s long body in lower center.\n\nUP or LEFT reduce mobility and delay eating apple, which is risky since enemy could later get (2, 8) if I don\u2019t take it now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Final choice:**  \nRIGHT eats apple, keeps good mobility next turn, and progresses toward catching up in score.\n\nRIGHT",

Total length is 21 (head + 20 body parts).\n\nApples at: (6,0), (0,4), (5,6), (4,7), (1,3)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (2,8), body length 18 (17 apples + head), so total length 18.\n\nPossible moves from (4,0):\n- UP: (4,1) - Check: your body? None at (4,1). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,-1) - Off the board (y=-1). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (3,0) - This is your own body segment (the first one behind the head). Moving LEFT would hit yourself. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (5,0) - Within board. Your body? None at (5,0). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo only safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate:\n- UP (4,1): This moves away from the apple at (6,0) but might open paths to other apples (like (1,3) or (0,4) eventually). However, from (4,1), you have options to go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN would be (4,0) which is your body? Actually, (4,0) is your head's current position, but after moving UP, your body will include (4,0) as the first segment. So DOWN from (4,1) would be (4,0) which is your body - unsafe next turn. So UP now might lead to a dead end if you go up and then have to come down? Not necessarily, but it reduces options.\n- RIGHT (5,0): Moves directly towards the apple at (6,0). From (5,0), next turn you can go RIGHT to (6,0) to eat the apple. Alternatively, from (5,0) you could also go UP to (5,1) if needed.\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is very close (2 steps away). Collecting it quickly is beneficial. Also, moving RIGHT keeps you on the bottom row which is relatively clear.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is far away in the top-left area, not an immediate threat.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (6,0) next turn. Then, consider moving up to collect (1,3) or (0,4). Avoid the enemy territory (top-right) for now. After eating (6,0), your tail will be at (8,2) (since you grow by one segment), so you'll have more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, move RIGHT to (5,0) to approach (6,0).\n\nRIGHT",

Total length is 21.\n\nApples at: (6,0), (0,4), (5,6), (4,7), (1,3)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (3,8), body length 18.\n\nPossible moves from (5,0):\n- UP: (5,1) - Check: your body? None at (5,1). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,-1) - Off the board (y=-1). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (4,0) - This is your own body segment (the first one behind the head). Moving LEFT would hit yourself. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (6,0) - Within board. This is an apple! Eating it would grow you. Your body? None at (6,0). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate:\n- RIGHT (6,0): This moves directly onto the apple. You will grow by one segment (so your tail stays in place). This is highly beneficial as it increases your score and length. After eating, your head will be at (6,0). Next turn, from (6,0), you can move UP to (6,1), LEFT to (5,0) (which will be your body? Actually, after moving RIGHT, your body will include (5,0) as the first segment. So LEFT from (6,0) would be (5,0) which is your body - unsafe next turn). So after eating, you'll have UP and RIGHT as safe moves (DOWN is off board, LEFT is body). So moving RIGHT now gives you immediate apple and sets you up for future moves upward.\n- UP (5,1): This avoids the apple for now. From (5,1), you can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN would be (5,0) which will be your body next turn). This might be safe but delays eating the apple. However, the enemy is far away, so no rush? But eating quickly is good for score and to win faster.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (6,0), you should consider moving up to target the apples at (1,3) or (0,4). The board has many apples in the top-left area. Avoid the enemy snake #0 which is in the top-left as well - but currently at (3,8), which is not directly in your path to (1,3) or (0,4). You can navigate through the bottom and left side to reach them safely.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,0) is the best choice as it immediately collects an apple and doesn't trap you. It leaves you with options to go UP or RIGHT next turn (from (6,0)), which can lead to more apples.\n\nTherefore, move RIGHT to (6,0).\n\nRIGHT",

Your body segments are: [(5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (8,3)] (21 segments). Total length is 22 (since you just ate the apple at (6,0)).\n\nApples at: (0,4), (5,6), (4,7), (1,3), (9,8)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (3,7), body length 17.\n\nPossible moves from (6,0):\n- UP: (6,1) - Check: your body? None at (6,1). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,-1) - Off the board (y=-1). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,0) - This is your own body segment (the first one behind the head). Moving LEFT would hit yourself. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,0) - Within board. Your body? None at (7,0). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate:\n- UP (6,1): This moves upward. From (6,1), you can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN would be (6,0) which is your body). This opens paths to the top-left apples (like (1,3) and (0,4)) or to the right. The enemy is at (3,7) which is above and left, but not directly in your way yet.\n- RIGHT (7,0): This moves right along the bottom edge. From (7,0), you can go UP (to (7,1)) or RIGHT (to (8,0)), but DOWN is off board and LEFT is your body. This might lead to a dead-end along the bottom? However, there is an apple at (9,8) which is far right and top. But moving right now might be less flexible.\n\nLong-term plan: You should target the apples in the top-left: (1,3) and (0,4). They are closer and there are two. The enemy snake #0 is also in that area (head at (3,7)), so you need to be cautious. Moving UP now starts your journey toward that region. Moving RIGHT keeps you along the bottom, which might be safer from the enemy but delays reaching the apples.\n\nAfter moving UP to (6,1), next turn you can go UP to (6,2) but that is your body? Actually, (6,2) is your body (from the list). So from (6,1), you cannot go UP to (6,2) because it is your body. You could go LEFT to (5,1) or RIGHT to (7,1). So moving UP now gives you two options next turn: LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0) gives you UP and RIGHT next turn.\n\nBoth are safe, but UP is more direct toward the top-left apples. Also, the enemy is not immediately threatening you.\n\nTherefore, move UP to (6,1) to start ascending toward the apples.\n\nPlan for next few turns: After moving UP, aim to go left and up to reach (1,3) and (0,4). Avoid the enemy at (3,7) by staying below or to the right of it. Be cautious of head-on collisions; the enemy might also be targeting those apples.\n\nUP",

Wait, after moving UP, my body becomes: new head (4, 8), then old head (4, 7) becomes second segment, then (3, 7), etc. So (4, 7) will be my body next turn \u2192 suicide.  \nLEFT (3, 8): my body \u2192 suicide.  \nRIGHT (5, 8): my body \u2192 suicide.  \nOnly UP safe (1 move). Very risky.  \n\n**If DOWN (4, 6):**  \nNext turn from (4, 6):  \nUP (4, 7): will be my old head \u2192 suicide.  \nDOWN (4, 5): my body \u2192 suicide.  \nLEFT (3, 6): '.' \u2192 safe.  \nRIGHT (5, 6): apple, safe unless enemy moves there.  \nSo LEFT, RIGHT safe (2 moves).  \n\n**If RIGHT (5, 7):**  \nNext turn from (5, 7):  \nUP (5, 8): my body \u2192 suicide.  \nDOWN (5, 6): apple, safe unless enemy moves there.  \nLEFT (4, 7): will be my old head \u2192 suicide.  \nRIGHT (6, 7): my body \u2192 suicide.  \nOnly DOWN safe (1 move).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat to (5, 6)**  \nEnemy at (6, 1) can reach (5, 6) in 5 moves minimum. I can reach it in 2 moves via DOWN then RIGHT, or 2 moves via RIGHT then DOWN. But if I go RIGHT now, next turn only DOWN is safe, so I must go to (5, 6) next turn. That\u2019s fine, but if enemy somehow moves toward it earlier? Unlikely this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nI\u2019m behind 18 vs 21 apples. Need apples quickly. (5, 6) is the nearest.  \nUP is very trapping (only 1 safe move next turn).  \nDOWN gives 2 safe moves next turn and keeps (5, 6) reachable.  \nRIGHT forces me to (5, 6) next turn, but if enemy moves toward it, could be head-on risk? Enemy is far, so low risk.  \n\nBut: if I go RIGHT now, next turn only DOWN is safe, so I must eat (5, 6) next turn. That\u2019s good for score, but after eating, my tail grows, so my body will occupy more space, possibly limiting moves afterward.  \n\nDOWN now gives more flexibility: next turn from (4, 6) I can go LEFT (3, 6) or RIGHT (5, 6). If enemy is near (5, 6) next turn, I can avoid it.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP is too trapping.  \nRIGHT forces a commitment to (5, 6) next turn with no alternative.  \nDOWN keeps options open and still aims for (5, 6) with an escape route.  \n\nGiven I\u2019m behind, I should secure (5, 6) safely. DOWN now, then next turn decide based on enemy position.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter DOWN to (4, 6), check enemy head position. If enemy far, go RIGHT to (5, 6) to eat apple. If enemy close to (5, 6), maybe go LEFT to (3, 6) and aim for (1, 3) or (0, 4) instead. Keep mobility high.  \n\nDOWN",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nYour snake head is at (6,1). Your body segments are: [(6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4)] (21 segments). Total length is 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (5,6), (1,3), (9,8), (0,8)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (4,7), body length 18.\n\nPossible moves from (6,1):\n- UP: (6,2) - This is your own body segment (the 9th segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,0) - This is your own body segment (the 2nd segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,1) - Check: your body? None at (5,1). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,1) - Check: your body? None at (7,1). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate:\n- LEFT (5,1): This moves left. From (5,1), you can go UP to (5,2) but that is your body? (5,2) is your body (8th segment). So UP would be unsafe. You can go LEFT to (4,1) or DOWN to (5,0) which is your body? (5,0) is your body (3rd segment). So from (5,1), only LEFT is safe? Actually, DOWN is (5,0) which is body, UP is (5,2) which is body, RIGHT is (6,1) which is your head? But that's not allowed. So only LEFT to (4,1) is safe next turn? This seems very restrictive.\n- RIGHT (7,1): This moves right. From (7,1), you can go UP to (7,2) but that is your body (10th segment). So UP is unsafe. You can go RIGHT to (8,1) or DOWN to (7,0). DOWN (7,0) is free? Your body doesn't have (7,0). Enemy doesn't have it. So from (7,1), safe moves would be RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT gives you two safe options next turn (RIGHT and DOWN), while moving LEFT only gives one (LEFT). So RIGHT is better for maintaining flexibility.\n\nLong-term plan: You want to reach the apples in the top-left: (0,4) and (1,3). However, the enemy snake #0 is at (4,7) which is near that area. Moving RIGHT now might seem to go away, but it actually allows you to go up the right side and then left across the top? Alternatively, you can go down to (7,0) and then left along the bottom? But the bottom row has your body from (3,0) to (6,0). Actually, from (7,0) you can go LEFT to (6,0) but that is your body. So that path is blocked.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (7,1), you can go DOWN to (7,0) (safe) and then from (7,0) you can only go RIGHT to (8,0) (since LEFT is (6,0) body). Then from (8,0) you can go UP to (8,1) or RIGHT to (9,0). This leads to the bottom-right corner, which might be a dead-end. Alternatively, from (7,1) you can go RIGHT to (8,1), then UP to (8,2), etc. This path goes toward the top-right apple (9,8). But that apple is far and the enemy might get the closer ones.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,1) is risky because it only has one safe follow-up (LEFT to (4,1)), and then from (4,1) you might have more options? But (4,1) is near your body at (4,0) and (3,1). It might lead to a trap.\n\nGiven that RIGHT offers more immediate options, and LEFT is very restrictive, choose RIGHT to avoid getting trapped.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving RIGHT to (7,1), go DOWN to (7,0) to avoid the body above, then right to (8,0), (9,0), then up the right edge. This path is safe and leads to the apple at (9,8). Alternatively, from (7,1) go RIGHT to (8,1), then UP to (8,2) (if free), and continue upward. Avoid the enemy at (4,7) by staying to the right. The enemy is likely going for the top-left apples, so you can target the top-right apple (9,8) which is uncontested.\n\nRIGHT",

So UP (5, 7) is safe unless enemy moves there.  \n- DOWN (5, 5): my body \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT (4, 6): my body \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT (6, 6): my body \u2192 suicide.  \nSo only UP safe (1 move) unless enemy blocks it.  \n\n**If LEFT (3, 6)**  \nNext turn from (3, 6):  \nBody: head (3, 6), then old head (4, 6), then (4, 7), etc.  \nCheck moves:  \n- UP (3, 7): my body \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN (3, 5): my body \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT (2, 6): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (4, 6): my body \u2192 suicide.  \nSo only LEFT safe (1 move).  \n\nBoth options leave only 1 safe move next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat to (5, 7) or (2, 6)**  \nEnemy at (7, 1) is far from both.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Score consideration**  \nI\u2019m behind 18 vs 21. Eating apple now gets me to 19, closer.  \n\nRIGHT (5, 6) gives immediate apple, but next turn only UP (5, 7) is safe.  \nLEFT (3, 6) gives no apple now, next turn only LEFT (2, 6) safe.  \n\nAfter RIGHT + apple, my tail grows, so my body occupies more space, possibly trapping me further. But enemy is far, so maybe I can survive a few more turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nIf I go RIGHT and eat apple, next turn I must go UP to (5, 7). From there, check options. That might lead toward (9, 8) apple eventually.  \n\nIf I go LEFT, I\u2019m moving toward (1, 3) and (0, 4) apples, but I\u2019m not eating now, so enemy could gain more lead.  \n\nGiven I\u2019m behind, taking the apple now seems better, even if it limits next move.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT gets apple, reduces deficit to 2 apples behind, and enemy is far enough that (5, 7) next turn should be safe.  \n\nLEFT avoids apple but keeps me alive with similar limited mobility next turn \u2014 but no score gain.  \n\nI choose RIGHT for the apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (5, 6) and eating apple, next turn only UP (5, 7) is safe. Go UP unless enemy blocks it. Then from (5, 7) reassess \u2014 maybe move toward (9, 8) apple while avoiding enemy body.  \n\nRIGHT",

Your body segments: [(6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4)] (21 segments). Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (5,6), (1,3), (9,8), (0,8)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (4,6), body length 18.\n\nPossible moves from (7,1):\n- UP: (7,2) - This is your own body (11th segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (7,0) - Check: your body? None at (7,0). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (6,1) - This is your own body (2nd segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (8,1) - Check: your body? None at (8,1). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate:\n- DOWN (7,0): From (7,0), possible next moves:\n  - UP: (7,1) - your head? Not allowed, but that would be backwards? Actually, it would be moving into your neck? But (7,1) is your head's previous position? Actually, after moving down, your head is at (7,0), and the next segment is (6,1). So moving UP to (7,1) is not directly backwards? Wait: the body after move: head at (7,0), then (7,1) becomes the neck? Actually, the body list will update: the head moves to (7,0), and the tail is removed? But we are simulating next turn's state. After moving DOWN, your head is at (7,0), and the body becomes [(6,1), (6,0), (5,0), ...] etc. So (7,1) is not part of your body? Actually, it is: because the old head (7,1) becomes the neck? But in the body list, the first segment is the old head? So after moving down, the body list starts with (7,1) (the old head) and then (6,1), etc. Therefore, (7,1) is your body segment. So moving UP from (7,0) to (7,1) would hit your own body. Unsafe.\n  - DOWN: (7,-1) - off board. Unsafe.\n  - LEFT: (6,0) - your body (2nd segment). Unsafe.\n  - RIGHT: (8,0) - free? Your body doesn't have (8,0). Enemy doesn't have it. Safe.\nSo from (7,0), only RIGHT is safe next turn. This is very restrictive.\n\n- RIGHT (8,1): From (8,1), possible next moves:\n  - UP: (8,2) - free? Your body? None at (8,2). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n  - DOWN: (8,0) - free? Safe.\n  - LEFT: (7,1) - your body? (7,1) will be your neck? Actually, after moving right, head at (8,1), body starts with (7,1) (old head) and then (6,1), etc. So (7,1) is body. Unsafe.\n  - RIGHT: (9,1) - free? Safe.\nSo from (8,1), you have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT gives you more flexibility next turn (three options) while moving DOWN only gives one (RIGHT). So RIGHT is better.\n\nLong-term plan: You want to target the apples. The apple at (9,8) is reachable via the right side. From (8,1), you can go UP to (8,2), then continue upward along the right edge (avoiding the enemy). The enemy snake #0 is at (4,6) and might be going for the apples at (0,4), (1,3), or (0,8). You can safely collect (9,8) without conflict. Also, (5,6) is nearby but the enemy is close to it? Actually, enemy head at (4,6) is adjacent to (5,6). So it might get that apple. Avoid head-on collisions.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (8,1) to maintain flexibility. Then next turn, go UP to (8,2) to start moving toward (9,8). Alternatively, if the enemy moves toward (5,6), you can avoid that area.\n\nRIGHT",

Avoid the enemy snake #0 which is near (5,6) and might be going for (1,3) or (0,4). From your current position, moving UP or RIGHT both lead toward (9,8). UP is slightly better because it directly progresses upward without hitting the edge immediately.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (1,0) is available, but it is on the left bottom and enemy snake #0 is long and might be in that area (its tail is near (1,8) and (1,7)).

Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (9,8), (0,8), (1,0)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (5,7), body length 19.\n\nPossible moves from (8,2):\n- UP: (8,3) - Check: your body? None at (8,3). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,1) - This is your own body (1st segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (7,2) - This is your own body (12th segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (9,2) - Check: your body? None at (9,2). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo only two safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate each safe move:\n\n1. UP (8,3):\n   - This moves you upward toward the apple at (9,8). From (8,3), next moves: UP (8,4) is free (no body or enemy), DOWN (8,2) is your neck (unsafe), LEFT (7,3) is your body (13th segment), RIGHT (9,3) is free. So two safe options: UP and RIGHT.\n   - Progresses directly toward (9,8).\n\n2. RIGHT (9,2):\n   - Moves you to the right edge. From (9,2), next moves: UP (9,3) free, DOWN (9,1) free, LEFT (8,2) is your neck (unsafe). So two safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n   - Also positions you to go upward toward (9,8) via UP.\n\nBoth moves are good, but UP is more direct and keeps you away from the edge, giving slightly more flexibility. The apple at (9,8) is a key target. The enemy snake #0 is at (5,7) and might be heading toward (0,8) or (1,3), so the top-right is relatively safe.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving upward to target (9,8). After reaching (8,3), consider UP to (8,4) or RIGHT to (9,3) to avoid potential traps. Avoid moving left/down into enemy territory.\n\nBest move: UP to (8,3).\n\nUP",

Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (9,8), (0,8), (1,0)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (5,8), body length 19.\n\nPossible moves from (8,3):\n- UP: (8,4) - Check: your body? None at (8,4). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,2) - This is your own body (1st segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (7,3) - This is your own body (14th segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (9,3) - Check: your body? None at (9,3). Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo only two safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate each safe move:\n\n1. UP (8,4):\n   - Moves you upward toward the apple at (9,8). From (8,4), next moves: UP (8,5) is your body (17th segment) - unsafe, DOWN (8,3) is your neck - unsafe, LEFT (7,4) is your body (15th segment) - unsafe, RIGHT (9,4) is free. So only one safe follow-up: RIGHT to (9,4). This is restrictive.\n   - However, it progresses toward (9,8) and avoids the edge.\n\n2. RIGHT (9,3):\n   - Moves you to the right edge. From (9,3), next moves: UP (9,4) free, DOWN (9,2) free, LEFT (8,3) is your neck - unsafe. So two safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n   - This gives more flexibility for future moves and positions you to go upward toward (9,8) via UP.\n\nConsidering the follow-up moves, RIGHT (9,3) is better because it offers two safe options (UP and DOWN) next turn, whereas UP (8,4) only offers one (RIGHT). This reduces the risk of being trapped.\n\nThe apple at (9,8) is still a key target. Moving RIGHT to (9,3) allows you to then go UP to (9,4), and continue upward. The enemy snake #0 is at (5,8) and might be heading toward (0,8) or (1,3), so the top-right is relatively safe.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving upward to target (9,8). After reaching (9,3), go UP to (9,4) to avoid potential traps. Avoid moving left/down into enemy territory.\n\nBest move: RIGHT to (9,3) for better flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow evaluate each safe move:\n\n1. UP (9,5):\n   - Moves you upward toward the apple at (9,8). From (9,5), next moves: UP (9,6) free, DOWN (9,4) is your neck - unsafe, LEFT (8,5) is your body (last segment? Actually (8,5) is in your body: it's the 19th segment? Wait, check: your body list has (8,5) at index 19? Actually, your body is [(9,3), (8,3), ... , (8,5), (8,6)]. So (8,5) is occupied by your body. So LEFT is unsafe next turn. So only UP (9,6) is safe next turn? But we must check further.\n   - Actually, at (9,5), LEFT (8,5) is your body segment (the one before tail) - unsafe. So only UP is safe next turn? That is restrictive.\n   - However, moving UP gets you closer to (9,8) and you can reassess next turn.\n\n2. LEFT (8,4):\n   - Moves you left.

So no safe moves next turn! This is a dead end.\n   - Therefore, LEFT is a bad move because it traps you immediately.\n\nSo only UP is truly safe, as LEFT leads to certain death next turn (no escape).\n\nTherefore, you must move UP to (9,5). Then next turn, you can only move UP to (9,6) (since other directions are blocked by your body). Then to (9,7), then to (9,8) for the apple.\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP to (9,5), then UP to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), then UP to (9,8) to eat the apple. After that, you'll grow and have more options. Avoid moving left into your body. The enemy is at (7,8) and might be moving toward (0,8) or (1,3), so the top row is safe for now.\n\nBest move: UP to (9,5) to progress toward the apple and avoid trapping yourself.\n\nUP",

Alternatively, if needed, you can move LEFT to (8,6) to avoid potential threats (but enemy is at (8,8) and might move away). The enemy snake #0 is at (8,8) and might move toward (0,8) or (1,3), so the top row is safe for now.\n\nSince only UP is safe, you must take it.

That\u2019s risky \u2014 could trap me.  \n\n**DOWN to (9, 7):**  \nFrom (9, 7):  \n- UP (9, 8) \u2192 body (old head) \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN (9, 6) \u2192 enemy head currently there, but enemy will move away this turn. Next turn (9, 6) will be empty (enemy body after move? Let\u2019s check: enemy moves now, so (9, 6) will be empty unless enemy goes LEFT to (8, 6) and leaves tail behind). Actually enemy\u2019s tail is at (7, 5), so (9, 6) will be empty next turn unless enemy stays there (but enemy can\u2019t stay). So DOWN from (9, 7) next turn to (9, 6) might be safe.  \n- LEFT (8, 7) \u2192 '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 invalid.  \nSo from (9, 7) next turn, possible safe moves: DOWN (9, 6), LEFT (8, 7) \u2014 2 safe moves.  \n\nBut DOWN this turn risks head-on collision if enemy goes UP to (9, 7).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Collision probability**  \nEnemy has two safe moves: UP (9, 7) and LEFT (8, 6).  \nIf enemy chooses randomly, 50% chance of UP.  \nIf enemy is rational, maybe it avoids (9, 7) because it sees my head at (9, 8) and might predict I go DOWN? But it doesn\u2019t know my move. Still, risky.  \n\nUP (9, 9) has no collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI\u2019m behind 20 vs 21 apples. Need to survive and get to remaining apples.  \nFrom (9, 9) next turn only LEFT to (8, 9) is safe, then from (8, 9) maybe go to (7, 9) etc., work toward (0, 9) apple eventually.  \nFrom (9, 7) next turn more options, but collision risk now is too dangerous when I\u2019m only 1 apple behind.  \n\nBetter to avoid 50% death chance. Choose UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 9), go LEFT to (8, 9), then aim to traverse top row toward (0, 9) apple while avoiding getting trapped. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s path toward other apples.  \n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nYour snake head is at (9,6). Your body segments: [(9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)] (21 segments). Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (0,8), (1,0), (0,9)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (9,8), body length 20.\n\nPossible moves from (9,6):\n- UP: (9,7) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (9,5) - This is your own body (1st segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (8,6) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: Off the board (x=10). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves are UP and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (9,8). Its possible moves from there:\n- UP: (9,9) - Off board? Actually, y=9 is top, so (9,9) is valid. There is an apple at (0,9) but that's far. (9,9) is free? Board shows '.' at (9,9) in the grid? Wait, the grid has \"9 A . . . . . . . . .\" meaning (0,9) is A? Actually, the grid is labeled with y-coordinate from 9 to 0 top to bottom, and x from 0 to 9. So row 9: x=0 to 9: (0,9)=A, (1,9)=., (2,9)=., ... (9,9)=. So (9,9) is free.\n- DOWN: (9,7) - Free? Your head is at (9,6), so (9,7) is free.\n- LEFT: (8,8) - This is its own body (first segment? Actually, its body: head (9,8), then (8,8) is its neck. So unsafe for it.\n- RIGHT: Off board (x=10) unsafe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP to (9,9) or DOWN to (9,7). It might go for the apple at (0,9) but that's far. Or it might come down to (9,7).\n\nIf you move UP to (9,7), you might collide with the enemy if it moves DOWN to (9,7) simultaneously. That would be a head-on collision and both die. Since you have 21 apples and enemy has 20, you would win if both die? But wait: if both die, the game ends and you have more apples (21 vs 20) so you win. However, if the enemy moves UP to (9,9), then you are safe at (9,7). So moving UP has a risk of collision but if it happens you win.\n\nIf you move LEFT to (8,6), you avoid the enemy entirely. Then next turn you can go to (8,7) or (7,6) etc. There is an apple at (0,8) and (1,3) but they are far. Alternatively, you can plan to go toward the top row later.\n\nLong-term: You are leading by 1 apple. The enemy is close. If you can avoid dying and force the enemy to die, you win. Also, if you eat one more apple (to 22) and the enemy doesn't, you extend lead.\n\nBut note: the enemy might not take the risk to go to (9,7) because it would collide with you? Actually, from its perspective, moving DOWN to (9,7) is safe only if you don't go there. But it doesn't know your move.\n\nSince you have a lead, it might be safer to avoid potential collision. Moving LEFT to (8,6) is safe and gives options: next turn you can go UP to (8,7) or LEFT to (7,6) etc. Also, the enemy might be going for the apple at (0,9) so it might move UP.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,7) is aggressive: if enemy moves DOWN, you both die and you win. If enemy moves UP, you are safe and can go to (9,8) next turn to eat the apple? Wait, apple at (0,8) and (0,9) but (9,8) has no apple? Apples are at (0,4), (1,3), (0,8), (1,0), (0,9). So (9,8) has no apple. But (0,8) and (0,9) are far.\n\nActually, the apple at (0,9) is on the top-left. So enemy might move UP to (9,9) to start going left.\n\nGiven that, moving UP to (9,7) is likely safe because enemy will probably go UP to (9,9) to avoid collision and go for the apple. So I think UP is safe.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT to (8,6) is safe but might not progress toward apples.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (9,7) this turn. Then next turn, if enemy is at (9,9), you can move UP to (9,8) (which is free) and then later go left. Or if enemy is not there, you can move to (9,8). Also, from (9,7) you can move LEFT to (8,7) next turn.\n\nSo UP is good.\n\nTo be cautious, since you have lead, avoid risk. But the risk of collision is low because enemy has a safe move UP.\n\nI choose UP.\n\nUP",

Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,7) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves are DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (8,9).

Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,9) - This is its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy must move LEFT to (7,9).\n\nTherefore, there is no risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: You are leading by 1 apple. The enemy is trapped in the top-right corner and has only one move (LEFT to (7,9)). Next turn, the enemy will be at (7,9). From there, it can move DOWN to (7,8) (free? Check enemy body: (7,8) is fourth segment? Enemy body: [(9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), ...] so (7,8) is enemy body - unsafe), or LEFT to (6,9) (free), or UP off board, or RIGHT to (8,9) (its own head? No, but (8,9) is now empty? Actually, after moving to (7,9), its tail might move? But we need to check the board state). Actually, the enemy body is long (20 segments) and (7,8) is occupied by its body. So enemy at (7,9) next turn can only move LEFT to (6,9) or RIGHT to (8,9) (which is now free? But (8,9) was its head, now moved). However, RIGHT to (8,9) is safe? Because its head was there, but it moved away. But we need to check if (8,9) is occupied by its body? The enemy body segments are: [(9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7), ...] so (8,9) is not in the body? Actually, (9,9) is the first segment, (9,8) second, (8,8) third, etc. So (8,9) is free. So enemy at (7,9) can move RIGHT to (8,9) or LEFT to (6,9). Both are safe.\n\nYou should aim to collect apples on the left side: (0,4), (1,3), (1,0), (0,8), (0,9). The apples at (0,8) and (0,9) are especially valuable. Since you are at (8,7), moving DOWN to (8,6) or LEFT to (7,7) are both safe. Moving LEFT gets you closer to the left side. Moving DOWN might be useful to avoid the enemy and then head left.\n\nHowever, note that the enemy is moving to (7,9). If you move LEFT to (7,7), you are directly below the enemy. Next turn, if you go UP to (7,8), you might risk head-on collision if the enemy goes DOWN to (7,8)? But enemy cannot go DOWN to (7,8) because it is its own body. So no risk. Actually, enemy at (7,9) cannot go DOWN to (7,8) (enemy body), so it can only go LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nSo both moves are safe. But moving LEFT (to (7,7)) is better because it gets you closer to the apples on the left. From (7,7), you can then go LEFT again to (6,7) or DOWN to (7,6), etc.\n\nTherefore, choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Moving LEFT to (6,7) gets you closer to the left side. Moving DOWN to (7,6) might be useful to avoid the enemy and then head left, but it is slightly farther from the apples.\n\nFrom (6,7), you can continue left towards (5,7), etc., which is a direct path to the apples. From (7,6), you would need to go left or down, which might take longer.\n\nTherefore, choose LEFT to progress towards the apples efficiently.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy body includes (6,8) (fifth segment). So unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,6) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,7) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body includes (5,7) (ninth segment). So unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,7) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo only safe move is DOWN to (6,6).\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (6,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (6,10) - Off board. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,8) - This is its own body (fifth segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,9) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,9) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body?

Unsafe.\n\nTherefore, enemy must move LEFT to (5,9).\n\nSo no risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: You are forced to move DOWN to (6,6). From there, you can plan to go left towards the apples. The enemy is moving to (5,9). Next turn, you'll be at (6,6) and enemy at (5,9). You should avoid moving up (towards enemy) and instead go left or down to continue towards the apples on the left. The apples at (1,0) and (1,3) are reachable by going down and left. Also, note the apple at (0,4) and (0,8),(0,9). Since you are longer, you can potentially trap the enemy in the top-right corner while you collect apples.\n\nFor now, only DOWN is safe.

After (0, 9), I can go DOWN to (0, 8) apple, then continue down column 0 toward (1, 0) apple.  \n\nEnemy\u2019s position (6, 6) suggests he might go for (1, 3) or (0, 4) apples via moving LEFT/DOWN, but he\u2019s several moves away.  \n\nFor now, continue left along top row toward (0, 9).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 9), I\u2019ll have LEFT to (3, 9) or DOWN to (4, 8). If enemy moves toward my planned path, I may need to adjust, but for now LEFT keeps me on the apple path and maintains future options.  \n\nLEFT",

Your body segments: [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] (21 segments). Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (0,8), (1,0), (0,9)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (5,9), body length 20.\n\nPossible moves from (6,6):\n- UP: (6,7) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,5) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body includes (1,5) but not (6,5). Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,6) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body includes (5,6) (eleventh segment). So unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,6) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (5,9). Its possible moves from last turn's prediction (it moved LEFT to (5,9) as expected). Now from (5,9):\n- UP: (5,10) - Off board. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (5,8) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body includes (5,8) (ninth segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (4,9) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,9) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body includes (6,9) (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nTherefore, enemy must move LEFT to (4,9).\n\nSo no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nLong-term plan: You have two safe moves: DOWN to (6,5) or RIGHT to (7,6). Moving RIGHT (7,6) is closer to the top-right corner where there are apples (0,8) and (0,9), but also closer to the enemy. However, the enemy is moving to (4,9), so it is moving away. Moving DOWN (6,5) leads towards the bottom-left apples (1,0) and (1,3) and (0,4). Since you are longer (22 vs 20), you can afford to be aggressive. However, the enemy might be forced into a corner soon.\n\nPreferred move: RIGHT to (7,6) because it opens up more options (you can go up to (7,7) next turn, but note (7,7) is your body, so you'd have to avoid that) or right to (8,6) etc. Alternatively, DOWN to (6,5) leads to a more confined area with your own body nearby. Also, there is an apple at (1,0) which is far, but (0,8) and (0,9) are closer if you go right and up.\n\nActually, from (7,6), next turn you can go UP to (7,7) but that is your body? Wait, your body has (7,7) as the second segment. So next turn, if you move to (7,6) now, then your body becomes [(7,6), (6,6), (6,7), ...]. So (7,7) will be free next turn? Because your tail moves forward. Similarly, (8,7) etc. So actually, moving RIGHT is good because it frees up space.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (4,9) and will likely be trapped in the top-left corner. So you can go right and then up to collect the apples (0,8) and (0,9).\n\nTherefore, choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (8,6) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (4,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (4,10) - Off board. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (4,8) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body includes (3,8) (sixteenth segment) but not (4,8). Actually, enemy body has (2,8), (1,8), etc. (4,8) is free? Wait, enemy body: [(5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]. So (4,8) is not in enemy body. Safe for enemy.\n- LEFT: (3,9) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,9) - This is enemy's own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN to (4,8) and LEFT to (3,9).\n\nLong-term plan: You have two safe moves: DOWN to (7,5) or RIGHT to (8,6). Moving RIGHT (8,6) is closer to the top-right apples (0,8) and (0,9). However, the enemy is at (4,9) and might move down or left. Moving DOWN (7,5) leads towards bottom-left apples (1,0), (1,3), and (0,4). Since you are longer (22 vs 20), you can be aggressive.\n\nHowever, note that the enemy has two safe moves and might not be trapped yet. Also, from (8,6), you can go UP to (8,7) next turn? But (8,7) is your body (fourth segment). However, next turn your tail will move, so (8,7) might be free? Actually, your body will be [(8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), ...] so (8,7) is still occupied by your body (the old head moved to (7,6) and the tail didn't grow). So (8,7) remains occupied. Similarly, (9,7) is also occupied. So moving RIGHT to (8,6) might lead to a dead end if you go up later.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7,5) opens up more options: from (7,5), you can go LEFT to (6,5), RIGHT to (8,5), or DOWN to (7,4). All these are likely free (check: (6,5) is free, (8,5) is free, (7,4) is free). So DOWN gives more flexibility.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (1,0) which is far, but also at (1,3) and (0,4) which are closer. Moving down starts heading that way.\n\nTherefore, prefer DOWN to (7,5) for better future options.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (7,5), consider going LEFT to (6,5) or DOWN to (7,4) to avoid the enemy and collect bottom-left apples. The enemy is likely to move towards the top-left corner, so you can safely collect the bottom apples.\n\nDOWN",

Your body segments: [(7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)] (21 segments). Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (0,8), (1,0), (0,9)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (3,9), body length 20.\n\nPossible moves from (7,5):\n- UP: (7,6) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (7,4) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body does not include (7,4). Safe.\n- LEFT: (6,5) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,5) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (3,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (3,10) - Off board. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (3,8) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body includes (3,8) (seventeenth segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (2,9) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,9) - This is enemy's own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: only LEFT to (2,9).\n\nLong-term plan: You have three safe moves: DOWN to (7,4), LEFT to (6,5), or RIGHT to (8,5). Moving DOWN (7,4) continues towards the bottom-left apples (1,0), (1,3), and (0,4). Moving LEFT (6,5) also heads in that direction. Moving RIGHT (8,5) goes towards the right side, which has fewer apples currently.\n\nSince the enemy is forced to move LEFT to (2,9), it is moving away from the bottom-left apples. This is a good opportunity for you to collect the apples in the bottom-left corner. You should prioritize moving towards (1,0), (1,3), and (0,4).\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, both are good. DOWN (7,4) is directly towards the bottom, and from there you can go further down or left. LEFT (6,5) is also towards the left. However, note that your body occupies (6,6) and (6,7), so moving LEFT to (6,5) is safe and opens up future moves to (5,5), (6,4), etc.\n\nTo maximize progress towards the apples, moving LEFT to (6,5) is slightly better because it gets you closer to (1,0) and (0,4) in terms of x-coordinate. Then next turn you can go DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5).\n\nAlso, avoid moving RIGHT (8,5) as it doesn't help much with apple collection and might lead to a dead end later (the right side has your body wrapping around).\n\nTherefore, prefer LEFT to (6,5).\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving LEFT to (6,5), consider going DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5) to continue towards the bottom-left apples. The enemy is moving left to (2,9), so it is not a threat in the bottom area. You can safely collect the apples.\n\nLEFT",

Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (0,8), (1,0), (0,9)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (2,9), body length 20.\n\nPossible moves from (6,5):\n- UP: (6,6) - This is your own body (third segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,4) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body does not include (6,4). Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,5) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,5) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (2,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (2,10) - Off board. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (2,8) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body includes (2,8) (last segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,9) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,9) - This is enemy's own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: only LEFT to (1,9).\n\nLong-term plan: You have two safe moves: DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5). Both are good for heading towards the bottom-left apples (1,0), (1,3), and (0,4). The enemy is moving LEFT to (1,9), which is away from these apples.\n\nDOWN (6,4) gets you closer to the apples in terms of y-coordinate (lower y). LEFT (5,5) gets you closer in x-coordinate (left). Since there are apples at (1,0) and (1,3) which are low y, and (0,4) which is low y and left, DOWN might be slightly better to start descending.\n\nAlso, note that your body occupies (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), etc., so moving DOWN to (6,4) avoids getting too close to your own body trail. From (6,4), you can then go LEFT to (5,4) or DOWN to (6,3) next turn to continue towards the apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,5) is also safe, but it keeps you at a higher y-level, which might require more moves to descend later.\n\nTherefore, prefer DOWN to (6,4) to start moving down towards the apples.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (6,4), consider going LEFT to (5,4) or DOWN to (6,3) to approach the apples at (1,3) and (1,0). The enemy is at (1,9) and moving away, so no immediate threat.\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,3) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body does not include (6,3). Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,4) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,4) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo all three moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (1,9). Its possible moves from last turn: only LEFT to (1,9) was safe? Actually, wait: last turn enemy head was at (2,9) and moved LEFT to (1,9). Now enemy head is at (1,9). From (1,9), enemy possible moves:\n- UP: (1,10) - Off board. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,8) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body includes (2,8) (last segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (0,9) - There is an apple at (0,9). Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,9) - This is enemy's own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: only LEFT to (0,9). It will eat the apple at (0,9) and grow to length 21.\n\nLong-term plan: You have three safe moves: DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,4), or RIGHT to (7,4). Your goal is to collect apples at (1,3), (1,0), and (0,4). Moving DOWN to (6,3) gets you closer to these apples (lower y). Moving LEFT to (5,4) also gets you closer (left). RIGHT to (7,4) moves you away from the apples.\n\nTherefore, avoid RIGHT as it moves you towards the right edge and away from the apples. Prefer DOWN or LEFT.\n\nDOWN to (6,3) is good because it descends towards the apples. From (6,3), next moves could be LEFT to (5,3) or DOWN to (6,2) to approach (1,3) and (1,0).\n\nLEFT to (5,4) is also good, but you are still at y=4, which is higher than the apples (y=3,0). So DOWN is more direct.\n\nAlso, note that enemy is moving to (0,9) and eating the apple there. It will be at length 21 (same as you after growth? Actually you have 21 apples, length 22. Enemy has 20 apples, length 20. After eating (0,9), enemy will have 21 apples and length 21. So you are tied in apples? Actually, you have 21 apples, enemy will have 21 after this turn. So it's important to get the next apple quickly.\n\nThe apples at (1,3) and (1,0) are reachable. (0,4) is also nearby. So moving DOWN to (6,3) positions you better.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: From (6,3), you can go LEFT to (5,3) or DOWN to (6,2). Both are likely safe. From (5,4), you can go DOWN to (5,3) or LEFT to (4,4). So both are good.\n\nBut DOWN is more aggressive in descending.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (6,3), aim for LEFT to (5,3) or DOWN to (6,2) to get closer to (1,3) and (1,0). The enemy is at (0,9) and will be busy with the top row, so you have time to collect the bottom apples.\n\nTherefore, choose DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

From there:  \n- DOWN (0,7) safe.  \n- RIGHT (1,8) might be safe if tail moved.  \n\nTail will move after first apple (turn 108), so by turn 109 (after second apple), (1,8) might be free. That gives me options to go right into board interior.  \n\nEnemy is far away in bottom/middle, can\u2019t reach column 0 quickly.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision**  \nLEFT secures two apples fast, ties score, and gives me length advantage. Risk is being stuck along left edge after (0,8), but tail movement should free space.  \n\nDOWN avoids being trapped but gives enemy chance to get more apples and widen lead.  \n\nGiven the apple race (enemy 21 vs my 20), securing two apples now is critical.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nTurn 107: LEFT to (0,9) eat apple.  \nTurn 108: DOWN to (0,8) eat apple.  \nThen assess from (0,8): likely DOWN to (0,7) or RIGHT to (1,8) if free.  \n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nYour snake head is at (6, 3). Your body segments: [(6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0)] (21 segments). Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (0,8), (1,0), (7,4)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (0,9), body length 21 (since it ate the apple at (0,9) last turn).\n\nPossible moves from (6,3):\n- UP: (6,4) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,2) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? Enemy body does not include (6,2). Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,3) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,3) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (0,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (0,10) - Off board. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (0,8) - There is an apple at (0,8). Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: Off board (x=-1). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,9) - This is enemy's own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: only DOWN to (0,8). It will eat the apple at (0,8) and grow to length 22 (same as you).\n\nLong-term plan: You need to collect apples at (1,3), (1,0), (0,4), and (7,4). Moving DOWN to (6,2) gets you closer to (1,3) and (1,0) (lower y). Moving LEFT to (5,3) also gets you closer (left). RIGHT to (7,3) moves you towards (7,4) (the apple at (7,4)), but note that (7,4) is also close to your body? Actually, your body has segments at (9,4), (8,3), etc., but (7,4) is free.\n\nHowever, the apples at (1,3) and (1,0) are more critical because the enemy is on the top row and will likely continue downwards? After eating (0,8), enemy head will be at (0,8). From there, it might try to go DOWN to (0,7) or RIGHT to (1,8) to avoid trapping itself. But it has limited options.\n\nYour priority should be to collect the bottom apples quickly. Moving DOWN to (6,2) is the most direct way to descend towards (1,0) and (1,3). From (6,2), you can go LEFT to (5,2) or DOWN to (6,1) (but (6,1) is your body? Actually, (6,1) is your body segment. So from (6,2), DOWN is unsafe. So you would have to go LEFT to (5,2) or RIGHT to (7,2). So DOWN to (6,2) is safe, but next moves might be limited.\n\nLEFT to (5,3) is also good. From (5,3), you can go DOWN to (5,2) or LEFT to (4,3) to approach (1,3). This seems flexible.\n\nRIGHT to (7,3) leads to (7,4) which has an apple. But eating (7,4) would grow you to length 23, but it might not be as strategic as the bottom apples? Also, after eating (7,4), you would be at (7,4) and then can go DOWN to (7,3) or LEFT to (6,4) (which is your body) or RIGHT to (8,4). So it might be a short-term gain.\n\nBut since the enemy is tied with you in apples (both 21), and you both have length 22, you need to secure the apples first. The apples at (1,3) and (1,0) are uncontested? The enemy is far away. So you should focus on them.\n\nTherefore, prefer DOWN or LEFT.\n\nDOWN to (6,2) is safe, but check next moves: from (6,2), UP is unsafe (your body at (6,3)), DOWN is unsafe (your body at (6,1)), LEFT to (5,2) is safe, RIGHT to (7,2) is safe. So two safe moves.\n\nLEFT to (5,3): from (5,3), UP to (5,4) is safe? (5,4) is free. DOWN to (5,2) is safe. LEFT to (4,3) is safe. RIGHT to (6,3) is unsafe (your head was there). So three safe moves.\n\nSo LEFT has more follow-up options.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT to (5,3) gets you closer to (1,3) and (1,0) in the x-direction.\n\nTherefore, choose LEFT.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving LEFT to (5,3), aim for DOWN to (5,2) or LEFT to (4,3) to approach the apples at (1,3) and (1,0). The enemy is at (0,8) and will likely move to (0,7) or (1,8) next, so it is not an immediate threat. Secure the bottom apples quickly.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nYour snake head is at (5, 3). Your body segments: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0)] (21 segments). Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (1,0), (7,4), (1,2)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (0,8), body length 22 (since it ate the apple at (0,8) last turn? Actually, it had 22 apples already? Scores: enemy has 22 apples, you have 21. So enemy length is 23 (since initial length is 1 + apples eaten). But from the body list, it has 22 segments? Actually, the body list for enemy has 22 segments (head + 21 body parts), so length 23. Similarly, your length is 22 (head + 21 body parts).\n\nPossible moves from (5,3):\n- UP: (5,4) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,2) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,3) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,3) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (0,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (0,9) - This is its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (0,7) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: Off board (x=-1). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,8) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN to (0,7) and RIGHT to (1,8).\n\nLong-term plan: You need to collect apples to catch up to the enemy (22 vs 21). The apples at (1,3), (1,0), (0,4) are in the bottom-left. The apple at (7,4) is nearby. Also, there is a new apple at (1,2) which is very close to (1,3) and (1,0).\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,2) gets you closer to (1,2), (1,3), and (1,0). From (5,2), you can go LEFT to (4,2) or DOWN to (5,1) (safe? (5,1) is free) or RIGHT to (6,2) (safe). This is good.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,3) also gets you closer to the bottom-left apples. From (4,3), you can go DOWN to (4,2) or LEFT to (3,3) to approach.\n\nMoving UP to (5,4) moves you away from the bottom apples and towards the top, but there are no apples directly above except possibly (7,4) which is to the right. But this might not be efficient.\n\nTherefore, prefer DOWN or LEFT.\n\nCheck follow-up moves:\n- DOWN to (5,2): safe moves from there: UP (5,3) is unsafe (your head was there), DOWN (5,1) safe, LEFT (4,2) safe, RIGHT (6,2) safe. So three safe moves.\n- LEFT to (4,3): safe moves from there: UP (4,4) safe, DOWN (4,2) safe, LEFT (3,3) safe, RIGHT (5,3) unsafe (your head was there). So three safe moves.\n- UP to (5,4): safe moves from there: UP (5,5) safe, DOWN (5,3) unsafe, LEFT (4,4) safe, RIGHT (6,4) unsafe (your body at (6,4)). So two safe moves.\n\nSo UP has fewer options and moves you away from the target apples.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, both are good. DOWN to (5,2) is slightly better because it gets you one step closer to (1,2) and (1,0) (y=2 vs y=3). Also, (1,2) is a new apple that just appeared? Actually, it was listed in apples at: (0,4), (1,3), (1,0), (7,4), (1,2). So (1,2) is available.\n\nTherefore, choose DOWN.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (5,2), aim for LEFT to (4,2) or DOWN to (5,1) to approach the apples at (1,2), (1,3), and (1,0). The enemy is at (0,8) and might move to (0,7) or (1,8), so it is still far. Secure the bottom apples quickly to catch up in score.\n\nDOWN",

Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (1,0), (7,4), (1,2)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (1,8), body length 23 (22 apples + initial head). Its body: [(0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8)]\n\nPossible moves from (5,2):\n- UP: (5,3) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (5,1) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,2) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,2) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (1,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (1,9) - This is its own body (third segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,7) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (0,8) - This is its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (2,8) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN to (1,7) and RIGHT to (2,8).\n\nLong-term plan: You need to collect apples to catch up (21 vs 22). The apples at (1,2), (1,3), (1,0), and (0,4) are in the bottom-left. The apple at (7,4) is also available but farther.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,1) gets you closer to (1,0) and (1,2). From (5,1), you can go LEFT to (4,1) or DOWN to (5,0) (safe? (5,0) is free) or RIGHT to (6,1) (but (6,1) is your body). Actually, (6,1) is your body segment (second to last). So RIGHT from (5,1) is unsafe. So DOWN to (5,1) would have safe moves: DOWN (5,0) and LEFT (4,1).\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,2) gets you closer to the bottom-left apples. From (4,2), safe moves: UP (4,3) safe, DOWN (4,1) safe, LEFT (3,2) safe, RIGHT (5,2) unsafe (your head was there). So three safe moves.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,2) moves you away from the bottom apples and towards the right. From (6,2), safe moves: UP (6,3) unsafe (your body), DOWN (6,1) unsafe (your body), LEFT (5,2) unsafe (your head was there), RIGHT (7,2) safe. So only one safe move (RIGHT). This is risky as it leads to a dead-end.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is not good.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT:\n- DOWN to (5,1) has two safe follow-ups (DOWN and LEFT).\n- LEFT to (4,2) has three safe follow-ups.\n\nLEFT is better for future options.\n\nAlso, the apple at (1,2) is at y=2, same as your current y. Moving LEFT to (4,2) puts you at the same y-level and closer to (1,2). Then you can continue LEFT to (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) to eat it.\n\nEnemy is at (1,8) and might move DOWN to (1,7) or RIGHT to (2,8). It is still far from the bottom apples. You have time to secure (1,2) and then (1,3) or (1,0).\n\nTherefore, choose LEFT to (4,2).\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving LEFT to (4,2), continue LEFT to (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) to eat the apple. Then consider going DOWN to (1,1) and (1,0) for another apple, or UP to (1,3) for the third apple. Avoid moving into your own body and watch for enemy movements.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, after I move, tail stays at (3, 7) unless I eat an apple. So (1, 7) will be empty next turn. Actually (1, 7) will be empty because my body moves forward.

Next turn, go DOWN again to (1, 5) if safe, then (1, 4), aiming for apple at (1, 3).  \nEnemy may try to cut me off from left side, but I\u2019m closer.  \nIf enemy goes for (7, 4), I can secure bottom apples and maintain lead.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nI\u2019m heading down column 1 toward apples (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0). Enemy at (4, 2) may move left toward same apples. Next turn from (1, 6), if DOWN (1, 5) is safe, take it. If not, consider LEFT or RIGHT to avoid trap. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s possible path to (1, 3) \u2014 they could go (4, 2) \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 2) in 3 moves. I need 3 moves to (1, 3) from (1, 6): (1, 5) \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 (1, 3). Race is tight. Possibly next turn I might need to go LEFT or RIGHT if enemy gets too close to head-on collision at (1, 3) area.\n\nDOWN",

Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (1,0), (7,4), (1,2)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (1,6), body length 23 (22 apples + initial head). Its body: [(1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7)]\n\nPossible moves from (3,2):\n- UP: (3,3) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (3,1) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,2) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,2) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (1,6). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (1,7) - This is its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,5) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (0,6) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,6) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6), RIGHT to (2,6).\n\nLong-term plan: You need to collect apples to catch up (21 vs 22). The apples at (1,2), (1,3), (1,0), and (0,4) are in the bottom-left. The apple at (7,4) is also available but farther.\n\nMoving LEFT to (2,2) gets you closer to (1,2). From (2,2), you can continue LEFT to (1,2) to eat the apple. This is a direct path.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) gets you closer to (1,0) but slightly away from (1,2). From (3,1), safe moves would be DOWN (3,0) safe, LEFT (2,1) safe, RIGHT (4,1) unsafe (your body). So two safe moves.\n\nMoving UP to (3,3) moves you away from the bottom apples and towards (1,3) but not directly. From (3,3), safe moves: UP (3,4) safe, DOWN (3,2) unsafe (your head was there), LEFT (2,3) safe, RIGHT (4,3) unsafe (your body). So two safe moves.\n\nLEFT is the best because it directly progresses towards (1,2) and has good follow-up options. After (2,2), you can go LEFT to (1,2) to eat the apple. Then you can go DOWN to (1,1) and (1,0) for another apple, or UP to (1,3) for the third apple.\n\nEnemy is at (1,6) and might move DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6), or RIGHT to (2,6). It is not currently threatening the bottom-left apples. You have a clear path to secure (1,2) and then others.\n\nTherefore, choose LEFT to (2,2).\n\nPlan for next turns: Continue LEFT to (1,2) to eat the apple. Then consider DOWN to (1,1) and (1,0) for the next apple, or UP to (1,3) for another. Avoid moving into your own body and watch for enemy movements.\n\nLEFT",

Your body segments: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)] (21 segments). Total length 22.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (1,0), (7,4), (1,2)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (1,5), body length 23 (22 apples + initial head). Its body: [(1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (4,6)]\n\nPossible moves from (2,2):\n- UP: (2,3) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,1) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (1,2) - This is an apple! Eating it would grow you. Check: enemy head? At (1,5), not here. Enemy body? None. Your body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,2) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLEFT leads directly to an apple at (1,2). This is highly advantageous as it gives you a point (tying the score at 22) and grows your snake.\n\nNow, consider the enemy: Snake #0 is at (1,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (1,6) - This is its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,4) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (0,5) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,5) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN to (1,4), LEFT to (0,5), RIGHT to (2,5).\n\nThe enemy is not threatening (1,2) directly. However, if it moves RIGHT to (2,5), it is closer to the apple at (1,3) or (1,2) but not immediately.\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,2) is the best move because it secures an apple and ties the score. After eating, your head will be at (1,2) and your body will grow by one segment (tail remains at (8,1)). Then you can plan to get the apple at (1,3) or (1,0) next.\n\nUP to (2,3) moves you away from the apples. DOWN to (2,1) gets you closer to (1,0) but not as directly beneficial as LEFT.\n\nTherefore, choose LEFT to (1,2) to eat the apple.\n\nPlan for next turns: After eating the apple at (1,2), you will be at (1,2) with length 23. Then consider going DOWN to (1,1) and (1,0) for the next apple, or UP to (1,3) for another apple. Avoid moving into your own body and watch for enemy movements. The enemy might be competing for (1,3) or (1,0), so act quickly.\n\nLEFT",

Still, risk exists.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 5), enemy going LEFT to (1, 2) doesn\u2019t create immediate collision risk.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 5), no collision risk with enemy\u2019s possible moves.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nFrom (1, 4): safe moves next turn likely DOWN (1, 3), LEFT (0, 4), RIGHT (2, 4) \u2014 three options, but (1, 3) might be contested.  \nFrom (0, 5): safe moves next turn DOWN (0, 4), RIGHT (1, 5) \u2014 two options.  \nFrom (2, 5): safe moves next turn DOWN (2, 4), LEFT (1, 5), RIGHT (3, 5) \u2014 three options, better mobility but away from apples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nI have a 1-apple lead. Priority: stay alive, keep lead, get apples safely.  \nGoing DOWN toward (1, 3) risks head-on collision next turn if enemy moves toward (1, 3).  \nGoing LEFT toward (0, 4) is safer from enemy but fewer future moves.  \nGoing RIGHT gives mobility but delays apple gathering.  \n\nGiven enemy is at (2, 2) and can reach (1, 3) in two moves, I should avoid racing directly there. Better to take LEFT to (0, 5), then go DOWN to (0, 4) for apple, while watching enemy movement. This avoids potential head-on collision at (1, 3) next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nI\u2019m going LEFT to (0, 5) to safely approach apple (0, 4) and avoid possible head-on collision at (1, 3). Next turn, if DOWN to (0, 4) is safe, take it to eat apple and grow. Monitor enemy: if enemy goes to (1, 2), be cautious about moving toward (1, 3) later. Keep lead, avoid risky races.\n\nLEFT",

Total length 23.\n\nApples at: (0,4), (1,3), (1,0), (7,4), (5,1)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (0,5), body length 23 (22 apples + initial head). Its body: [(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]\n\nPossible moves from (1,2):\n- UP: (1,3) - This is an apple! Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (1,1) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (0,2) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,2) - This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nUP leads directly to the apple at (1,3). This would give you a point (making you 23 vs enemy 22) and grow your snake.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (0,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (0,6) - Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (0,4) - This is an apple! Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,5) - Off the board. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,5) - This is its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP to (0,6) and DOWN to (0,4).\n\nThe enemy might move DOWN to (0,4) to eat that apple, but it cannot reach (1,3) this turn. Moving UP to (1,3) secures the apple for you and gives you the lead.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,3), your head will be at (1,3) with length 24. Then you can consider moving to other apples like (1,0) or (0,4) if available.\n\nDOWN to (1,1) gets you closer to (1,0), but UP is more immediately beneficial. LEFT to (0,2) doesn't lead directly to an apple.\n\nTherefore, choose UP to (1,3) to eat the apple and take the lead.\n\nPlan for next turns: After eating, you'll be at (1,3). Then consider DOWN to (1,2) (but careful: your body will be there after growth? Actually, after eating, your tail doesn't move immediately, so (1,2) will be your body next turn) or LEFT to (0,3) to potentially target (0,4) or DOWN to (1,1) for (1,0).

Next turn:  \n- My head at (0, 4), enemy head at (1, 3).  \nPossible collision at (1, 4) or (0, 3) if we both move toward each other next turn, but not immediate.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (0, 2) or DOWN to (1, 1), even less risk.  \n\nUP (0, 6) avoids any possible collision but gives up apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nAfter DOWN to (0, 4) and eating apple:  \nMy new length will be 23 + 1 = 24 segments, tail stays where it is until next move.  \nNext turn from (0, 4): possible moves UP (0, 5) \u2013 currently my neck (1,5) will move away, so (0,5) will be empty by next turn? Wait: after moving to (0,4), my body becomes [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), ... (5,6)]? Let's check: head moves to (0,4), old head (0,5) becomes new second segment, tail (5,6) stays unless apple eaten. Since I ate apple, tail doesn't move, so length increases by 1, so all segments shift: new body: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), ... (5,6), (5,6)? No, duplicate tail? Actually, growth means the tail stays in place, so the segment before tail is duplicated? Let's simplify: after eating, next turn my body will be: head at (0,4), then previous head (0,5), then rest of body except tail stays same. So (0,5) will be my body next turn.  \n\nSo from (0, 4) next turn:  \n- UP (0, 5): my own body \u2192 not safe.  \n- DOWN (0, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT: off board.  \n- RIGHT (1, 4): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn if I go DOWN now. That's okay but limited.  \n\nIf I go UP to (0, 6):  \nNext turn from (0, 6): possible moves UP (0, 7) \u2013 empty, DOWN (0, 5) \u2013 empty after I move, LEFT off, RIGHT (1, 6) \u2013 my body (1,6) will be there? Wait, my body after UP: head (0,6), second (0,5), third (1,5), fourth (1,6)... so (1,6) is body. So RIGHT not safe. So next turn only UP and DOWN safe. That's even worse.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nBoth safe moves lead to only two safe moves next turn.  \nEating apple now gets me to 23 apples vs enemy 22, extends lead to 2 apples if enemy doesn't eat (1,3).  \nEnemy likely eats (1,3) this turn, tying apples at 23 each.  \nSo I should eat (0,4) to stay ahead by 1 apple (23 vs 23 if enemy eats, but if enemy doesn't eat, I'm ahead by 2).  \n\nRisk of going DOWN: minimal immediate collision risk, but next turn only 2 moves. Still, I can go DOWN to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,4) next turn.  \nGoing UP avoids apple, keeps tie if enemy eats apple, and also limits next moves.  \n\nBetter to take apple now and keep lead.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nI ate apple at (0,4), now head at (0,4), body includes (0,5) behind me. Next turn safe moves: DOWN to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,4). Prefer RIGHT to (1,4) to move toward board center and away from left wall trap. Enemy likely at (1,3) after eating apple. Watch for enemy moving to (1,4) same time as me \u2192 possible head-on collision. If risk, choose DOWN instead. Goal: stay ahead, avoid head-on, seek apple (5,1) or (7,4) later.\n\nDOWN",

Not guaranteed.  \nGiven enemy\u2019s body shape, UP (1, 4) is open and moves toward center, so likely.  \nLEFT (0, 3) is also open but moves toward wall near my head.  \nRIGHT (2, 3) is safe and moves toward apples.  \nEnemy might prefer RIGHT to avoid me and go toward apples.  \n\nStill, RIGHT for me has collision risk if enemy chooses UP.  \nDOWN for me has collision risk if enemy chooses LEFT.  \n\nWhich is safer?  \nEnemy\u2019s body is mostly on right side, so moving LEFT might be less appealing (toward confined area).  \nEnemy might prefer UP or RIGHT.  \nThus:  \n- Enemy going LEFT probability lower.  \n- So my DOWN (0, 3) is safer from collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nFrom (0, 3) after DOWN:  \nNext turn moves: UP (0, 4) \u2013 my body? After moving, body: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), ...] so (0, 4) will be my body \u2192 not safe.  \nDOWN (0, 2): empty.  \nLEFT off board.  \nRIGHT (1, 3): enemy\u2019s current head position, but enemy will move away possibly, could be empty next turn unless enemy stays (unlikely). Safer to assume empty.  \nSo next turn likely safe: DOWN, maybe RIGHT.  \n\nFrom (1, 4) after RIGHT:  \nNext turn moves: UP (1, 5) \u2013 my body (1,5) will be there after move \u2192 not safe.  \nDOWN (1, 3) \u2013 enemy\u2019s current head, likely empty next turn.  \nLEFT (0, 4) \u2013 my body (0,4) will be there \u2192 not safe.  \nRIGHT (2, 4) \u2013 empty.  \nSo next turn safe: DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nBoth give 2 safe moves next turn.  \nDOWN keeps me near left edge but away from enemy likely path.  \nRIGHT moves toward center but risks collision this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nGiven enemy likely to avoid LEFT (0, 3) because it\u2019s near my head and wall, DOWN is safer collision-wise.  \nRIGHT risks immediate head-on if enemy goes UP.  \nSince scores are tied (23 each), avoiding death is top priority.  \nChoose DOWN to (0, 3) to survive this turn, then reassess.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 3), check if (1, 3) is empty (enemy likely moved). If empty, consider RIGHT to (1, 3) to move toward apples. If enemy still nearby, maybe DOWN to (0, 2) toward apple (1,0). Keep left column until chance to cut across safely. Enemy likely heading toward (5,1) or (7,4). Try to get to apple (2,7) later via right/up moves when safe.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current state:\n\nYour snake head is at (1, 3). Your body segments: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)] (23 segments). Total length 24 (since you just ate the apple at (1,3)).\n\nApples at: (1,0), (7,4), (5,1), (8,6), (2,7) \u2014 note: (0,4) is gone? Actually, the board shows (0,4) as enemy head? Wait, the apples listed are (1,0), (7,4), (5,1), (8,6), (2,7). But the board state shows:\n- At (0,4): '0' (enemy head)\n- At (1,0): 'A'\n- At (7,4): 'A'\n- At (5,1): 'A'\n- At (8,6): 'A'\n- At (2,7): 'A'\n\nSo apples are at (1,0), (7,4), (5,1), (8,6), (2,7). The apple at (0,4) was likely eaten by the enemy last turn? Because enemy moved to (0,4) to eat it? That explains why enemy now has 23 apples (same as you before you ate (1,3)).\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (0,4). Its body: [(0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)] (23 segments). Length 24? Actually, it just ate (0,4) so it grew to 24? But the score says snake #0 apples: 23? Wait, the scores are \"so far\" \u2014 probably before this turn? Actually, the turn is 115, and last turn was 114. So the scores shown are at the start of turn 115? But you just ate (1,3) so you should be 24? But the score says \"your snake apples: 23\" \u2014 that must be before you ate. Similarly enemy is listed as 23, but it might have eaten (0,4) last turn? Actually, last turn enemy head was at (0,5) and it had safe DOWN to (0,4) which was an apple. So it likely ate it. So enemy should be 24 now? But the score says 23. Perhaps the scores are not updated in the state? Actually, the state says \"Scores so far: your snake apples: 23, snake #0 apples: 23\". This is confusing.\n\nBut from the board, enemy head is at (0,4) which was an apple. So it probably ate it. So both snakes are now at 24 apples? Or wait, you ate (1,3) so you are 24. Enemy ate (0,4) so it is 24. But the scores are not updated? We'll assume both are at 24 now.\n\nNow, possible moves from your head (1,3):\n- UP: (1,4) \u2014 Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN: (1,2) \u2014 This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (0,3) \u2014 Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,3) \u2014 Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN is unsafe because (1,2) is your body.\n\nNow, apples: (1,0) is below, (7,4) is far right, (5,1) is down-right, (8,6) is far right-up, (2,7) is up-right.\n\nEnemy head at (0,4). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (0,5) \u2014 This is its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (0,3) \u2014 Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,4) \u2014 Off board. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,4) \u2014 Check: your body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN to (0,3) and RIGHT to (1,4).\n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (1,4), it might conflict with you if you go UP to (1,4). That would be a head-on collision. So avoid (1,4) if enemy might go there.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (0,3), it might go for (1,0) later.\n\nYour options:\n- UP to (1,4): risky because enemy might go to (1,4) too. If both go, both die. If only one goes, it's safe. But since enemy has two choices, it might avoid (1,4) if it sees risk? But we don't know.\n- LEFT to (0,3): if enemy goes DOWN to (0,3), that would be head-on collision. So also risky.\n- RIGHT to (2,3): safe, and leads towards (5,1) or (7,4).\n\nTo avoid immediate death, we should avoid moves that could cause head-on collision. Since enemy has two moves (DOWN and RIGHT), and both (1,4) and (0,3) are risky, the safest is RIGHT to (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), you can go down to (2,2) (but your body is there? Actually, (2,2) is your body, but next turn your tail might move? After growth, the tail doesn't move immediately when you eat, but since you just ate, your tail will stay for one more move? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow by one, so the tail doesn't move that turn. Then next turn, when you move, the tail moves. So currently, your body is from (1,2) to (8,1). Next turn, if you move, your tail (8,1) will be removed, and you'll add a new head.\n\nSo after moving to (2,3), your body will be: [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), ... , (8,2)? Wait, no: the tail is at (8,1), and it will shift.\n\nBut (2,2) is your body now, but next turn it might be safe? Actually, when you move, the tail moves, so (2,2) will still be there? Only the very tail (8,1) is removed. So (2,2) remains.\n\nSo from (2,3), DOWN to (2,2) would be unsafe next turn.\n\nBut for now, RIGHT to (2,3) is safe.\n\nLong-term: we need to collect apples to reach 30. The closest apples are (1,0) and (5,1). (1,0) is close but requires going down. But (1,2) is your body, so you can't go directly down from (1,3). So to reach (1,0), you need to go left to (0,3) then down to (0,2), (0,1), (0,0)? But (0,0) is bottom left, then (1,0) is right.\n\nAlternatively, go right to (2,3), then down to (2,2) is unsafe, so down-right to (3,2) is your body? (3,2) is your body. So going down is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps go right to (2,3), then up to (2,4) to go towards (2,7) or (8,6).\n\nGiven the risks of head-on collision with enemy at (0,4), the safest move is RIGHT to (2,3).\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (2,3) to avoid potential conflict with enemy. Then next turn, consider UP to (2,4) or RIGHT to (3,3) to approach apples (2,7) or (7,4). Monitor enemy movement \u2014 it might go to (0,3) or (1,4). If it goes to (0,3), it might target (1,0). We can try to get (5,1) or (7,4) later.\n\nRIGHT",

It cannot harm you directly this turn.\n\nApples: (1,0), (7,4), (5,1), (8,6), (2,7). The closest are (2,7) and (5,1).\n\nFrom your head (2,3):\n- UP to (2,4) moves towards (2,7) and opens paths to the top.\n- RIGHT to (3,3) moves towards (7,4) and (8,6), but also towards (5,1) via down later.\n\nBoth moves are safe. However, UP is more direct towards (2,7), which is closer. Also, moving UP avoids the crowded lower area where your body is. After moving UP, you can continue north to collect (2,7) and then possibly (8,6).\n\nLong-term: Both snakes have 24 apples (since scores shown are pre-last-eat). We need to reach 30. Enemy is trapped in the bottom-left and must go down to (0,2), then it might target (1,0). We can focus on the upper apples: (2,7), (8,6), and (7,4). Plan to go UP to (2,4), then likely UP again to (2,5) and (2,6) to get (2,7). Then head east for (7,4) and (8,6). Avoid getting boxed in by your own body.\n\nUP",

Wait, enemy head is at (2, 3) now, not (1, 3). (1, 3) is empty (from board: row 3 col 1 is 'T'? Let\u2019s check board state: row 3: \"0 T 1 ...\" \u2192 col 0 is '0' (my head), col 1 is 'T' (my body), col 2 is '1' (enemy head), col 3 is '.'). So (1, 3) is 'T' \u2014 my own body segment? Let\u2019s verify: my body list: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6)... No (1,3) in my body. But board shows 'T' at (1,3)? Wait, row 3 col 1 is 'T' in board diagram. That means (1,3) is occupied by a snake body. Whose? Snake #1 body: (1,3) is not in its list (head is (2,3), body includes (1,3)? Let\u2019s check enemy body: [(1, 3), (1, 2), ...] Yes! Enemy body first segment after head is (1,3). So (1,3) is enemy body \u2192 moving RIGHT into enemy body \u2192 death. So RIGHT is unsafe.  \n\nSo safe moves: only DOWN (0, 2).  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy snake #1 possible moves**  \nEnemy head: (2, 3)  \nBody: [(1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2)]  \n\nEnemy safe moves:  \n- UP (2, 4): empty '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (2, 2): own body \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT (1, 3): own body \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT (3, 3): empty '.' \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo enemy can only go UP or RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**  \nI can only go DOWN to (0, 2). Enemy cannot go to (0, 2) from (2, 3) in one move. So no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apples and growth**  \nApples: (1, 0), (7, 4), (5, 1), (8, 6), (2, 7)  \nFrom (0, 2) after moving DOWN: closer to apple (1, 0) (distance 2 steps).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nFrom (0, 2) next turn:  \n- UP (0, 3): my body? After moving, my body will be [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), ...] so (0, 3) is my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (0, 1): empty.  \n- LEFT: off board.  \n- RIGHT (1, 2): enemy body? Enemy body includes (1, 2) currently, but enemy will move. If enemy goes UP, (1, 2) stays body; if enemy goes RIGHT, (1, 2) stays body (since body moves forward, tail at (8,2) moves away? Actually enemy length 23, so (1,2) is near head, will move with snake). So (1, 2) will be enemy body next turn \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo next turn only safe move is DOWN (0, 1). That\u2019s a trap.  \n\nBut wait: if enemy goes RIGHT to (3, 3), then enemy\u2019s body shifts: head to (3, 3), body becomes [(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), ...] so (1, 2) is still enemy body (third segment). So yes, (1, 2) stays occupied. If enemy goes UP to (2, 4), body becomes [(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), ...] so (1, 2) still enemy body. So (1, 2) will be enemy body next turn regardless.  \n\nSo from (0, 2) next turn only DOWN is safe \u2192 dead end.  \n\nThat means I must avoid going to (0, 2) if possible \u2014 but I have no other safe move now.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Re-check RIGHT**  \nRIGHT to (1, 3) is enemy body now \u2192 death. So not safe.  \nUP to (0, 4) is my body \u2192 death.  \nLEFT off board \u2192 death.  \n\nSo only DOWN is safe this turn, even though it leads to a bad position next turn.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Plan for next turn**  \nFrom (0, 2) next turn, only DOWN (0, 1) is safe. Then from (0, 1), maybe RIGHT (1, 1) if enemy body clears? Possibly not. This is risky.  \n\nMaybe enemy will eat an apple and grow, keeping (1, 2) occupied longer.  \n\nBut I have no choice this turn. Must survive now.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 2), only safe move is DOWN to (0, 1). Then from (0, 1), check if (1, 1) is free (likely yes unless enemy shifts). Try to move toward apple (1, 0) or (5, 1) by going RIGHT later when safe. If trapped, hope enemy makes mistake first.  \n\nDOWN",

So (1, 2) stays enemy body next turn. (1, 1) should be free. So RIGHT (1, 1) likely safe next turn.  \n\nSo from (0, 1) next turn, safe moves: DOWN (0, 0) and likely RIGHT (1, 1). That\u2019s better than being trapped with only one move.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nFrom (0, 1), go to (1, 1) next turn if safe, then to (1, 0) for apple. That\u2019s the nearest apple.  \nEnemy is far from (1, 0) now.  \nNeed to avoid getting stuck along left wall. After eating apple (1, 0), my tail will grow, so I must plan path to stay alive.  \n\nFor now, only one safe move: DOWN.  \n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s okay because eating apple will grow me, but after eating, from (1, 0) I\u2019ll have to check options.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 1):  \nNext turn from (1, 1):  \n- UP (1, 2): enemy body at (1, 2) currently, but enemy moves this turn. If enemy goes UP to (2, 6), his body shifts: (1, 2) stays enemy body? Let\u2019s check: enemy body list starts with (2, 4) after head moves to (2, 6), so (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2) remains in body. So (1, 2) still enemy body next turn \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (1, 0): apple \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (0, 1): my body after move \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (2, 1): board '.' \u2192 safe (enemy far).  \nSo from (1, 1) next turn, safe moves: DOWN (apple) and RIGHT. That\u2019s 2 safe moves, better mobility.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI want to eat apple (1, 0) soon, but also keep options open.  \nRIGHT to (1, 1) gives me more next-turn choices and still lets me eat apple next turn via DOWN.  \nDOWN to (0, 0) forces me into apple next turn with no alternative.  \n\nGiven enemy is far, I prefer keeping flexibility. So RIGHT seems better.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Check immediate safety of RIGHT**  \n(1, 1) is empty now, no enemy body there, enemy can\u2019t reach it this turn. Safe.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 1), go DOWN to (1, 0) to eat apple unless something changes. That will grow me, then plan path to avoid dead ends (maybe go right toward center).  \n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n- DOWN: (2, 5) \u2014 This is your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1, 6) \u2014 Check: your body? No. Enemy body? Snake #0's body includes (1,6)? Yes, it's the seventh segment. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (3, 6) \u2014 Check: your body? No. Enemy body? No. Safe.\n\nSo only UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (1, 1). Its safe moves (from last turn's analysis): DOWN to (0,0) and RIGHT to (1,1) \u2014 but wait, (1,1) is its own head? Actually, its head is already at (1,1), so RIGHT would be (2,1). Let's recalc for enemy at (1,1):\n- UP: (1, 2) \u2014 Check: your body? Your body has (1,2)? Yes, fifth segment. Unsafe for enemy.\n- DOWN: (1, 0) \u2014 Check: your body? No. Enemy body? No. This cell has an apple! Safe.\n- LEFT: (0, 1) \u2014 This is its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (2, 1) \u2014 Check: your body? No. Enemy body? No. Safe.\n\nSo enemy has DOWN to (1,0) (apple) and RIGHT to (2,1). It cannot harm you directly this turn.\n\nApples: (1,0), (7,4), (5,1), (8,6), (2,7). The closest is (2,7) above you.\n\nFrom your head (2,6):\n- UP to (2,7) collects the apple immediately. This is highly beneficial.\n- RIGHT to (3,6) moves east, away from the apple.\n\nUP is the best choice to collect (2,7) now. This will give you 24 apples, tying with the enemy if it eats (1,0). After eating, we should plan to move east towards (7,4) and (8,6). Avoid moving into your own long body.\n\nLong-term: Both snakes have 23 apples. Eating (2,7) puts us at 24. Enemy might eat (1,0) to also reach 24. We need to race to 30. Our path east is relatively clear, while enemy is in the northwest corner. We have an advantage in accessing the eastern apples.\n\nUP",

Actually growth means tail doesn\u2019t move this turn, but next turn after moving, tail stays same length.  \nNext turn from (1, 0):  \n- UP (1, 1): will be my body (old head position) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT (0, 0): board '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (2, 0): board '.' \u2192 safe.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn: LEFT or RIGHT. That\u2019s okay.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 1):  \nNext turn from (2, 1):  \n- UP (2, 2): enemy body at (2, 2) currently, but enemy moves this turn. If enemy goes UP to (2, 7), their body shifts: (2, 5) becomes new neck, so (2, 2) stays in body (since body is long). Yes, (2, 2) is far back in their body and will remain next turn \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (2, 0): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (1, 1): my body after move \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (3, 1): '.' \u2192 safe.  \nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT (2 safe moves).  \n\nBut going RIGHT delays apple eating, letting enemy possibly get ahead if they eat (2, 7).\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nWe\u2019re tied at 23 apples. Eating (1, 0) now puts me at 24. If enemy eats (2, 7), they also get 24. So tie continues unless I can get another apple soon.  \nAfter eating (1, 0), I can go LEFT to (0, 0) next turn, then maybe up through left side? But left side is crowded with my body along column 0.  \n\nActually, looking at board: my body occupies much of left and top. I need to avoid trapping myself.  \nGoing RIGHT to (2, 1) avoids immediate growth, keeps me more central, and I can target (5, 1) apple later. But enemy is near (2, 7) apple, likely to eat it.  \n\nGiven the scores are tied and game could end at 30 apples, eating now is good, but I must ensure I don\u2019t get trapped after growing.  \n\nCheck: after eating at (1, 0), my body from (0, 1) to (7, 8) remains, so (0, 0) and (2, 0) are free next turn. That\u2019s okay.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Immediate safety of DOWN**  \n(1, 0) is apple, no enemy body there, enemy can\u2019t reach it this turn. Safe.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nEating apple now gives me score advantage if enemy doesn\u2019t eat one (possible if they go LEFT or RIGHT instead of UP).  \nEven if they eat one too, we stay tied, but I\u2019m closer to 30.  \nAlso, eating now grows my length, which could limit enemy\u2019s movement options later (more body to avoid).  \n\nI\u2019ll take the apple.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 0), choose LEFT to (0, 0) or RIGHT to (2, 0) depending on enemy position. Avoid going up into body. Then work toward (5, 1) apple via lower rows.\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (3, 7) \u2014 Check: your body? No. Enemy body? No. Safe.\n\nSo only UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (1, 0).

Closest apple is (5, 1) or (8, 0).  \n(5, 1) is 4 steps away (Manhattan distance).  \n(8, 0) is 7 steps away.  \n(0, 6) is far and blocked by my body in column 0.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each move**  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 0):  \nNext turn from (0, 0):  \n- UP (0, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (1, 0): my old head position (now body) \u2192 unsafe.  \nThat\u2019s zero safe moves next turn \u2192 death trap. So LEFT is actually unsafe in practice because it leaves me with no escape next turn.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 0):  \nNext turn from (2, 0):  \n- UP (2, 1): board '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (2, -1): off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (1, 0): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (3, 0): board '.' \u2192 safe.  \nSo 2 safe moves: UP and RIGHT. That\u2019s viable.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Re-evaluate LEFT**  \nLEFT leads to certain death next turn unless I eat an apple this turn (which I don\u2019t) and grow so tail doesn\u2019t move, but even then:  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 0) without eating apple, tail moves forward one cell (from (7, 8) to (8, 8)? Wait, tail movement: after moving without eating, tail moves from last segment to follow body, so (7, 8) becomes tail? Actually current tail is (7, 8). After moving head to (0, 0) without eating, tail becomes (8, 8) (since body shifts). That doesn\u2019t free up (0, 1) or (1, 0) for next turn. So indeed from (0, 0) all adjacent cells are either off-board or my body next turn.  \nThus LEFT is a death trap \u2192 must eliminate.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Only RIGHT is safe**  \nSo only RIGHT (2, 0) is safe and keeps options open.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nFrom (2, 0), I can go UP to (2, 1) next, moving toward apple (5, 1). Need to watch enemy\u2019s movement \u2014 they may go for (8, 6) or (0, 6).  \nWe\u2019re tied at 24 apples each. Game ends at 30. Need to secure apples while staying safe. My body occupies top and left, so I should maneuver in lower right area where apples (8, 0) and (5, 1) are.  \nEnemy is in upper middle, might go for (8, 6) or (0, 6).  \nI\u2019ll aim for (5, 1) via (2, 0) \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 (3, 1) \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 (5, 1), checking safety each turn.\n\nRIGHT",

Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (3,5) \u2014 Check: your body? Your body segments: (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), ... (2,5) is at (2,5), so (3,5) is not in your body. Enemy body? Snake #0's body: no. Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,6) \u2014 This is your own body (third segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (4,6) \u2014 Check: your body? No. Enemy body? Snake #0's body: no. Safe.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. UP and LEFT are unsafe.\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (3,0). Its safe moves (from current head):\n- UP: (3,1) \u2014 Check: your body? No. Enemy body? Snake #0's body includes (3,1)? No. Safe.\n- DOWN: (3,-1) \u2014 Off the board. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (2,0) \u2014 This is its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (4,0) \u2014 Check: your body? No. Enemy body? No. Safe.\n\nSo enemy has UP to (3,1) and RIGHT to (4,0). It might go for the apple at (5,1) or (8,0). From (3,0), UP to (3,1) gets closer to (5,1), and RIGHT to (4,0) gets closer to (8,0).\n\nApples: (7,4), (5,1), (8,6), (0,6), (8,0). The closest to you are (7,4) and (8,6). (5,1) is closer to the enemy.\n\nFrom your head (3,6):\n- DOWN to (3,5) moves south, which is closer to (7,4) (since (7,4) is south-east).\n- RIGHT to (4,6) moves east, which is also towards (7,4) and (8,6).\n\nBoth moves are good. However, DOWN is slightly better because it reduces the y-distance to (7,4) (from y=6 to y=5, while (7,4) is at y=4). RIGHT keeps you at y=6, which is farther.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: From (3,5), you can go DOWN to (3,4) or RIGHT to (4,5) to approach (7,4). From (4,6), you can go DOWN to (4,5) or RIGHT to (5,6). Both have good options.\n\nBut note: the enemy is moving towards (5,1) or (8,0). (5,1) is at (5,1), which is near your path. If you go RIGHT to (4,6), you might be closer to the enemy's path if it goes UP to (3,1) and then east. However, the enemy is far away (at y=0) and you are at y=6, so immediate collision risk is low.\n\nPrioritize getting to (7,4) quickly. DOWN is more direct.\n\nLong-term: Both snakes have 24 apples. We need to race to 30. Our path south-east is clear. Next turn, from (3,5), we can continue south or east. Avoid moving west into your body.\n\nPlan: Move south to (3,5) to approach (7,4). Then next turn, go to (3,4) or (4,5). Monitor enemy movement. Enemy might take (5,1) and then (8,0), while we take (7,4) and then (8,6). Stay away from enemy head.\n\nDOWN is the best choice to get closer to (7,4).\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (3,4) \u2014 Check: your body? Your body segments: (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), ... (2,4) is at (2,4), so (3,4) is not in your body. Enemy body? Snake #0's body: no. Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,5) \u2014 This is your own body (fifth segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (4,5) \u2014 Check: your body? No. Enemy body? Snake #0's body: no. Safe.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. UP and LEFT are unsafe.\n\nApples: (7,4), (5,1), (8,6), (0,6), (8,0). The closest to you are (7,4) and (8,6). (7,4) is at (7,4) and (8,6) is at (8,6).\n\nFrom your head (3,5):\n- DOWN to (3,4) moves south, which reduces the y-distance to (7,4) (from y=5 to y=4, and (7,4) is at y=4). This also moves you closer to (7,4) in terms of Manhattan distance: from |3-7|+|5-4|=5 to |3-7|+|4-4|=4.\n- RIGHT to (4,5) moves east, which reduces the x-distance to (7,4) (from x=3 to x=4) but keeps y=5. Manhattan distance: |3-7|+|5-4|=5 to |4-7|+|5-4|=4.\n\nBoth moves reduce the Manhattan distance to (7,4) by 1. However, DOWN is slightly better because it aligns your y-coordinate with (7,4) (both at y=4), making it easier to move east directly toward it.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake #0 head at (4,0). It has safe moves UP to (4,1) and RIGHT to (5,0) (since LEFT to (3,0) is its own body). It is likely going for the apple at (5,1) or (8,0). It is far from you (y=0 vs your y=5), so immediate collision risk is low.\n\nLong-term plan: We have 24 apples, same as enemy. We need to race to 30. Our target should be (7,4) first, then (8,6). From (3,5), DOWN to (3,4) is a good step. Then next turn, from (3,4), we can go RIGHT to (4,4) or DOWN to (3,3) to continue toward (7,4). RIGHT to (4,5) is also good, but then we are at (4,5) which is slightly farther from (7,4) in y-direction.\n\nAlso, note that the board has an apple at (0,6) which is far, and (8,0) which the enemy might take. We should focus on the closer apples.\n\nDOWN is the best choice to efficiently approach (7,4).\n\nDOWN",

From (5, 1) I could go UP (5, 2) \u2014 enemy body at (5, 2) \u2192 unsafe, so that\u2019s blocked. Could go LEFT (4, 1) \u2014 my new body after growth? Need to check: after eating, my tail stays where it is for one more move, so (4, 1) might be occupied by my old head \u2014 actually careful: if I move from (4, 1) to (5, 1) eating apple, my head moves to (5, 1), my old head becomes new body segment at (4, 1), tail doesn\u2019t move. So from (5, 1), moves: UP (5, 2) enemy body, DOWN (5, 0) my body, LEFT (4, 1) my new body, RIGHT (6, 1) board '.' \u2192 only RIGHT safe. That\u2019s risky.  \n\nIf I eat apple (5, 1) next turn from (5, 0) going UP to (5, 1), then from (5, 1): UP (5, 2) enemy body, DOWN (5, 0) my body, LEFT (4, 1) board '.' (since my old head was at (5, 0), not (4, 1)), RIGHT (6, 1) board '.' \u2192 2 safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT. That\u2019s better.  \n\nSo eating apple from (5, 0) \u2192 (5, 1) gives more options after eating than eating from (4, 1) \u2192 (5, 1).  \n\nThus RIGHT now is better for post-apple mobility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo RIGHT now to (5, 0), then next turn go UP to (5, 1) to eat apple. After eating, from (5, 1) consider LEFT to (4, 1) or RIGHT to (6, 1) depending on enemy position.  \n\nRIGHT",

Getting to 25 first gives a lead.  \nAfter eating apple (5, 1), aim for (8, 0) or (7, 4) depending on enemy movement.  \nKeep an eye on enemy\u2019s long body \u2014 avoid getting encircled.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gives immediate apple, safe, and keeps future options.  \nRIGHT avoids apple but is also safe.  \nGiven the race to 30, taking apple now is better.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo UP to (5, 1) to eat apple. Next turn from (5, 1), choose LEFT or RIGHT based on enemy\u2019s new head position and board state.  \n\nUP",

Your body segments: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), ... (2,3) is at (2,3), so (3,3) is not in your body. Enemy body? Snake #0's body: no.

UP and LEFT are unsafe.\n\nApples: (7,4), (5,1), (8,6), (0,6), (8,0). The closest is (7,4) at (7,4). From your head (3,4):\n- DOWN to (3,3) moves south, which increases the y-distance to (7,4) (from y=4 to y=3, and (7,4) is at y=4).

Manhattan distance: |3-7|+|4-4|=4 to |4-7|+|4-4|=3.\n\nRIGHT is clearly better for approaching (7,4). Also, RIGHT moves you toward other apples like (8,6) and avoids going south which might lead to dead ends.\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (5,0). It has safe moves UP to (5,1) (where there is an apple) or RIGHT to (6,0) or LEFT to (4,0) (but LEFT is its own body). It will likely go UP to (5,1) to eat the apple. This is far from you (y=0 vs y=4), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nLong-term plan: We need to reach 30 apples. We are at 24, same as enemy. We should target (7,4) first, then (8,6). From (3,4), RIGHT to (4,4) is optimal. Then next turn, we can go RIGHT again to (5,4) or UP to (4,5) to continue toward (7,4). Avoid going south as it moves away from the apples.\n\nRIGHT is the best choice to efficiently approach (7,4) and keep future options open.\n\nRIGHT",

          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "Looking at the current state:\n\nYour head is at (4,4). Let's evaluate the four moves:\n\n- UP: (4,5) - Check: Your body? Your body segments: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7). (4,5) is not in this list. Enemy body? Snake #0's body: (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9). (4,5) is not there. Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,3) - Check: Your body? Not in your body list. Enemy body? Not in snake #0's body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,4) - Check: Your body? This is your first body segment (directly behind head). Moving backwards into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (5,4) - Check: Your body? Your body has (5,2), (5,3), but not (5,4). Enemy body? Snake #0's body: no (5,4). Safe.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nApples: (7,4), (8,6), (0,6), (8,0), (9,5). The closest is (7,4) at (7,4). From (4,4):\n- UP to (4,5): Manhattan distance to (7,4): |4-7|+|5-4|=3+1=4\n- DOWN to (4,3): |4-7|+|3-4|=3+1=4\n- RIGHT to (5,4): |5-7|+|4-4|=2+0=2\n\nRIGHT is clearly best for approaching (7,4). Also, RIGHT moves you toward other apples like (8,6) and (9,5).\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (5,1). It has safe moves: UP to (5,2) (but (5,2) is your body? Actually your body has (5,2) - so if it moves UP it would hit your body and die. Alternatively, it might go RIGHT to (6,1) or LEFT to (4,1) (but LEFT is its own body at (4,0)? Actually its body is (5,0), (4,0), etc. So LEFT to (4,1) is safe? Check: (4,1) is not in its body. So enemy might go UP (into your body and die), RIGHT (to (6,1)), or LEFT (to (4,1)). It might avoid UP since it sees your body. So likely it goes RIGHT or LEFT. This is far from you (y=1 vs y=4), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nLong-term plan: We are at 24 apples, enemy at 25. We need to reach 30. Target (7,4) first, then (8,6) or (9,5). From (4,4), RIGHT to (5,4) is optimal. Next turn, we can go RIGHT to (6,4) (which is safe? Check: (6,4) is your body? Actually your body has (6,4) as the 18th segment. So (6,4) is occupied by your own body! So we cannot go RIGHT again next turn. This is critical.\n\nAfter RIGHT to (5,4), our next moves:\n- From (5,4): UP to (5,5) - check: your body? Not currently occupied. DOWN to (5,3) - your body has (5,3) (16th segment). So DOWN is unsafe. LEFT to (4,4) - but that would be backwards into our new head? Actually after moving, our body will be: head at (5,4), then (4,4) becomes neck, etc. So LEFT to (4,4) is our own neck - safe? But wait: the rule says \"moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself\". So if we move LEFT from (5,4) to (4,4), that is the neck cell, which is directly behind the head. So it is fatal. So LEFT is unsafe. RIGHT to (6,4) - but (6,4) is our body (18th segment). So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nSo from (5,4), only UP is safe. This is a potential trap. We need to avoid getting stuck.\n\nTherefore, we should consider alternatives to RIGHT. UP and DOWN are also safe and might keep more options open.\n\nUP to (4,5): From there, we can go:\n- UP to (4,6): check your body? (3,6) is body, but (4,6) is free.\n- DOWN to (4,4): but that would be backwards? Actually after moving, head at (4,5), neck at (4,4). So DOWN to (4,4) is directly backwards - fatal.\n- LEFT to (3,5): your body (second segment) - unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (5,5): free.\n\nSo from (4,5), UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\nDOWN to (4,3): From there:\n- UP to (4,4): backwards? Head at (4,3), neck at (4,4). So UP is backwards - fatal.\n- DOWN to (4,2): your body has (4,2) (14th segment) - unsafe.\n- LEFT to (3,3): free? Your body: (2,3) is there, but (3,3) is free.\n- RIGHT to (5,3): your body (16th segment) - unsafe.\n\nSo only LEFT is safe from (4,3). This is very restrictive.\n\nTherefore, UP is better than DOWN because it gives two safe moves (UP and RIGHT) next turn, while DOWN gives only one (LEFT). RIGHT leads to only one safe move (UP) next turn.\n\nSo UP is the best choice to keep options open. Also, UP moves us toward (8,6) and (9,5) which are in the north-east.\n\nWe should avoid RIGHT because it leads to a dead end next turn (only UP safe). Instead, go UP to (4,5), then we can go RIGHT to (5,5) or UP to (4,6) to continue toward apples.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (4,5) to maintain flexibility. Then next turn, consider moving RIGHT to (5,5) to approach (7,4) or (8,6). Avoid getting trapped.\n\nUP",

Your body segments: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7). (4,6) is not in this list. Enemy body? Snake #0's body: (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9). (4,6) is not there. Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,4) - Check: This is your neck (directly behind head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (3,5) - Check: Your body? This is your third segment. Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (5,5) - Check: Your body? Your body has (5,2), (5,3), but not (5,5). Enemy body? Snake #0's body: no (5,5). Safe.\n\nSo only UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\nApples: (7,4), (8,6), (0,6), (8,0), (9,5). The closest is (7,4) at (7,4). From (4,5):\n- UP to (4,6): Manhattan distance to (7,4): |4-7|+|6-4|=3+2=5\n- RIGHT to (5,5): |5-7|+|5-4|=2+1=3\n\nRIGHT is closer to (7,4). Also, (8,6) and (9,5) are further right/up.\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (6,1). It has safe moves: UP to (6,2) (free), DOWN to (6,0) (its own body at (5,0)? Actually (6,0) is free? Check: its body has (5,0) but not (6,0). So DOWN is safe. LEFT to (5,1) (its own neck) - fatal. RIGHT to (7,1) (free). So enemy can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. It might move toward apples at (8,0) or (0,6). This is far from you (y=1 vs y=5), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nNext turn considerations:\n- If we go RIGHT to (5,5): From there, we can go UP to (5,6) (free), DOWN to (5,4) (your body? (5,4) is not currently in your body, but after moving to (5,5), the neck is (4,5), so DOWN to (5,4) is not backwards? Actually, head at (5,5), neck at (4,5). So DOWN to (5,4) is not directly behind; it's safe if not occupied. But check: your body has (5,3) and (5,2), but not (5,4). So DOWN is safe. LEFT to (4,5) (neck) - fatal. RIGHT to (6,5) (your body has (6,5) - unsafe). So from (5,5), UP and DOWN are safe.\n- If we go UP to (4,6): From there, we can go UP to (4,7) (free), DOWN to (4,5) (neck) - fatal, LEFT to (3,6) (your body) - unsafe, RIGHT to (5,6) (free). So from (4,6), UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\nBoth moves give two safe options next turn. RIGHT is better for approaching apples (7,4) and (8,6). Also, going RIGHT avoids potential conflicts with your own body in the future.\n\nLong-term: We are at 24 apples, enemy at 25. We need to reach 30. Target (7,4) first, then (8,6) or (9,5). Moving RIGHT now gets us closer.\n\nRIGHT is the best choice.\n\nRIGHT",

(5,6) is not in this list. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (5,6). Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,4) - Check: Your body? (5,4) is not currently in your body (last segment is (6,6)). Enemy body: no (5,4). Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,5) - Check: This is your neck (directly behind head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (6,5) - Check: Your body? Your body has (6,5) (the 21st segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\nApples: (7,4), (8,6), (0,6), (8,0), (9,5).

(7,0) is within 0-9, and not in its body: its body has (6,1), (5,1), etc., no (7,0)), LEFT to (6,1) (neck) - fatal, RIGHT to (8,1) (free). So enemy can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. It might target (8,0) which is close to it. This is far from you (y=1 vs y=5), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nNext turn considerations:\n- If we go DOWN to (5,4): From there, we can go UP to (5,5) (neck) - fatal, DOWN to (5,3) (your body has (5,3) - unsafe), LEFT to (4,4) (your body) - unsafe, RIGHT to (6,4) (your body has (6,4) - unsafe). So only UP and DOWN are fatal or unsafe? Actually, check: after moving to (5,4), the neck becomes (5,5). So:\n  - UP to (5,5) is backwards (neck) - fatal.\n  - DOWN to (5,3) is in your body (the 17th segment) - unsafe.\n  - LEFT to (4,4) is in your body (2nd segment) - unsafe.\n  - RIGHT to (6,4) is in your body (20th segment) - unsafe.\nSo from (5,4), no safe moves? This is a dead end. We must avoid this.\n\n- If we go UP to (5,6): From there, we can go UP to (5,7) (free), DOWN to (5,5) (neck) - fatal, LEFT to (4,6) (free? your body has (3,6) but not (4,6)), RIGHT to (6,6) (your body has (6,6) - unsafe). So from (5,6), UP and LEFT are safe.\n\nTherefore, DOWN leads to a dead end (no safe moves next turn), while UP gives two safe options.\n\nLong-term: We are at 24 apples, enemy at 25. We need to reach 30. Avoid traps. DOWN kills us next turn, so we must choose UP.\n\nUP is the only safe move that keeps us alive.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (5,6), we can go UP to (5,7) or LEFT to (4,6). Target apples (8,6) and (9,5) are to the right/up. We need to maneuver around our body to reach them. Avoid moving into our own body segments.\n\nUP",

Let's evaluate the four moves:\n\n- UP: (5,7) - Check: Your body segments: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6)]. (5,7) is not in this list. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (5,7). Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,5) - Check: This is your neck (directly behind head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (4,6) - Check: Your body? (4,6) is not currently in your body (your body has (3,6) but not (4,6)). Enemy body: no (4,6). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,6) - Check: Your body? Your body has (7,6) but not (6,6)? Actually, your body list ends with (7,6), so (6,6) is free? Wait, your body segments are: head (5,6), then (5,5), (4,5), ... (7,6). (6,6) is not listed. However, note that your last move was UP from (5,5) to (5,6), so the tail should have moved? Actually, the body length is 24 segments (head + 23 body segments) because you have 24 apples. So the tail is at (7,6). Therefore, (6,6) is not occupied. But wait: the board state shows your snake with head at (5,6) and body segments. Looking at the board: at (6,6) it is '.' meaning empty. So RIGHT to (6,6) is safe? However, check enemy: Snake #0's body has no (6,6). So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe. DOWN is unsafe (backwards).\n\nNow, apples: (7,4), (8,6), (0,6), (8,0), (9,5). From (5,6):\n- UP to (5,7): distances: to (8,6)=|5-8|+|7-6|=3+1=4; to (9,5)=|5-9|+|7-5|=4+2=6.\n- LEFT to (4,6): distances: to (0,6)=|4-0|+|6-6|=4+0=4; to (7,4)=|4-7|+|6-4|=3+2=5.\n- RIGHT to (6,6): distances: to (8,6)=|6-8|+|6-6|=2+0=2; to (9,5)=|6-9|+|6-5|=3+1=4.\n\nRIGHT is closest to (8,6) (distance 2) and also close to (9,5).\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (8,1). It can move UP to (8,2), DOWN to (8,0) (which is an apple), LEFT to (7,1) (neck - fatal), or RIGHT to (9,1). So it will likely go DOWN to (8,0) to eat the apple or UP/RIGHT. This is far from you (y=1 vs y=6), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nNext turn considerations:\n- If we go RIGHT to (6,6): From there, we can go UP to (6,7) (free), DOWN to (6,5) (your body has (6,5) - unsafe), LEFT to (5,6) (neck) - fatal, RIGHT to (7,6) (your body has (7,6) - unsafe). So only UP is safe. This is a dead end (only one safe move).\n- If we go UP to (5,7): From there, we can go UP to (5,8) (free), DOWN to (5,6) (neck) - fatal, LEFT to (4,7) (free), RIGHT to (6,7) (free). So three safe moves.\n- If we go LEFT to (4,6): From there, we can go UP to (4,7) (free), DOWN to (4,5) (your body has (4,5) - unsafe), LEFT to (3,6) (your body has (3,6) - unsafe), RIGHT to (5,6) (neck) - fatal. So only UP is safe. This is a dead end.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT and LEFT lead to dead ends (only one safe move next turn), while UP gives three safe options.\n\nLong-term: We are at 24 apples, enemy at 25. We need to reach 30. Avoid traps. UP keeps the most options open and moves towards the apples in the top-right (8,6) and (9,5). From (5,7) we can then go right/up to approach them.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (5,7), we can go UP to (5,8), LEFT to (4,7), or RIGHT to (6,7). Target apples (8,6) and (9,5) are to the right/up. We should aim to move rightwards gradually while avoiding our body. Our body is mostly on the left and bottom, so the top-right is clearer.\n\nUP is the best move for safety and future flexibility.\nUP",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Looking at the current state:\n\nYour head is at (5,7). Let's evaluate the four moves:\n\n- UP: (5,8) - Check: Your body segments: [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5)]. (5,8) is not in this list. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (5,8). Board is 10x10, so (5,8) is within bounds (y=8). Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,6) - Check: This is your neck (directly behind head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (4,7) - Check: Your body? (4,7) is not currently in your body (your body has (3,7) but not (4,7)). Enemy body: no (4,7). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,7) - Check: Your body? Your body has (6,5) and (7,5) but not (6,7). Enemy body: no (6,7). Safe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe. DOWN is unsafe.\n\nNow, apples: (7,4), (8,6), (0,6), (8,0), (9,5). From (5,7):\n- UP to (5,8): distances: to (8,6)=|5-8|+|8-6|=3+2=5; to (9,5)=|5-9|+|8-5|=4+3=7.\n- LEFT to (4,7): distances: to (0,6)=|4-0|+|7-6|=4+1=5; to (7,4)=|4-7|+|7-4|=3+3=6.\n- RIGHT to (6,7): distances: to (8,6)=|6-8|+|7-6|=2+1=3; to (9,5)=|6-9|+|7-5|=3+2=5.\n\nRIGHT is closest to (8,6) (distance 3) and also close to (9,5).\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (9,1). It can move UP to (9,2), DOWN to (9,0) (off-board - fatal), LEFT to (8,1) (neck - fatal), or RIGHT to (10,1) (off-board - fatal). So it has only one safe move: UP to (9,2). This means it will likely go UP, away from the apples at (8,0) and (9,5). Note: (8,0) is an apple, but it cannot reach it safely this turn. So enemy is moving to (9,2).\n\nNext turn considerations:\n- If we go RIGHT to (6,7): From there, we can go UP to (6,8) (free), DOWN to (6,6) (free - not in body), LEFT to (5,7) (neck - fatal), RIGHT to (7,7) (free). So three safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). This is good.\n- If we go UP to (5,8): From there, we can go UP to (5,9) (free), DOWN to (5,7) (neck - fatal), LEFT to (4,8) (free), RIGHT to (6,8) (free). So three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Also good.\n- If we go LEFT to (4,7): From there, we can go UP to (4,8) (free), DOWN to (4,6) (free - not in body), LEFT to (3,7) (your body has (3,7) - unsafe), RIGHT to (5,7) (neck - fatal). So only two safe moves (UP and DOWN). This is less flexible.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT and UP both give three safe moves next turn, while LEFT gives only two. RIGHT is closer to the apples (8,6) and (9,5). Also, moving rightwards helps us avoid our own body which is concentrated on the left.\n\nLong-term: We are at 24 apples, enemy at 25. We need to reach 30. The enemy is trapped in the top-left corner (head at (9,1) and only one move to (9,2)), so it has limited options. We should capitalize by going for the apples in the top-right. RIGHT moves us directly towards (8,6) and (9,5). From (6,7), we can then go UP to (6,8) and then RIGHT to (7,8) and so on, approaching the apples safely.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (6,7), we can move UP/RIGHT to target (8,6) and (9,5). Avoid moving into our body which is below and left. The enemy is constrained and unlikely to interfere. We should aim to eat these apples quickly to catch up and surpass the enemy.\n\nRIGHT is the best move for progress towards apples and maintaining flexibility.\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s check: my tail is at (3, 9), so (8, 1) will still be body next turn because I didn\u2019t eat apple last turn, so body shifts forward but (8, 1) remains occupied until I eat an apple and grow). Actually, if I move UP now, my body shifts: head to (9, 3), (9, 2) becomes new body segment, tail (3, 9) disappears. So (8, 1) stays occupied. That means path to (8, 0) via LEFT then DOWN is blocked next turn. So (8, 0) is not reachable quickly from LEFT now.  \n\nBetter to aim for (9, 5) via UP.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each move**  \n\nIf I go UP to (9, 3):  \nFrom (9, 3) next turn:  \n- UP (9, 4): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (9, 2): my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (8, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT).  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 2):  \nFrom (8, 2) next turn:  \n- UP (8, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (8, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (7, 2): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (9, 2): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT).  \n\nBoth give 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat next turn**  \nEnemy at (6, 7) could move toward (8, 6) apple or (0, 6) apple.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (7, 7), then next turn could threaten (8, 6) area. That\u2019s near (9, 5) path.  \nBut enemy is far from (9, 5) for now.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI have 25 apples, enemy 24. Need 30 to win.  \nGoing UP now gets me closer to (9, 5) apple (2 moves away).  \nGoing LEFT now gets me closer to (7, 4) apple but path may be blocked by my own body in next moves.  \nAlso, (9, 5) is safer because enemy is far and I can eat it and then have options to go left/down from (9, 5) after.  \nUP seems better for apple proximity with less body blockage risk.\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP toward (9, 5) apple, keeping options open.\n\nUP",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Looking at the current state:\n\nYour head is at (6,7). Let's evaluate the four moves:\n\n- UP: (6,8) - Check: Your body segments: [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]. (6,8) is not in this list. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (6,8). Board is 10x10, so (6,8) is within bounds (y=8). Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,6) - Check: Your body? (6,6) is not currently in your body (your body has (5,6) and (6,5) but not (6,6)). Enemy body: no (6,6). Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,7) - Check: This is your neck (directly behind head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,7) - Check: Your body? Your body has no (7,7). Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (7,7). Safe.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, apples: (7,4), (8,6), (0,6), (8,0), (9,5). From (6,7):\n- UP to (6,8): distances: to (8,6)=|6-8|+|8-6|=2+2=4; to (9,5)=|6-9|+|8-5|=3+3=6.\n- DOWN to (6,6): distances: to (7,4)=|6-7|+|6-4|=1+2=3; to (8,6)=|6-8|+|6-6|=2+0=2.\n- RIGHT to (7,7): distances: to (8,6)=|7-8|+|7-6|=1+1=2; to (9,5)=|7-9|+|7-5|=2+2=4.\n\nDOWN is closest to (8,6) (distance 2) and also close to (7,4). RIGHT is also close to (8,6) (distance 2) and (9,5).\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (9,2). It can move UP to (9,3) (free), DOWN to (9,1) (neck - fatal), LEFT to (8,2) (free), RIGHT to (10,2) (off-board - fatal). So it has two safe moves: UP and LEFT. It will likely avoid going backwards (DOWN) or off-board (RIGHT). It might move towards the apple at (9,5) via UP, or towards (8,0) via LEFT? But (8,0) is far. It might also try to stay alive.\n\nNext turn considerations:\n- If we go DOWN to (6,6): From there, we can go UP to (6,7) (neck - fatal), DOWN to (6,5) (your body has (6,5) - unsafe), LEFT to (5,6) (your body has (5,6) - unsafe), RIGHT to (7,6) (free). So only one safe move (RIGHT). This is very risky and limits options.\n- If we go UP to (6,8): From there, we can go UP to (6,9) (free), DOWN to (6,7) (neck - fatal), LEFT to (5,8) (free), RIGHT to (7,8) (free). So three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good flexibility.\n- If we go RIGHT to (7,7): From there, we can go UP to (7,8) (free), DOWN to (7,6) (free), LEFT to (6,7) (neck - fatal), RIGHT to (8,7) (free). So three safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good flexibility.\n\nTherefore, DOWN leads to a dead-end with only one safe move next turn, while UP and RIGHT both give three safe moves. UP and RIGHT are better.\n\nLong-term: We are at 24 apples, enemy at 25. We need to reach 30. The enemy is in the top-right corner but has options. We should target the apples at (8,6) and (9,5). From (6,7), going RIGHT to (7,7) puts us closer to these apples (Manhattan distance to (8,6)=2, to (9,5)=4). Going UP to (6,8) is also reasonable (distance to (8,6)=4). However, RIGHT is directly towards the apples and maintains flexibility.\n\nAlso, note that our body is below us, so moving DOWN risks trapping ourselves. Moving UP or RIGHT opens space.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (7,7) to approach (8,6) and (9,5). Next turn, from (7,7), we can go UP to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,7) to get even closer. Avoid moving into our body which is to the left and down. The enemy might be moving towards (9,5) as well, but we are closer and can potentially beat it.\n\nRIGHT is the best move for progress towards apples and maintaining flexibility.\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current state:\n\nYour head is at (7,7). Let's evaluate the four moves:\n\n- UP: (7,8) - Check: Your body segments: [(6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)]. (7,8) is not in this list. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (7,8). Board is 10x10, so (7,8) is within bounds (y=8). Safe.\n- DOWN: (7,6) - Check: Your body? Your body has no (7,6). Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (7,6). Safe.\n- LEFT: (6,7) - Check: This is your neck (directly behind head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (8,7) - Check: Your body? Your body has no (8,7). Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (8,7). Safe.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, apples: (7,4), (8,6), (0,6), (8,0), (9,5). From (7,7):\n- UP to (7,8): distances: to (8,6)=|7-8|+|8-6|=1+2=3; to (9,5)=|7-9|+|8-5|=2+3=5.\n- DOWN to (7,6): distances: to (7,4)=|7-7|+|6-4|=0+2=2; to (8,6)=|7-8|+|6-6|=1+0=1.\n- RIGHT to (8,7): distances: to (8,6)=|8-8|+|7-6|=0+1=1; to (9,5)=|8-9|+|7-5|=1+2=3.\n\nDOWN is closest to (7,4) (distance 2) and (8,6) (distance 1). RIGHT is closest to (8,6) (distance 1) and also close to (9,5) (distance 3). UP is farther.\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (9,3). It can move UP to (9,4) (free), DOWN to (9,2) (neck - fatal), LEFT to (8,3) (free), RIGHT to (10,3) (off-board - fatal). So it has two safe moves: UP and LEFT. It might move towards the apple at (9,5) via UP, or towards (8,0) via LEFT? But (8,0) is far.\n\nNext turn considerations:\n- If we go DOWN to (7,6): From there, we can go UP to (7,7) (neck - fatal), DOWN to (7,5) (free? Check: your body has (6,4) and (5,5) but not (7,5)), LEFT to (6,6) (free? Check: your body has (5,6) and (6,5) but not (6,6)), RIGHT to (8,6) (apple, but also check: free? No enemy body there). So safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Three options.\n- If we go UP to (7,8): From there, we can go UP to (7,9) (free), DOWN to (7,7) (neck - fatal), LEFT to (6,8) (free), RIGHT to (8,8) (free). So three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).\n- If we go RIGHT to (8,7): From there, we can go UP to (8,8) (free), DOWN to (8,6) (apple, free), LEFT to (7,7) (neck - fatal), RIGHT to (9,7) (free). So three safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nAll safe moves give three options next turn. So flexibility is similar.\n\nHowever, going DOWN to (7,6) puts us very close to the apple at (7,4) (distance 2) and (8,6) (distance 1). But note: (8,6) is an apple, and we can reach it next turn from (7,6) by going RIGHT to (8,6). Similarly, from (8,7) we can go DOWN to (8,6) to get the apple.\n\nBut also consider: our body is below us, so moving DOWN might not be ideal for long-term pathing. Moving RIGHT or UP opens more space.\n\nEnemy is at (9,3) and might move UP to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,3). It is also close to (9,5) (distance 2) and might try to get it.\n\nWe are at 24 apples, enemy at 25. We need to catch up. The apples at (8,6) and (9,5) are key. Moving RIGHT to (8,7) puts us at distance 1 from (8,6) and 3 from (9,5). Moving DOWN to (7,6) also puts us at distance 1 from (8,6) and farther from (9,5). However, from (8,7) we can also go RIGHT to (9,7) and then DOWN to (9,6) to approach (9,5).\n\nRIGHT seems better for accessing both apples. Also, it moves us away from our body which is to the left.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (8,7) to be in position to grab (8,6) next turn and then approach (9,5). This also keeps us flexible and avoids moving into our body cluster.\n\nRIGHT\nRIGHT",

From there, possible moves:  \n- LEFT (8, 5): '.' likely safe.  \n- DOWN (9, 4): my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- UP off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only LEFT from (9, 5) after eating. That leads toward center/other apples.  \nBut I must check if (8, 5) is safe next turn after enemy moves. Currently (8, 5) is '.' and enemy can't reach it in 1 move from (7, 7).  \nSo plan: UP now, UP next turn to eat (9, 5), then LEFT to (8, 5) if safe.\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP to get closer to (9, 5) apple and eat it next turn.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current state:\n\nYour head is at (8,7). Let's evaluate the four moves:\n\n- UP: (8,8) - Check: Your body segments: [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3)]. (8,8) is not in this list. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (8,8). Board is 10x10, so (8,8) is within bounds (y=8). Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,6) - Check: This is an apple location. Moving onto an apple is safe (you grow, so you don't collide with your own body). Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (8,6). Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,7) - Check: This is your neck (directly behind head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (9,7) - Check: Your body? Your body has no (9,7). Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (9,7). Board is 10x10, so (9,7) is within bounds (x=9). Safe.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, apples: (7,4), (8,6), (0,6), (8,0), (9,5). From (8,7):\n- DOWN to (8,6): directly eats the apple at (8,6). This gives you 25 apples (tying with enemy) and grows your snake.\n- UP to (8,8): distances: to (9,5)=|8-9|+|8-5|=1+3=4; to (8,6)=|8-8|+|8-6|=0+2=2.\n- RIGHT to (9,7): distances: to (9,5)=|9-9|+|7-5|=0+2=2; to (8,6)=|9-8|+|7-6|=1+1=2.\n\nEating the apple at (8,6) is highly beneficial: it ties the score and grows your snake, making you longer and potentially more threatening. It also removes that apple from the board.\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (9,4). It can move UP to (9,5) (apple, safe), DOWN to (9,3) (neck - fatal), LEFT to (8,4) (free), RIGHT to (10,4) (off-board - fatal). So it has two safe moves: UP and LEFT. It will likely go UP to (9,5) to eat that apple, which would give it 26 apples. If we eat (8,6), we tie at 25, and then we can compete for the remaining apples.\n\nNext turn considerations:\n- If we go DOWN to (8,6) and eat the apple: our new head is at (8,6), and we grow by one segment (so our tail doesn't move). Our body becomes: [head: (8,6), then (8,7), (7,7), ...]. From (8,6), we can go UP to (8,7) (neck - fatal), DOWN to (8,5) (free? Check: your body has (7,7), (6,7), etc. - no (8,5)), LEFT to (7,6) (free? Check: your body has (7,7) but not (7,6)), RIGHT to (9,6) (free). So safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Three options.\n- If we go UP to (8,8): From there, we can go UP to (8,9) (free), DOWN to (8,7) (neck - fatal), LEFT to (7,8) (free), RIGHT to (9,8) (free). Three safe moves.\n- If we go RIGHT to (9,7): From there, we can go UP to (9,8) (free), DOWN to (9,6) (free), LEFT to (8,7) (neck - fatal), RIGHT to (10,7) (off-board - fatal). So only two safe moves (UP and DOWN).\n\nGoing DOWN to eat the apple gives three safe moves and immediate growth. Going RIGHT only gives two safe moves (since RIGHT is off-board) and doesn't get an apple.\n\nLong-term: After eating (8,6), we can then target (9,5) or (7,4). The enemy will likely eat (9,5) this turn, so we need to catch up. Eating (8,6) now is crucial to tie the score and position ourselves near (9,5) for next turn.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (8,6) to eat the apple and tie the score at 25. Then next turn, we can move towards (9,5) or (7,4) depending on the enemy's position.\n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s risky but currently (8, 5) is '.' and enemy can't reach it in 1 move from (8, 7) unless enemy goes RIGHT to (9, 7) then DOWN 2? No, 1 move only. So (8, 5) should be safe next turn.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 4):  \nFrom (8, 4):  \n- UP (8, 5): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (8, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (7, 4): apple \u2192 safe (eat next turn).  \n- RIGHT (9, 4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT), one leads to apple (7, 4) next turn.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat next turn**  \nEnemy likely goes DOWN to (8, 6) to eat apple, reaching 25 apples (tie with me if I don\u2019t eat now).  \nIf enemy eats (8, 6), its head will be at (8, 6) next turn, body longer.  \nFrom (8, 6) enemy could threaten (8, 5) or (7, 6) etc.  \nIf I go UP now, I eat (9, 5) \u2192 26 apples, enemy eats (8, 6) \u2192 25 apples.  \nThen next turn I must go LEFT to (8, 5), which is adjacent to enemy head at (8, 6) \u2014 that\u2019s dangerous because enemy could move LEFT to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (9, 6) or UP/DOWN, but (8, 5) is not directly threatened unless enemy moves LEFT to (7, 6) (not into my cell). Actually, from (8, 6) enemy\u2019s possible moves: UP (8, 7) body, DOWN (8, 5) empty now but would be my head if I go there \u2014 that\u2019s a head-on collision risk if we both choose DOWN/LEFT wrongly. But moves are simultaneous; if I go to (8, 5) and enemy goes DOWN to (8, 5) same turn, we both die. That\u2019s risky.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Alternative plan**  \nMaybe avoid (9, 5) and go LEFT to (8, 4) to eat (7, 4) next turn, staying farther from enemy.  \nFrom (8, 4), next turn I can go LEFT to (7, 4) apple \u2192 26 apples.  \nEnemy likely eats (8, 6) this turn \u2192 25 apples.  \nThen enemy head at (8, 6), me at (7, 4) after eating. That\u2019s safer distance.\n\nBut going UP to (9, 5) gives me apple now, not next turn \u2014 immediate gain, and I stay ahead in apples.  \nThe risk is next turn being forced to (8, 5) with enemy at (8, 6) adjacent.  \nCheck enemy\u2019s possible moves from (8, 6):  \n- UP (8, 7) body  \n- DOWN (8, 5) free  \n- LEFT (7, 6) free  \n- RIGHT (9, 6) free  \n\nIf I go to (8, 5) next turn, enemy could go DOWN to (8, 5) same turn \u2192 collision.  \nBut would enemy choose DOWN? Possibly if it wants (8, 5) or by chance.  \nI can\u2019t predict perfectly, but maybe enemy will avoid moving into a possible collision if it sees risk.  \nGiven I\u2019ll have 26 apples vs enemy 25, enemy might play safe to survive.  \nBut still, being forced to only one move (LEFT to (8, 5)) is dangerous.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nBetter to keep more options.  \nLEFT to (8, 4) gives me two safe moves next turn, and I can still get an apple (7, 4) next turn.  \nThis keeps me flexible and away from enemy\u2019s immediate vicinity.  \nI\u2019ll still be at 25 apples this turn, enemy likely 25 after eating (8, 6).  \nThen next turn I eat (7, 4) \u2192 26, enemy maybe eats something else.  \nThat seems safer.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT to (8, 4) for better future mobility and lower collision risk.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current state:\n\nYour head is at (8,6). Let's evaluate the four moves:\n\n- UP: (8,7) - This is your neck (the segment directly behind your head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (8,5) - Check: Your body segments: [(8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3)]. (8,5) is not in this list. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (8,5). Board is 10x10, so (8,5) is within bounds (y=5). Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,6) - Check: Your body? Your body has (7,7) but not (7,6). Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (7,6). Board is 10x10, so (7,6) is within bounds (x=7). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,6) - Check: Your body? No. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (9,6). Board is 10x10, so (9,6) is within bounds (x=9). Safe.\n\nSo DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe. UP is unsafe.\n\nNow, apples: (7,4), (0,6), (8,0), (9,5), (6,2). From (8,6):\n- DOWN to (8,5): distances: to (7,4)=|8-7|+|5-4|=1+1=2; to (6,2)=|8-6|+|5-2|=2+3=5.\n- LEFT to (7,6): distances: to (7,4)=|7-7|+|6-4|=0+2=2; to (6,2)=|7-6|+|6-2|=1+4=5.\n- RIGHT to (9,6): distances: to (9,5)=|9-9|+|6-5|=0+1=1; to (7,4)=|9-7|+|6-4|=2+2=4.\n\nRIGHT is closest to (9,5), which is an apple. However, note that enemy snake #0's head is at (8,4). It can move UP to (8,5) (free), DOWN to (8,3) (free? Check enemy body: [(9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), ...] - no (8,3)), LEFT to (7,4) (apple, safe), RIGHT to (9,4) (neck - fatal). So enemy has safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. It will likely go LEFT to (7,4) to eat that apple, or UP to (8,5). If it goes UP to (8,5), that is the same cell we are considering for DOWN. If we both move to (8,5), it's a head-on collision and both die. That would be bad since we are tied at 25 apples (so draw) and we want to win.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (8,5) is risky due to potential head-on collision with enemy moving UP. Similarly, moving LEFT to (7,6) is safe but not directly towards an apple. Moving RIGHT to (9,6) is safe and gets us closer to (9,5). However, (9,5) is also reachable by enemy: enemy can go UP from (8,4) to (8,5) and then next turn to (8,6) or (9,5)? Actually, enemy at (8,4) cannot go to (9,5) in one move (diagonal not allowed). To get to (9,5), enemy would need to go UP to (8,5) then RIGHT to (9,5) next turn, or go LEFT to (7,4) and then up? Not efficient.\n\nBut we are at (8,6) and can go RIGHT to (9,6), then next turn DOWN to (9,5) to eat the apple. Enemy would need two moves to get to (9,5) from (8,4): e.g., UP to (8,5) and then RIGHT to (9,5). So we can beat it to (9,5) if we go RIGHT now and then DOWN next turn.\n\nAlso, after going RIGHT to (9,6), we have safe moves: UP to (9,7) (free), DOWN to (9,5) (apple, safe), LEFT to (8,6) (neck - fatal). So two safe moves (UP and DOWN). But DOWN leads to apple.\n\nLong-term: We need to get to 30 apples. Currently both at 25. Eating (9,5) would bring us to 26, and then we can target (7,4) or (6,2). Enemy might eat (7,4) this turn.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (9,6) to position for (9,5) next turn. This avoids the risky (8,5) and sets us up for growth. Then next turn, move DOWN to (9,5) to eat the apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, (8, 3) is not in my body list. Let's check: body has (9, 3) but not (8, 3). Actually, (8, 3) is empty on board (board shows '.' at (8, 3) in row 3? Let's check board: row 3: T T T . . T T . . T \u2192 positions: (0,3)=T, (1,3)=T, (2,3)=T, (3,3)=., (4,3)=., (5,3)=T, (6,3)=T, (7,3)=., (8,3)=., (9,3)=T. So (8, 3) is '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (7, 4): apple \u2192 safe (eat and grow).  \n- RIGHT (9, 4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy snake possible moves**  \nEnemy head: (8, 6)  \nBody: [(8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3)]  \n\nEnemy safe moves from (8, 6):  \n- UP (8, 7): own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (8, 5): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (7, 6): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (9, 6): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**  \nIf I go UP to (8, 5): enemy can go DOWN to (8, 5) same turn \u2192 collision \u2192 both die.  \nIf I go DOWN to (8, 3): enemy can't reach (8, 3) in 1 move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \nIf I go LEFT to (7, 4): enemy can't reach (7, 4) in 1 move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n\nSo UP is risky due to possible head-on collision.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nLEFT (7, 4) is an apple \u2192 immediate growth to 26 apples.  \nUP (8, 5) is empty but leads toward (9, 5) apple in 2 moves.  \nDOWN (8, 3) is empty, leads toward (6, 2) apple in 3 moves.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each move**  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 4) and eat apple:  \nNext turn head at (7, 4), body longer by 1 (old tail stays).  \nFrom (7, 4):  \n- UP (7, 5): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (7, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (6, 4): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (8, 4): my old head (now body) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves, good mobility.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 3):  \nFrom (8, 3):  \n- UP (8, 4): my old head (body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (8, 2): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (7, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (9, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nIf I go UP to (8, 5):  \nFrom (8, 5):  \n- UP (8, 6): enemy head now? Wait, enemy might move away from (8, 6) this turn, but if enemy goes DOWN to (8, 5) we collide this turn, so this scenario only if enemy doesn't go DOWN. Let's assume enemy avoids collision and goes LEFT or RIGHT. Then (8, 6) could be enemy body or empty? If enemy moves away, (8, 6) becomes body (old head) \u2192 unsafe for me next turn. So UP from (8, 5) to (8, 6) likely unsafe next turn.  \n- DOWN (8, 4): my old head (body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (7, 5): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (9, 5): apple but off board? Wait, (9, 5) is apple but board shows A at (9, 5) in row 5: row 5: T T T T T T . . . A \u2192 (9, 5) is A. So RIGHT (9, 5) is on board and apple. But (9, 5) is currently apple, but next turn? If I don't eat it now, maybe enemy eats? Anyway, from (8, 5), RIGHT (9, 5) is on board and currently apple. That could be safe if not occupied.  \nBut check: (9, 5) is currently apple, but if enemy moves RIGHT from (8, 6) to (9, 6), then (9, 5) is safe for me next turn? Possibly. But too uncertain.  \n\nGiven head-on risk this turn for UP, better to avoid UP.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy likely move**  \nEnemy has 3 safe moves: DOWN (8, 5), LEFT (7, 6), RIGHT (9, 6).  \nEnemy might avoid DOWN if it predicts I might go UP (8, 5) for collision. But enemy doesn't know my move.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (8, 5), it's safe unless I go UP.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (7, 6), safe.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (9, 6), safe.  \nEnemy might prefer DOWN to stay near center or toward apples? (9, 5) apple is near (9, 6) if enemy goes RIGHT then DOWN next turn.  \nBut (8, 6) apple is already eaten? Wait, board shows (8, 6) is '1' (enemy head), not apple. Apples are at (7, 4), (0, 6), (8, 0), (9, 5), (6, 2). So no apple at (8, 6). So enemy has no immediate apple in its 1-step moves.  \n\nSo enemy might choose randomly among safe moves.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Best choice for me**  \nLEFT gives immediate apple (26 apples), good future mobility, no head-on risk.  \nDOWN gives no apple now but keeps options open.  \nUP risks collision.  \n\nSo LEFT is best.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (7, 4), I\u2019ll have 26 apples, enemy likely 25. From (7, 4) I can go UP/DOWN/LEFT, all safe, possibly targeting (6, 2) or (9, 5) later while avoiding enemy.  \n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current state:\n\nYour head is at (9,6). Let's evaluate the four moves:\n\n- UP: (9,7) - Check: Your body segments: [(8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)]. (9,7) is not in this list. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (9,7). Board is 10x10, so (9,7) is within bounds (y=7). Safe.\n- DOWN: (9,5) - This is an apple! Check: Your body? No. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (9,5). Board is 10x10. Safe and leads to growth.\n- LEFT: (8,6) - This is your neck (the segment directly behind your head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (10,6) - Off the board (x=10 is invalid). Unsafe.\n\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe. DOWN leads to an apple at (9,5), which would bring us to 26 apples (tying enemy).\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0: head at (7,4). It can move UP to (7,5), DOWN to (7,3), LEFT to (6,4), RIGHT to (8,4). All these are safe? Check:\n- UP (7,5): Not in enemy body? Enemy body: [(8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9)] - no (7,5). Safe.\n- DOWN (7,3): Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT (6,4): Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT (8,4): This is the neck (segment behind head). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. The apple at (7,4) is adjacent to enemy head (LEFT move). Enemy will likely take LEFT to (7,4) to eat that apple, bringing it to 27 apples.\n\nIf we take DOWN to (9,5), we get to 26. Enemy gets to 27. Then we need to catch up.\n\nAfter eating (9,5), our head will be at (9,5) and we grow. Our body will extend by one segment (so tail doesn't move). Then we can consider next moves from (9,5): UP to (9,6) (but that is our current head position? Actually after growth, the segment behind head becomes the new head position? No: when we eat, we grow, so the head moves to the apple cell, and the body extends by keeping the tail in place. So our body becomes longer. From (9,5), we can move UP to (9,6) (which is currently our head, but after move it becomes body? Actually careful: current head is (9,6). Moving DOWN to (9,5) eats apple. Then new head is (9,5). The segment behind is (9,6) which is now body. So from (9,5), moves:\n- UP to (9,6): body segment (unsafe)\n- DOWN to (9,4): check? Not in our body? Our body will include (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), ... etc. (9,4) is not in current body. But enemy might be there? Possibly safe.\n- LEFT to (8,5): check? Not in body.\n- RIGHT: off board.\n\nSo after eating, we have DOWN and LEFT as safe moves.\n\nAlternatively, if we go UP to (9,7), we avoid the apple and remain at 25. But then enemy gets (7,4) and becomes 27. We fall further behind. So UP is worse.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is clearly better: we get the apple and grow.\n\nThere is no risk of head-on collision here: enemy is at (7,4) and we are at (9,6) moving to (9,5). They are far apart.\n\nPlan: Eat the apple at (9,5) to grow to 26. Then next turn, from (9,5), we can consider moving DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5) to target other apples (like (6,2) or (8,0)). Enemy will be at 27, so we need to be aggressive.\n\nDOWN",

Need 4 more apples.  \nApples left: (0, 6), (8, 0), (6, 2), (5, 8) after enemy eats (9, 5).  \nClosest to me: (6, 2) is 2 steps from (7, 4) via DOWN then LEFT, or LEFT then DOWN.  \nAlso (5, 8) is far, (0, 6) is far, (8, 0) is far.  \n\nBest to go toward (6, 2) while keeping space from enemy.  \nEnemy after eating (9, 5) will be at (9, 5) with longer body.  \n\nFrom (7, 4):  \n- DOWN (7, 3) then LEFT (6, 3) then DOWN (6, 2) eats apple in 3 turns.  \n- LEFT (6, 4) then DOWN (6, 3) then DOWN (6, 2) eats apple in 3 turns.  \n\nBoth similar, but DOWN first may be slightly safer because enemy is at (9, 5) and might move toward (8, 0) or (5, 8) next.  \n\nActually, if enemy goes DOWN to (9, 5), next turn enemy could go LEFT (8, 5) toward center, possibly toward (6, 2) as well.  \nSo I should move quickly toward (6, 2).  \n\nLEFT (6, 4) is closer to (6, 2) in Manhattan distance (2 steps) than DOWN (7, 3) (3 steps).  \nCheck:  \nFrom (6, 4) to (6, 2): DOWN twice (2 steps).  \nFrom (7, 3) to (6, 2): LEFT then DOWN (2 steps) but (6, 3) is safe.  \n\nActually both are 2 moves away.  \nBut LEFT now to (6, 4) might be better because:  \n- It puts me in column 6, closer to apple in same column.  \n- From (6, 4) I can go DOWN to (6, 3) next, then DOWN to (6, 2) to eat.  \n- Enemy at (9, 5) would need 3 moves to reach (6, 2): (9, 5) \u2192 (8, 5) \u2192 (7, 5) \u2192 (6, 5) then DOWN to (6, 2)? Wait, that\u2019s 4 moves. So I can beat enemy to (6, 2).  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \nAll moves safe, similar mobility. LEFT seems best for shortest path to (6, 2).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter LEFT to (6, 4), next turn go DOWN to (6, 3) (unless enemy blocks), then DOWN to (6, 2) to eat apple #27. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s possible path to (6, 2) \u2014 they might try to cut me off via (7, 5) etc.  \n\nLEFT",

(9,4) is not in this list. Enemy body: Snake #0's body includes (9,4)? Yes, enemy body has (9,4) as the third segment. So moving into enemy body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (8,5) - Check: Not in your body. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (8,5). Board is 10x10. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (10,5) - Off the board (x=10 is invalid). Unsafe.\n\nSo only LEFT is safe.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0: head at (6,4). It has apples:26. It can move:\n- UP: (6,5) - Check: Not in enemy body? Enemy body: [(7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8)].

Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. There is an apple at (6,2) which is two moves away (DOWN then DOWN). Enemy might go for it.\n\nSince only LEFT is safe for us, we must move to (8,5). From there, we can plan next moves. Note that (8,5) is adjacent to the apple at (8,0)? Not directly, but we can head downward.\n\nLong-term plan: We are at 26 apples, enemy at 26. We need to get to 30 first. After moving to (8,5), we can consider moving DOWN to (8,4) or LEFT to (7,5) next turn. The apple at (8,0) is reachable by going down. Also, (6,2) is another target. Avoid enemy head at (6,4) - it might move towards us.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, enemy moves this turn from (9, 5) to (8, 5), so tail (5, 3) will shift forward, leaving (5, 3) empty next turn? No \u2014 enemy length stays same unless eats apple, so after moving, last segment (5, 3) disappears, new head (8, 5), new tail at (5, 2)? Let's check: enemy body length 26, no apple eaten this turn, so after moving LEFT to (8, 5), tail (5, 3) disappears, (5, 3) becomes free next turn. So (5, 3) will be safe next turn.)  \n- RIGHT (7, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 4):**  \nFrom (5, 4):  \n- UP (5, 5): enemy body (5, 5) will still be there next turn?

T T T . . 0 T T \u2192 (4, 4) is 'T' (enemy body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (6, 4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only 1 safe move next turn (DOWN).  \n\n**So mobility ranking:** DOWN (3 safe moves) > UP (2 safe moves) > LEFT (1 safe move).\n\n**Path to nearest apple:**  \nClosest apple is (6, 2) \u2014 2 steps away via DOWN then DOWN.  \nIf I go DOWN now to (6, 3), next turn I can go DOWN to (6, 2) and eat apple #27.  \nEnemy at (8, 5) next turn is 3 steps from (6, 2) (8,5 \u2192 7,5 \u2192 6,5 \u2192 6,4 \u2192 6,3 \u2192 6,2? Actually that\u2019s 5 steps Manhattan). So I can get there first.\n\n**Risk:** Enemy might try to cut me off toward other apples later, but getting to 27 apples first is key.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nGo DOWN now to (6, 3), then DOWN next turn to (6, 2) to eat apple. After that, assess path to (5, 8) or (0, 6) while keeping mobility. Avoid being trapped by enemy\u2019s long body.\n\nDOWN",

(8,4) is not in this list. Enemy body: Snake #0's body includes (8,4)? Yes, enemy body has (8,4) as the third segment. So moving into enemy body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (7,5) - Check: Not in your body. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (7,5). Board is 10x10. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,5) - This is your own neck (the segment directly behind your head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n\nSo only LEFT is safe.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0: head at (6,3). It has apples:26. It can move:\n- UP: (6,4) - This is its own neck (segment behind head). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,2) - Check: Not in enemy body? Enemy body: [(6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)]. (6,2) is not present. Safe. Also, there is an apple at (6,2) - so enemy is likely to go DOWN to eat it.\n- LEFT: (5,3) - Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,3) - Not in enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo enemy has three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Given the apple at (6,2), DOWN is very attractive.\n\nSince only LEFT is safe for us, we must move to (7,5). From there, we can plan next moves. The apple at (5,8) is above and left, but we need to avoid the enemy. The enemy might be at (6,2) next turn if it goes DOWN. We should consider moving towards the apple at (5,8) or (2,9), but we need to be cautious of enemy movements.\n\nLong-term: Both snakes at 26 apples. We need to get to 30 first. After moving to (7,5), we can consider UP to (7,6) or LEFT to (6,5) next turn. The apple at (5,8) is reachable via UP and LEFT. Avoid enemy head which might be at (6,2) or moving towards us.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s analyze the current state after my last move (DOWN to (6,3)).\n\n**My head:** (6,3)  \n**My body:** length 27 (since I ate apple at (6,2) last turn? Wait \u2014 last turn rationale said I\u2019d go DOWN to (6,3) then next turn DOWN to (6,2) to eat apple. But the current board shows my head at (6,3) and apple still at (6,2), so I haven\u2019t eaten it yet. That means last turn I went DOWN to (6,3), and this turn I can eat (6,2) if I go DOWN again. Yes, because board shows apple at (6,2) still present, and my body length is 26 (apples collected: 26). So I didn\u2019t eat last turn. Good.)\n\n**Safe moves from (6,3):**  \n- UP (6,4): my body at (6,4) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (6,2): apple at (6,2) \u2192 safe (eat apple, grow to length 27).  \n- LEFT (5,3): currently enemy tail at (5,3)? Enemy tail is (5,2) now? Let\u2019s check enemy body: ends at (5,2) in current list. So (5,3) is empty (board shows '.' at (5,3) in row 3: T T T . . T . . . T \u2192 (5,3) is '.'). So safe.  \n- RIGHT (7,3): board row 3: T T T . . T . . . T \u2192 (7,3) is '.' \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo all three DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Enemy head:** (8,5)  \n**Enemy body length:** 26  \n**Enemy safe moves from (8,5):**  \n- UP (8,6): board row 6: A T T T . T . . T 1 \u2192 (8,6) is 'T' (enemy body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (8,4): board row 4: T . T T T . . 0 T T \u2192 (8,4) is 'T' (my body) \u2192 unsafe for enemy.  \n- LEFT (7,5): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (9,5): enemy body at (9,5) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is LEFT to (7,5).\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf enemy goes to (7,5) and I go DOWN to (6,2) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I go LEFT to (5,3) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (7,3) \u2192 enemy at (7,5) \u2192 not same cell, no collision.  \nSo no immediate head-on risk.\n\n**Apple positions:** (0,6), (8,0), (6,2), (5,8), (2,9)  \nFrom my head (6,3):  \n- DOWN (6,2) \u2192 apple.  \n- LEFT (5,3) \u2192 no apple.  \n- RIGHT (7,3) \u2192 no apple.\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**\n\n1. **DOWN to (6,2)** \u2014 eat apple, grow to length 27.  \nFrom (6,2) next turn:  \n- UP (6,3): my body (current head) will be at (6,3) after move? Wait, after I move DOWN to (6,2), my body shifts: head to (6,2), old head (6,3) becomes second segment, tail stays same length +1. So (6,3) will be my body \u2192 unsafe next turn.  \n- DOWN (6,1): board row 1: T T . . . T T T T T \u2192 (6,1) is 'T' (my body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (5,2): board row 2: T T T T T T A . . T \u2192 (5,2) is 'T' (enemy body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (7,2): board row 2: T T T T T T A . . T \u2192 (7,2) is '.' \u2192 safe.  \nSo only 1 safe move next turn (RIGHT). That\u2019s risky \u2014 could trap me.\n\n2. **LEFT to (5,3)**  \nFrom (5,3) next turn:  \n- UP (5,4): board row 4: T . T T T . . 0 T T \u2192 (5,4) is '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (5,2): enemy body (5,2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (4,3): board row 3: T T T . . T . . . T \u2192 (4,3) is '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (6,3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT).\n\n3. **RIGHT to (7,3)**  \nFrom (7,3) next turn:  \n- UP (7,4): my body (7,4) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (7,2): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (6,3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (8,3): board row 3: T T T . . T . . . T \u2192 (8,3) is '.' \u2192 safe.  \nSo 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT).\n\n**But** \u2014 if I eat apple at (6,2), I reach 27 apples, enemy has 26. Getting closer to 30. But being trapped with only 1 safe move next turn is dangerous. However, enemy\u2019s only move is to (7,5), so they can\u2019t block my only safe move (RIGHT to (7,2)) next turn unless they move again after that \u2014 but they\u2019ll be at (7,5) next turn, I\u2019ll be at (6,2), my only safe move is RIGHT to (7,2), which is adjacent to enemy at (7,5)? No, (7,2) is 3 steps away from (7,5) vertically. So not immediately blocked. But after that, I\u2019d be at (7,2) with limited options maybe.\n\n**Alternative:** skip apple now, go LEFT or RIGHT to keep mobility, then maybe get apple later. But enemy could eat (6,2) if I skip? Enemy at (7,5) next turn, then could go DOWN to (7,4) (my body) \u2192 unsafe, or LEFT to (6,5) then DOWN to (6,4) then DOWN to (6,3) then DOWN to (6,2) \u2014 that\u2019s 4 turns, so I could still get it later if I stay close.\n\nBut winning requires reaching 30 apples first. I\u2019m at 26, enemy at 26. Eating this apple puts me ahead 27\u201326. That\u2019s good.\n\n**Risk of dying:** If I eat apple and go to (6,2), next turn only RIGHT is safe. From (7,2) after that, I\u2019d need to check options then \u2014 might be okay if I plan.\n\nLet\u2019s check path after (6,2) \u2192 (7,2):  \nFrom (7,2):  \n- UP (7,3): likely free (currently '.' and will be unless enemy moves there).  \n- DOWN (7,1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (6,2): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (8,2): '.' \u2192 safe.  \nSo possibly 2 safe moves then. So not a dead end immediately.\n\nGiven I need apples and I\u2019m safe to eat now, I\u2019ll take it.\n\n**Plan:**  \nDOWN this turn to (6,2) eat apple \u2192 27 apples. Next turn likely RIGHT to (7,2), then assess path to (5,8) or (0,6) while keeping distance from enemy.\n\nDOWN",

(row 6 col 7 is '.' from board) \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (7, 4): my body at (7, 4) \u2192 unsafe for enemy.  \n- LEFT (6, 5): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (8, 5): enemy body at (8, 5) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP or LEFT.  \n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (6, 5) and I go RIGHT to (7, 2) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf enemy goes UP to (7, 6) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nSo safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Next turn planning:**  \nFrom (7, 2) next turn:  \n- UP (7, 3): currently '.' and likely free unless enemy moves there.  \n- DOWN (7, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (6, 2): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (8, 2): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo likely 2 safe moves next turn (UP, RIGHT).  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI need 3 more apples to win (30 total). Apples at (3, 1) and (8, 0) are closest after (7, 2).  \nFrom (7, 2), go UP to (7, 3) next turn, then possibly LEFT toward (3, 1) or RIGHT toward (8, 0) depending on enemy position. Avoid getting trapped near enemy\u2019s long body.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "Looking at the current state:\n\nYour head is at (7,5). Let's evaluate the four moves:\n\n- UP: (7,6) - Check your body: [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]. (7,6) is not present. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (7,6). Safe.\n- DOWN: (7,4) - Check: Your body has no (7,4). Enemy body: Snake #0's body includes (7,4)? Yes, enemy body has (7,4) as the third segment. Moving into enemy body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (6,5) - Check: Not in your body. Enemy body: Snake #0's body has no (6,5). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,5) - This is your own neck (the segment directly behind your head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves are UP and LEFT.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0: head at (6,2). It has 27 apples. It can move:\n- UP: (6,3) - This is its own neck (segment behind head). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,1) - Check: Enemy body has (6,1) as the 10th segment? Yes, so unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,2) - Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,2) - Not in enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo enemy has two safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. There is an apple at (8,0) and (3,1), but both are distant. Enemy might move LEFT towards (5,2) or RIGHT towards (7,2). Given its body extends to (1,8) and (0,5), it might prefer LEFT to avoid trapping itself.\n\nFor us, we have two safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nApples: (0,6), (8,0), (5,8), (2,9), (3,1). The closest is (5,8) at distance |7-5|+|5-8|=2+3=5, and (2,9) at |7-2|+|5-9|=5+4=9. UP moves us closer to (5,8): from (7,5) to (7,6) reduces distance to (5,8) to |7-5|+|6-8|=2+2=4. LEFT moves to (6,5), which is same distance to (5,8): |6-5|+|5-8|=1+3=4.\n\nAlso, UP to (7,6) gives future moves: UP to (7,7) (but your body has (7,7)? Yes, so unsafe next turn), LEFT to (6,6), RIGHT to (8,6) (your body has (8,6)? Yes), DOWN to (7,5) (your head was just there, but body will move). So UP might lead to limited options next turn.\n\nLEFT to (6,5) gives future moves: UP to (6,6) (safe), DOWN to (6,4) (enemy body has (6,4)? Yes, unsafe), LEFT to (5,5) (your body has (5,5)? Yes, unsafe), RIGHT to (7,5) (safe). So LEFT gives two safe moves next turn: UP and RIGHT.\n\nMoreover, enemy head is at (6,2). Moving LEFT to (6,5) keeps us away from enemy. Moving UP to (7,6) is also safe from enemy.\n\nGiven we need to reach 30 apples (we have 26, enemy has 27), we should prioritize collecting apples quickly. The apple at (5,8) is reachable via UP moves. However, LEFT is also good and keeps more options open next turn.\n\nLong-term plan: We need to collect 4 more apples to win. The apples at (5,8) and (2,9) are good targets. Avoid enemy head which is at (6,2) and might move LEFT to (5,2) or RIGHT to (7,2). We should move towards (5,8) via UP and LEFT sequences. This turn, UP is directly towards it.\n\nBut UP to (7,6) has only one safe follow-up? Actually, next turn after UP, our body will shift: head at (7,6), body becomes [ (7,5), (8,5), ... ]. Then moves from (7,6):\n- UP: (7,7) - your body will have (7,7) (current segment) so unsafe.\n- DOWN: (7,5) - safe (was head, but now empty).\n- LEFT: (6,6) - safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,6) - your body has (8,6) so unsafe.\nSo two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. So not too bad.\n\nLEFT to (6,5) gives two safe moves next turn: UP and RIGHT.\n\nBoth are viable. But UP is more directly towards the apple at (5,8). We should take UP.\n\nAlso, enemy might move RIGHT to (7,2), which is close to (6,5) if we go LEFT? Distance |6-7|+|5-2|=1+3=4, so not immediate threat.\n\nChoose UP to get closer to apple.\n\nUP",

Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (7,5) - This is your neck (the segment directly behind your head). Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (6,6) - Check your body: not present. Enemy body: Snake #0 has no (6,6). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,6) - Check your body: [(8,6) is your 5th segment]. Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n\nSo only safe move is LEFT to (6,6).\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0: head at (7,2). It can move:\n- UP: (7,3) - Check enemy body: not present. Safe.\n- DOWN: (7,1) - Enemy body has (7,1) as 10th segment? Yes, unsafe.\n- LEFT: (6,2) - Enemy neck (segment behind head). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (8,2) - Not in enemy body.

(row 6 col 6 is '.' from board) \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (8, 6): enemy body at (8, 6) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is LEFT to (6, 6).  \n\n---\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf I go UP to (7, 3) and enemy goes LEFT to (6, 6) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 2) and enemy goes LEFT to (6, 6) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nSo both my safe moves avoid head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Future planning:**  \nFrom (7, 3) next turn:  \n- UP (7, 4): my body at (7, 4) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (7, 2): my body at (7, 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (6, 3): my body at (6, 3) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (8, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo from (7, 3), only RIGHT is safe next turn \u2014 that\u2019s a dead end after 1 move.  \n\nFrom (8, 2) next turn:  \n- UP (8, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (8, 1): my body at (8, 1) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (7, 2): my body at (7, 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (9, 2): my body at (9, 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo from (8, 2), only UP is safe next turn \u2014 also a dead end after 1 move.  \n\nBoth options lead to only 1 safe move next turn, but from (8, 2) \u2192 (8, 3) next turn, I can then possibly go LEFT to (7, 3) or RIGHT to (9, 3) depending on enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple to (7, 2) is (8, 0) (2 steps away) or (3, 1) (5 steps away).  \nFrom (8, 2), (8, 0) is straight down but blocked by my body at (8, 1).  \nFrom (7, 3), (3, 1) is closer in Manhattan distance but path may be blocked by my body.  \n\nActually, looking at my body:  \nMy tail is at (1, 7), so the lower left area is full of my body. Apple (3, 1) is surrounded by my body at (3, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), etc. I can\u2019t reach (3, 1) without my body moving out of the way first.  \n\nApple (8, 0) is near my body at (8, 1) and (9, 1), but if I go to (8, 2) then (8, 3) then (9, 3) then (9, 2) then (9, 1) then (8, 1) then (8, 0) \u2014 that\u2019s long and risky.  \n\nApple (5, 8) is far but reachable via top-right area.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s only move is LEFT to (6, 6), they will be closer to apple (0, 6) and (5, 8) soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Best choice:**  \nUP to (7, 3) feels slightly better because it keeps me closer to center and maybe toward (5, 8) later via (7, 4) once my body moves. But (7, 4) is my body now, so need to wait.  \nRIGHT to (8, 2) puts me near edge.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose UP to stay more central and avoid edge traps.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 3), only RIGHT is safe next turn, so I must go RIGHT to (8, 3) next turn. Then from (8, 3) I\u2019ll have more options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT likely).  \n\nUP",

Evaluate the four moves:\n\n- UP: (6,7) - Check your body: [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), ...] -> (6,7) is your 9th segment. Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,5) - Check your body: [(7,6), (7,5), ...] -> (6,5) is not in your body? Actually, your body has (7,5) and (5,5), but (6,5) is free. However, check enemy: Snake #0 has no (6,5). So safe.\n- LEFT: (5,6) - Check your body: [(5,7), (5,6), ...] -> (5,6) is your 10th segment. Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,6) - Check your body: [(7,6) is your neck (the segment directly behind your head)]. Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n\nSo only safe move is DOWN to (6,5).\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0: head at (7,3). It can move:\n- UP: (7,4) - Enemy body has (7,4) as 4th segment? Yes, unsafe.\n- DOWN: (7,2) - Enemy neck (segment behind head). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (6,3) - Enemy body has (6,3) as 2nd segment? Yes, unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (8,3) - Check enemy body: not present. Safe.\n\nSo enemy has only one safe move: RIGHT to (8,3).\n\nApples at: (0,6), (8,0), (5,8), (2,9), (3,1). From (6,5), the closest is (5,8) at |6-5|+|5-8|=1+3=4, or (3,1) at |6-3|+|5-1|=3+4=7. Moving DOWN to (6,5) doesn't directly help, but it avoids death.\n\nFrom (6,5), future moves:\n- UP: (6,6) - Your head was just there, but body will move. Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,4) - Check your body: [(4,4), ...] but (6,4) not present. Enemy body: Snake #0 has (6,4) as 3rd segment? Yes, so unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,5) - Your body has (5,5) as 11th segment? Yes, unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,5) - Your body has (7,5) as 1st segment? Actually, after moving, your body will shift: head to (6,5), then (7,6) becomes new neck? So (7,5) is not in your body? But wait, your current body has (7,5) as the second segment. After moving down, the head moves to (6,5), and the tail shortens? Actually, no: since no apple eaten, length remains same. So the new body will be: head (6,5), then (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), ... so (7,5) is the third segment. So moving RIGHT to (7,5) would hit your own body. Unsafe.\n\nSo next turn from (6,5), only safe move would be UP back to (6,6). That is not ideal, but we must survive this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: We need 4 apples to win (30 total), enemy has 27 so we are behind. We must collect apples quickly. The apple at (5,8) is our best target. However, we are currently trapped. After moving DOWN to (6,5), we can only go back to (6,6) next turn. Then we might have more options? Also, enemy is moving RIGHT to (8,3), which is away from us.\n\nSince only DOWN is safe, we must choose it.\n\nDOWN",

But my body will move:  \nMy tail is at (1, 6). After this turn, my head goes to (8, 3), body shifts: (7, 3) becomes new neck, tail moves to (0, 5)? Let\u2019s trace:  \nCurrent body length = 28 segments (head + 27 body parts). Eating an apple would make 29, but not eating now. So length stays 28.  \nNew head at (8, 3), old head (7, 3) becomes first body segment, last body segment (1, 6) is removed.  \n\nSo next turn body occupies: (8, 3) head, (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5).  \n\nSo (8, 2) is free next turn.  \n\nBut from (8, 3) next turn, DOWN to (8, 2) is safe, but then from (8, 2) the turn after, all adjacent cells are body:  \n- (8, 3) body  \n- (8, 1) body  \n- (7, 2) body  \n- (9, 2) body  \n\nSo indeed, going RIGHT now leads to death in 2 turns unless I eat an apple before reaching (8, 2).  \n\n---\n\n**Apple reachability:**  \nApple (8, 0) is below (8, 2), but to get it I\u2019d need to go (8, 3) \u2192 (8, 2) \u2192 (8, 1) \u2192 (8, 0).  \n(8, 1) is body now and will still be body when I\u2019m at (8, 2) \u2014 so can\u2019t reach (8, 0) before dying.  \n\nApple (5, 8) is far, unreachable in 2 moves.  \n\nSo I must eat an apple on the turn I move to (8, 3) or next turn at (8, 2) to survive.  \n\n---\n\n**Check apple at (8, 3)?** No.  \nApple at (8, 2)? No.  \n\nSo no apple in those cells.  \n\nThis means RIGHT is fatal in 2 turns with no escape unless enemy dies or board changes.  \n\n---\n\n**But wait \u2014 I have only one safe move now: RIGHT.** So I must take it and hope enemy dies or I can force an apple eat somehow?  \n\nActually, let\u2019s recheck safe moves from (7, 3):  \nUP (7, 4) \u2014 body \u2014 yes unsafe.  \nDOWN (7, 2) \u2014 body \u2014 unsafe.  \nLEFT (6, 3) \u2014 body \u2014 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (8, 3) \u2014 free.  \n\nSo indeed only RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** I have no choice. Must go RIGHT and then try to eat apple (5, 8) or (2, 9) later by maneuvering, but that seems impossible from (8, 2) dead end.  \n\nMaybe enemy will die before me? Enemy\u2019s only move is DOWN to (6, 5), then from (6, 5) they have more options.  \n\nI\u2019ll go RIGHT and hope for the best.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 3) only DOWN is safe. Take DOWN to (8, 2). Then from (8, 2) all adjacent are body \u2014 so unless an apple spawns there or enemy dies freeing a cell, I\u2019ll die. Need to check if any apple appears at (8, 2) or (8, 3) by next turn \u2014 unlikely.  \n\nThis looks grim, but no alternative now.  \n\nRIGHT",

Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,4) - Check your body: [(4,4), ...] but (6,4) is not in your body. Check enemy: Snake #0 has (6,4) as the 3rd segment? Yes, so moving into enemy body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,5) - Check your body: [(5,5) is the 11th segment]. Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,5) - Check your body: [(7,5) is the 2nd segment]. Moving backwards is fatal. Unsafe.\n\nAll four moves are fatal? That can't be right. Let me double-check:\n\nAfter your last move DOWN, your head moved from (6,6) to (6,5). Now your body has shifted: the new head is at (6,5), and the tail has shortened (since no apple was eaten). The new body should be: head (6,5), then the old body without the tail? Actually, the tail segment (1,2) is dropped because no growth.\n\nSo the new body is: [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2)] but without the last segment? Actually, the tail moves forward: the head moves to (6,5), and each body segment moves to the position of the previous one. So the new body is:\n- Segment 1: (6,6) [old head position]\n- Segment 2: (7,6) [old segment 1]\n- Segment 3: (7,5) [old segment 2]\n- ... and so on, up to segment 26: (1,3) [old segment 25], and the tail (old segment 26) is dropped.\n\nSo the new body list is: [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3)]\n\nNow check moves:\n- UP: (6,6) is segment 1 (neck). Moving backwards: fatal.\n- DOWN: (6,4) is not in your body. But check enemy: Snake #0 has (6,4) in its body (3rd segment). So fatal.\n- LEFT: (5,5) is segment 12. Moving into your own body: fatal.\n- RIGHT: (7,5) is segment 3. Moving into your own body: fatal.\n\nIndeed, all moves are fatal. This means you are trapped and have no safe move. This is a terminal state.\n\nHowever, we must consider if there is any escape. Perhaps the enemy snake might die, freeing up a cell? But enemy moves simultaneously.\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (8,3). It can move:\n- UP: (8,4) - Enemy body has (8,4) as 5th segment? Yes, fatal.\n- DOWN: (8,2) - Not in enemy body? Enemy body: [(7,3), (7,2), (6,2), ...] so (8,2) is free. Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,3) - Enemy neck (segment behind head). Fatal.\n- RIGHT: (9,3) - Enemy body has (9,3) as 7th segment? Yes, fatal.\n\nSo enemy has only one safe move: DOWN to (8,2).\n\nNow, if enemy moves DOWN to (8,2), it will not free any cell for you. You are still trapped.\n\nTherefore, there is no safe move for you. You must choose a move that minimizes the chance of head-on collision or other negative outcomes, but all moves kill you.\n\nSince all moves are equally fatal, we choose arbitrarily. Perhaps DOWN to (6,4) might not be head-on collision with enemy? But enemy is moving to (8,2), so no collision.\n\nBut you will die regardless.\n\nGiven the rules, if you have no safe move, you must still choose one. We choose DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan: None, as this is likely the end.\n\nDOWN",
