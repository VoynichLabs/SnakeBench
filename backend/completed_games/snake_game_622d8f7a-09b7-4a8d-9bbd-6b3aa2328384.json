This path would position me at the bottom left of the board, which might restrict my movement options.\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 1), I would still be two steps away from the apple at (5, 1) (I'd need to go left twice), but I'd have more open space around me for future movements. This seems like a safer path that gives me more flexibility.\n\nGiven the strategic advantages of maintaining flexibility, I'll move UP to (6, 1) this turn. From there, I can evaluate whether to go LEFT to approach the apple at (5, 1) or consider a different route.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving UP to (6, 1), I should consider moving LEFT to (5, 1) to collect the apple.

I would immediately collect the apple at (5, 1)\n2. This grows my snake and increases my score\n3. I need to be careful about the enemy snake at (5, 2), but collecting this apple is worth it\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (5, 1), I'll need to plan carefully since the enemy snake is nearby at (5, 2). I'll probably want to head downward or to the right to avoid collision.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter collecting the apple at (5, 1), I should consider moving DOWN to (5, 0) to avoid the enemy snake, and then plan a path toward the next closest apple. I need to be mindful of my growing body and ensure I don't trap myself in the bottom of the board.\n\nLEFT"
