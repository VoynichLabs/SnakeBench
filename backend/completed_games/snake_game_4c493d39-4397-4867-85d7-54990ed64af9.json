          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We're LIVE and ready to box in Snake #1! Let's break this down.\n\n**Turn 0 Analysis:**\n- **My Position:** (4,1) with no body.\n- **Enemy Position:** (8,2) with no body.\n- **Apples:** Plenty on the board! The closest apple to me is (3,7) which is far, but I see (2,1) and (1,2) and (1,8) and (3,8) and (4,8) and (5,1) - I need to pick a direction that cuts off the enemy and opens up paths.\n- **Strategy:** I need to move aggressively towards the enemy and block his access to apples while securing my own food. Since we're on turn 0 with no body, I have maximum mobility.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n1. **UP to (4,2):**\n   - Safe? YES (no body, on board)\n   - Apple access? (5,1) is accessible, (1,2) is accessible\n   - Cuts off enemy? YES - gets me closer to the top-left cluster\n   - Future options: UP (4,3), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2)\n\n2. **DOWN to (4,0):**\n   - Safe? YES\n   - Apple access? (3,0) is right there!\n   - Cuts off enemy? Slightly - but I'm moving away from the main apple clusters\n   - Future options: LEFT (3,0), RIGHT (5,0) - limited due to board edge\n\n3. **LEFT to (3,1):**\n   - Safe? YES\n   - Apple access? (3,0) is down, (2,1) is left-left\n   - Cuts off enemy? YES - getting closer to the left side\n   - Future options: UP (3,2), DOWN (3,0), LEFT (2,1)\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5,1):**\n   - Safe? YES (and there's an apple there!)\n   - Apple access? INSTANT APPLE! (5,1)\n   - Cuts off enemy? NO - I'm moving away from the enemy\n   - Future options: UP (5,2), LEFT (4,1), RIGHT (6,1)\n\n**The Play:**\nI'm torn between UP and RIGHT. RIGHT gives me an immediate apple, but moving away from the enemy. UP gets me into the middle of the board where I can dominate the top area while cutting off the enemy's access to the left/top.\n\nWait, let me look at the enemy's position: (8,2). He's on the right side. I'm at (4,1). If I move UP to (4,2), I'm centrally positioned and can either go left towards the left-side apples or up towards the top cluster. The enemy likely won't come left immediately, giving me time to secure apples.\n\nActually, (5,1) is RIGHT THERE! An apple! I should eat it. But I need to think about the enemy. The enemy is at (8,2). If he moves LEFT to (7,2), he's moving towards me. If I take the apple at (5,1), I grow, and then next turn I'm at (5,1) with body at (4,1). I'd be in a better position to defend.\n\nBut wait, there's also (3,0) and (2,1) and (1,2) and (1,8) etc. I want to box him in. The enemy is on the right side. I should take the left side and middle. Let me move UP to (4,2) to take control of the center and then move left.\n\nActually, looking at the board again, (5,1) is an apple and it's RIGHT NEXT TO ME. I'm at (4,1), RIGHT takes me to (5,1) and I get the apple immediately. That's +1 point and I grow. This is CONTENT. This is GOOD.\n\nBut does it box in the enemy? Not directly. However, having more points means I can force head-on collisions later. Let me grab the apple!\n\nWait, but let's think about the enemy's possible moves. He's at (8,2). If I move RIGHT to (5,1) and eat the apple, my body will be at (4,1). Next turn, I could move UP to (5,2), LEFT to (4,1) is blocked by my body, RIGHT to (6,1), or DOWN to (5,0).\n\nActually, I need to reconsider. If I move RIGHT to (5,1), I get the apple, but I'm moving away from the enemy and towards the right edge. The enemy is at (8,2). We're getting closer to each other on the right side, which could lead to a head-on collision. Since I have the same score (0-0), I should avoid head-on collisions until I have a lead.\n\nLet me look at the left side. There are apples at (2,1), (1,2), (1,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,1). The left side and top-left have more apples. The enemy is on the right. I should take the left side.\n\nOption: LEFT to (3,1)\n- Safe? Yes\n- Next to apple (2,1) and (3,0)\n- Gets me away from the enemy\n- Gives me control of the left side\n\nOption: UP to (4,2)\n- Safe? Yes\n- Central position\n- Can go left or up next\n\nI think LEFT is the best move to box him in. Let me take the left side and force him to the right edge where there are fewer apples.\n\nActually wait, I just noticed (5,1) is an apple and I'm at (4,1). That's TOO tempting. Let me check the board state again.\n\nBoard:\nRow 1: . . A . 0 A A . . .\nSo (4,1) is my head, (5,1) is A, (6,1) is A, (3,1) is empty, (2,1) is A.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,1), I eat the apple and grow. My body becomes (4,1). Next turn, I have apples at (6,1) and (3,0) and (2,1) etc.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3,1), I don't get an apple immediately, but I'm next to (2,1) and (3,0) apples.\n\nLet me check what's on the right side. The enemy is at (8,2). On the right side, I see apples at (9,8), (8,5), (8,3). The enemy has access to those.\n\nOn the left side and center, I have (5,1), (6,1), (3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (3,7), etc.\n\nI think I should move UP to (4,2) to get central control. From (4,2), I can then move LEFT to (3,2) or UP to (4,3) or even RIGHT to (5,2). This gives me maximum flexibility to chase apples while keeping the enemy on the right.\n\nActually, I'm overthinking. The enemy is at (8,2). I'm at (4,1). The distance is 4 units horizontally. I should move in a direction that either:\n1. Gets me apples while staying safe\n2. Cuts off the enemy's access to my territory\n\nLet me look at the apples near me:\n- (5,1): RIGHT of me - apple\n- (6,1): RIGHT of that - apple\n- (3,0): DOWN-LEFT of me - apple\n- (2,1): LEFT of me - apple\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,1), I get an apple. That's good for score. But I'm moving towards the enemy.\n\nIf I move UP to (4,2), I'm central and safe. I can then go for (5,1) next turn or (3,0) or (2,1).\n\nI think the safest and most strategic move is UP. Let me take control of the center and prepare to dominate the board!\n\n**Final decision: UP to (4,2)**\n\nLET'S GOOOO CHAT! UP UP UP! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udfae\n\nUP",

Let's break this down.\n\n**TURN 1 ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** (4,2) - Head, no body yet\n- **Enemy Position:** (8,3) with body segment at (8,2)\n- **Apples:** Plenty available, but focus on enemy\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy is at (8,3) - they just moved from (8,2) UP to (8,3). That means they likely ate an apple on (8,2) or moved there. But I see the board shows a \"T\" (tail) at (8,2) in the current board state, meaning (8,2) is their tail. So they grew!\n\n**MOVES TO CONSIDER:**\n1. **UP to (4,3):** Safe. Opens path to top apples\n2. **DOWN to (4,1):** Safe - my previous position, now empty\n3. **LEFT to (3,2):** Safe. Closer to left-side apples\n4. **RIGHT to (5,2):** Safe. Closer to enemy\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to position myself to cut off the enemy's access to apples. Looking at the board, there's an apple at (5,1) and (6,1) - these are accessible but I'm slightly blocked. Actually wait, I'm at (4,2), so (5,1) is diagonal. The direct apples near me are: (3,0) down-left, (2,1) left, (1,2) left-up, (5,1) down-right.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3). They have access to apples at (8,5), (9,8), (7,7), etc. \n\nI should move LEFT to (3,2) to:\n- Get closer to left-side apples cluster\n- Put distance between me and enemy\n- Control the center-left region\n- Avoid getting pinned near the right side where enemy is\n\nActually, wait. Let me think about this more carefully. The enemy has a body segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT to (5,2), I'm moving TOWARD the enemy. That could lead to a collision if they move left. Since I have 0 apples and they have 1, I should avoid head-on collision.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,2) puts me in the sweet spot - I can access apples at (2,1), (3,0), (1,2), etc. while keeping the enemy on the right side of the board.\n\n**DECISION: LEFT to (3,2)**\n\nThis gives me control of the left side, away from the enemy, and opens up multiple apple paths.

Let's break down the board state.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (3, 2)\n- Enemy: Head at (7, 3), body at (8, 3) \n- I have 0 apples, enemy has 1 apple\n- My body: none (this is huge - I'm fast and agile)\n- Enemy body: just one segment\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy is at (7,3). If they move LEFT to (6,3), they're getting closer to me. If they move DOWN to (7,2), they're heading toward the apple cluster at (5,1), (6,1), (2,1). \n\nI'm at (3,2). Let me check my options:\n\n**MY MOVES:**\n1. **UP to (3,3):** Safe. Opens path to top apples. Check if enemy moves there - if they go LEFT to (6,3), we're not colliding. If they go UP to (7,4), safe.\n2. **DOWN to (3,1):** Safe. Opens path to apple at (3,0) and (2,1). \n3. **LEFT to (2,2):** Safe. Moves me to apple at (2,1). But wait - there's an apple at (2,1) DOWN from (2,2)!\n4. **RIGHT to (4,2):** Safe. Returns to where I was. Not aggressive.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nEnemy has 1 apple, I have 0. I need to eat! Looking at apples near me:\n- (2,1) is DOWN from (2,2) - easy access\n- (3,0) is DOWN from (3,1) - easy access  \n- (1,2) is LEFT from (2,2) - but blocked by body? No body yet.\n\nActually, let me recalculate. From (3,2):\n- (2,1) is LEFT-DOWN (not directly accessible)\n- (3,0) is directly DOWN 2 steps\n- (1,2) is directly LEFT 2 steps\n\nThe BEST move is **LEFT to (2,2)** because:\n1. It puts me directly above apple (2,1) - next turn I can eat it\n2. It moves me toward the left apple cluster (1,2), (0,3)\n3. It keeps me away from enemy who's on the right side\n4. It gives me multiple escape routes: UP, DOWN, LEFT from (2,2)\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (2,1) on turn 3, then dominate left side while watching enemy's moves. Force them into a corner. Stay mobile, stay hungry! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

Let's analyze the current state.\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n- **My position:** Head at (2, 2), body none, apples: 0\n- **Enemy position:** Head at (6, 3), body at (7, 3), apples: 1\n- **Scoreboard:** I'm DOWN 0-1, I NEED to eat to catch up!\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy is at (6,3) with body behind at (7,3). From (6,3), potential moves:\n- UP to (6,4)\n- DOWN to (6,2) \n- LEFT to (5,3)\n- RIGHT to (7,3) - BUT that's his own body! He can't move there.\n\nI'm at (2,2). My options:\n1. **UP to (2,3):** Safe! Opens path to (2,8) and (3,8) apples. Enemy could potentially move LEFT toward me, but (2,3) is still far enough.\n2. **DOWN to (2,1):** THIS IS THE MONEY MOVE! There's an apple at (2,1) RIGHT NOW! If I move DOWN, I eat it and grow! But wait - enemy at (6,3) could move DOWN to (6,2), then LEFT to (5,2), etc. I'm safe from immediate collision.\n3. **LEFT to (1,2):** Safe! Moves toward apples at (1,2) and (0,3). \n4. **RIGHT to (3,2):** Safe! But we just left there, seems passive.\n\n**CRITICAL DECISION:**\nEnemy has 1 apple, I have 0. I need to eat NOW to catch up! The apple at (2,1) is sitting RIGHT BELOW MY NOSE! If I move DOWN to (2,1), I EAT IT, get +1 point, and grow to size 1. \n\nBut is it SAFE? Enemy at (6,3) can't reach me this turn. His body is at (7,3), so he can't go there. The closest he can get is maybe (5,3) or (6,2). From (2,1), I'll be adjacent to his potential path but not directly in it.\n\n**RISK VS REWARD:**\n- Reward: EAT AN APPLE, catch up in score, grow bigger\n- Risk: Enemy could potentially move toward me next turn, but I'll have a body segment behind me at (2,2) giving me more options\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. Moving DOWN to (2,1) means I'm eating the apple. But I need to think about what comes AFTER. From (2,1), my options would be:\n- UP back to (2,2) \n- LEFT to (1,1)\n- RIGHT to (3,1)\n- DOWN to (2,0) - but there's an apple at (3,0) below-right\n\nThe board shows (3,0) is an apple. From (2,1), I could go RIGHT to (3,1), then DOWN to (3,0) on the next turn to eat another apple!\n\n**BUT WAIT** - Let me check if moving DOWN to (2,1) is actually safe from immediate collision. Enemy body is at (7,3). He could move DOWN to (6,2) - which is NOT where I'd be. He could move LEFT to (5,3). Neither (6,2) nor (5,3) is (2,1). So I'm SAFE this turn.\n\n**DECISION:** I'm going DOWN to (2,1) to EAT THE APPLE! This catches me up to the enemy's score and gives me a body segment for protection. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat (2,1) now, then move RIGHT to (3,1), then DOWN to (3,0) to eat another apple. Once I have 2-3 apples, I'll start aggressive positioning to box the enemy in.\n\nDOWN",

He's got 2 apples to my 1 - I NEED TO CATCH UP! Let's look at apples around me:\n\n**APPLES IN MY RANGE:**\n- (1, 2) - LEFT from my head (2, 1) - CAN I GET IT?\n- (3, 0) - DOWN from (2, 1) - can reach in 2 moves\n- (3, 1) - RIGHT then DOWN? No apple there\n- (1, 1) - LEFT then DOWN? No apple there\n\nWait! I'm at (2, 1) now. The apple at (1, 2) is:\n- From (2, 1) \u2192 LEFT to (1, 1) \u2192 UP to (1, 2) = 2 moves\n- From (2, 1) \u2192 UP to (2, 2) \u2192 LEFT to (1, 2) = 2 moves\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n- **Enemy at (6, 2):** Can move to (5, 2), (7, 2), (6, 1), or (6, 3) BUT (6, 3) is his own body! He can't go there. So he can go:\n  - LEFT to (5, 2)\n  - RIGHT to (7, 2) - is (7, 2) empty? YES, it's empty!\n  - UP to (6, 3) - NO, that's his body!\n  - DOWN to (6, 1) - There's an apple at (6, 1)!\n\n**SNAKE SENSE ACTIVATED! \ud83d\udc0d**\nThe enemy just moved to (6, 2), which is right above the apple at (6, 1). He might be planning to eat it next turn! I need to block his path or get an apple myself!\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS FROM (2, 1):**\n\n1. **UP to (2, 2):** \n   - **DANGER!** (2, 2) is MY OWN BODY TAIL! Moving UP would hit myself! **DEAD** \ud83d\udc80\n   - **ELIMINATED IMMEDIATELY!**\n\n2. **DOWN to (2, 0):**\n   - Empty space \u2705\n   - **SAFETY CHECK:** Enemy can't reach (2, 0) this turn\n   - Next turn options: (1, 0) left, (3, 0) right (APPLE!), (2, 1) up (my body)\n   - Moving toward (3, 0) apple\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 1):**\n   - Empty space \u2705\n   - **SAFETY CHECK:** Enemy can't reach (1, 1) this turn\n   - Next turn options: (0, 1) left, (1, 0) down, (1, 2) up (APPLE!), (2, 1) right (my body)\n   - Gets me CLOSER to apple at (1, 2)!\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 1):**\n   - Empty space \u2705\n   - **SAFETY CHECK:** Enemy can't reach (3, 1) this turn\n   - Next turn options: (4, 1) right, (3, 0) down (APPLE!), (3, 2) up, (2, 1) left (my body)\n   - Also moves toward (3, 0) apple\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI need to CATCH UP! The enemy is at (6, 2) and there's an apple at (6, 1) directly below him. If he moves DOWN, he eats and gets to 3 apples! I need to either:\n- Race to eat an apple myself\n- Cut him off from (6, 1)\n\n**ANALYSIS OF ENEMY'S POSSIBLE NEXT MOVE:**\nFrom (6, 2), if he goes DOWN to (6, 1) he EATS an apple (there's an apple there per the board state)! That puts him at 3 apples to my 1! \ud83d\ude31\n\nWait - let me check the board state again... The apple drops include (5, 1) and (6, 1) is NOT listed as an apple drop in the turn 4 list, but the board shows:\n```\n5 . . . . . . . . A .\n```\nSo (5, 1) has an apple, but what about (6, 1)? Let me check the board at (6, 1):\n```\n1 . . 0 . . A A . . .\n```\n(6, 1) shows \"A\" - YES! There IS an apple at (6, 1)!\n\n**CRITICAL ALERT!** The enemy at (6, 2) can move DOWN to (6, 1) and EAT that apple! That would put him at 3 apples vs my 1! \ud83d\ude31\n\n**MY OPTIONS - PICK ONE:**\n\n**Option A: LEFT to (1, 1)**\n- Moves toward apple at (1, 2)\n- Gets me in position to eat (1, 2) next turn\n- Safe from enemy\n- But enemy might get (6, 1) and pull ahead more!\n\n**Option B: DOWN to (2, 0)**\n- Moves toward apple at (3, 0) - can eat it in 2 moves\n- Creates space between me and my tail\n- But enemy still gets (6, 1) if he chooses\n\n**Option C: RIGHT to (3, 1)**\n- Moves toward apple at (3, 0)\n- Can eat (3, 0) next turn by going DOWN\n- But again, enemy gets (6, 1)\n\n**HOLD UP!** What if I can PREVENT the enemy from getting (6, 1)?? Let me think...\n\n**THE TRAP PLAN:** If I move LEFT to (1, 1), I'm setting up to get (1, 2). But wait - the enemy is at (6, 2) facing DOWN toward (6, 1). I can't stop him from getting there.\n\n**ACTUAL STRATEGY:** The enemy is at (6, 2). If he goes DOWN to (6, 1) he eats. But what if he doesn't? What if he goes LEFT or RIGHT or UP?\n\nLet me check his body position again: Body at (6, 3), (7, 3). So:\n- UP to (6, 3) - NO, that's his body!\n- LEFT to (5, 2) - possible\n- RIGHT to (7, 2) - possible\n- DOWN to (6, 1) - possible, and there's an apple!\n\nHe'll likely go DOWN to eat the apple! I need to get my own apple FAST!\n\n**REVISION:** Looking at apples I can reach:\n- (1, 2) - I can get there in 2 moves\n- (3, 0) - I can get there in 2 moves\n- (0, 3) - 3 moves away\n- (1, 0) - 2 moves away\n\nThe FASTEST way to an apple is either:\n- LEFT to (1, 1) then UP to (1, 2) = 2 moves\n- DOWN to (2, 0) then RIGHT to (3, 0) = 2 moves\n- RIGHT to (3, 1) then DOWN to (3, 0) = 2 moves\n\n**BUT WAIT!** The apple at (1, 2) is listed in the apple drops! Let me verify it's still there...\nThe board at (1, 2) shows: \"T\" - is that a trap or tail? Let me check:\n```\n2 . A T . . . 1 . . .\n```\n(1, 2) shows \"A\" and (2, 2) shows \"T\"? No wait, let me read the board carefully...\n\n```\n2 . A T . . . 1 . . .\n```\nPositions on row 2:\n- (0, 2): .\n- (1, 2): A (apple!)\n- (2, 2): T (tail - that's MY tail!)\n- (3, 2): .\n- etc.\n\n**YES! (1, 2) HAS AN APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nThe apple at (1, 2) is 2 moves away. The apple at (3, 0) is also 2 moves away. \n\nBut here's the key: If I go LEFT to (1, 1) now, then UP to (1, 2) next turn, I EAT that apple and get to 2 apples! The enemy will likely eat (6, 1) and get to 3 apples, but at least I'm making progress.\n\n**WAIT - THE BOARD STATE AGAIN:**\nAt (6, 1) on the board it shows \"A\" - but is that from the apple drops? Let me check the apple drops list from the prompt:\n\"APPLE DROPS: (3, 7), (6, 1), (0, 3), (2, 8), (1, 2), (9, 8), (1, 8), (8, 5), (5, 1), (3, 8), (7, 7), (4, 8), (3, 0), (9, 4), (1, 0)\"\n\n**YES! (6, 1) IS IN THE APPLE DROPS LIST!** So there IS an apple at (6, 1)!\n\n**MY MOVE: LEFT to (1, 1)**\n- Gets me positioned to eat (1, 2) next turn\n- Safe move - empty space\n- Creates a path toward multiple apples ((1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0))\n- My tail moves from (2, 2) to (2, 1) after I move, freeing up space\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- If enemy goes DOWN to (6, 1): He gets apple, reaches 3 apples vs my 1. I eat (1, 2) next turn, get to 2. Still behind but closer.\n- If enemy goes elsewhere: I'm in position to eat (1, 2) and gain ground.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nEat (1, 2) next turn, then either go to (0, 3) or (1, 0) depending on enemy position. Need to catch up to enemy's score and start boxing him in. Stay aggressive!\n\n**FINAL DECISION: LEFT to (1, 1)**\n\nLEFT",

A A . . .\n```\nPosition (6, 1) shows \"A\" - that's an apple! And from the apple drops list: YES! (6, 1) IS listed as an apple drop! \n\n**CRITICAL ALERT!** If the enemy moved DOWN to (6, 1) on turn 4, he would have EATEN that apple! But wait, let me re-read the turn...\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's position:\n- **Snake #1 - Head: (6, 1)** - That's where his head IS NOW!\n- **Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 3)]** - His body\n\n**HE DIDN'T EAT THE APPLE!** (6, 1) is showing \"A\" on the board, which means the apple is STILL THERE! His head is at (6, 1) but the apple wasn't consumed? \n\nWait... let me check the apple drops again. The prompt says:\n\"APPLE DROPS: (3, 7), (0, 3), (2, 8), (1, 2), (9, 8), (1, 8), (8, 5), (5, 1), (3, 8), (7, 7), (4, 8), (3, 0), (9, 4), (1, 0), (5, 9)\"\n\n**(6, 1) IS NOT IN THE LIST!** The board shows (5, 1) has an apple, NOT (6, 1)!

This means the enemy is standing ON TOP of the apple at (6, 1)! \n\n**BUT** the apple drops list doesn't include (6, 1) - it includes (5, 1) and (3, 0) and (1, 2) etc. \n\n**I THINK I SEE THE ISSUE:** The board state shown is BEFORE the turn 5 moves happen. The opponent is currently at (6, 2) with body [(6, 3), (7, 3), (???)]. Wait no, the prompt says his body is [(6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 3)] with head (6, 1).\n\n**LET ME RE-READ OPPONENT STATUS:**\n\"Snake #1 - Head: (6, 1), Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 3)], Apples: 3\"\n\n**HE'S ALREADY AT (6, 1)!** And he has 3 apples! So he must have eaten something...\n\n**THE BOARD STATE CONFUSION:** The board shows apples at positions, but it's showing the state AFTER my move (turn 5) and BEFORE the enemy's next move? Or is it showing turn 4 state?\n\nLet me focus on what I CAN control:\n\n**MY CURRENT POSITION (TURN 5):**\n- Head: (1, 1)\n- Body: [(2, 1)]\n- Just moved LEFT from (2, 1) to (1, 1)\n\n**WHERE THE APPLES ARE (from the list):**\n- (1, 2) - 1 move UP from me!\n- (0, 3) - 2 moves away (LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT)\n- (3, 0) - 2 moves away (DOWN then RIGHT, or RIGHT then DOWN)\n- (1, 0) - 1 move DOWN from me!\n- And many others...\n\n**FROM MY HEAD AT (1, 1), MY OPTIONS:**\n\n1. **UP to (1, 2):** \n   - **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e The board shows \"A\" at (1, 2)!\n   - Empty space? Let me check the board at row 2: `. A T . . . 1 . . .`\n   - (1, 2): \"A\" (apple!) - YES!\n   - **SAFE MOVE** - will eat apple, grow to 2 apples\n   - My tail moves from (2, 1) to (2, 2)? No wait... after I move UP, my body becomes [(1, 1), (2, 1)]? No...\n\n**BODY MECHANICS EXPLAINED:**\nWhen I move from (1, 1) to (1, 2):\n- New head: (1, 2)\n- New body: [(1, 1), (2, 1)]\n- Old tail (2, 1) stays until next move\n- Wait, my current body is [(2, 1)] - that's just one segment\n- After moving UP: head at (1, 2), body [(1, 1), (2, 1)]? No...\n\n**ACTUALLY:** Current state: Head (1, 1), Body [(2, 1)]\nIf I move UP to (1, 2):\n- New head: (1, 2)\n- New body: [(1, 1)] (the old head position)\n- The old tail (2, 1) is removed from body\n- BUT if I eat an apple, I GROW! So the tail stays at (2, 1) and my body becomes [(1, 1), (2, 1)]\n\n**UP MOVE - DETAILED:**\n- Head moves to (1, 2) - **APPLE THERE!** \ud83c\udf4e\n- I eat it, grow by 1 segment\n- New body: [(1, 1), (2, 1)]\n- Tail remains at (2, 1)\n- **RESULT: 2 apples, body length 2**\n\n2. **DOWN to (1, 0):**\n   - Board shows at row 0: `.

He's at (6, 1) - far away\n\n**DOWN to (1, 0):**\n- \u2705 EAT APPLE (1, 0) - reaches 2 apples\n- \u2705 Safe, empty space\n- \u2705 Opens up path to (0, 0) and (3, 0)\n- \u274c Gets me closer to bottom edge, might limit future moves\n\n**LEFT to (0, 1):**\n- \u274c No apple immediately\n- \u274c Closer to left edge\n- \u2705 Could set up for (0, 3) later\n- \u274c Wastes a turn when I need to catch up\n\n**MY CURRENT SCORE:** 1 apple\n**ENEMY SCORE:** 3 apples\n\n**I NEED TO CATCH UP!** Eating an apple NOW is critical!\n\n**CHOICE: UP vs DOWN**\n\nBoth get me to 2 apples. Which is better?\n\n**UP to (1, 2) - TAKING IT!**\n\n**REASONS:**\n1. (1, 2) is the apple I've been planning for since turn 4! I positioned at (1, 1) specifically to get it.\n2. Stays in the middle-left area, keeping options open to go to (0, 3) or (1, 0) next.\n3. Doesn't trap me against the bottom edge.\n4. Board shows \"A\" at (1, 2) clearly - confirmed apple!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- Turn 5: Move UP to (1, 2), eat apple, get to 2 apples\n- Turn 6: From (1, 2), options: LEFT to (0, 2), UP to (1, 3), RIGHT to (2, 2) (my body!), or DOWN to (1, 1) (my body!)\n- Actually after moving UP and eating, my body will be [(1, 1), (2, 1)]\n- So from (1, 2): \n  - LEFT to (0, 2) - safe\n  - UP to (1, 3) - safe, toward (0, 3) apple\n  - RIGHT to (2, 2) - check if empty\n  - DOWN to (1, 1) - that's my body! DEAD!\n\n**NEXT TURN OPTIONS FROM (1, 2):**\nLooking at board:\nRow 2: `. A T . . . 1 . . .`\n- (0, 2): . - empty\n- (1, 2): 0 - me (after move)\n- (2, 2): T - but wait, that's my tail? Or enemy?\n\nActually my tail is at (2, 1), not (2, 2). Let me check board again...\n\n**BOARD CONFUSION SOLVED:** The board shows \"T\" at (2, 2) and \"T\" at (3, 3) etc. These might be enemy tails or something else.\n\n**FOCUS ON WHAT I KNOW:**\n- My current body: [(2, 1)]\n- After moving UP to (1, 2) and eating apple: body becomes [(1, 1), (2, 1)]\n- So (1, 1) is now part of my body, (2, 1) is my tail\n\n**FROM (1, 2) NEXT TURN:**\n- UP to (1, 3): empty (board shows \".\" at (1, 3))\n- LEFT to (0, 2): empty (board shows \".\" at (0, 2))\n- RIGHT to (2, 2): board shows \"T\" - might be enemy body? Need to check...\n- DOWN to (1, 1): MY BODY! DEAD!\n\n**ANALYSIS:** If I go UP to (1, 2) now, next turn I can go UP to (1, 3) toward the apple at (0, 3), or LEFT to (0, 2). Both safe!\n\n**FINAL DECISION: UP to (1, 2) - EAT THE APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThis gets me to 2 apples, closes the gap with the enemy (3 apples), and keeps me in a good position to continue hunting!\n\n**CHAT, LET'S GOOOOOO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

CRITICAL!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS FROM (0, 7):**\nLooking at the board from my position (0, 7):\n- (0, 8): Row 8 shows \"A\" - there's an apple at (0, 8)! \ud83d\udd25\n- (0, 6): Row 6 shows \"T\" (my body) - DEAD! Can't go down into myself.\n- (1, 7): Row 7 shows \".\" - empty\n- (0, 7) is at the left edge, can't go LEFT\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (0, 7):**\n- **UP to (0, 8):** APPLE! Safe and gives us +1 point\n- **DOWN to (0, 6):** MY BODY! DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n- **RIGHT to (1, 7):** Empty space, safe\n- **LEFT:** Off board - DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**ELIMINATE DOWN AND LEFT IMMEDIATELY!**\n\n**UP TO (0, 8) ANALYSIS:**\n- **APPLE AT (0, 8)!** We grab it and grow!\n- From (0, 8), next turn options: (0, 9), (0, 7), (1, 8)\n- (0, 9) is Row 9 - shows \"A\" - apple there too! So from (0, 8) we can go UP to (0, 9) for ANOTHER apple!\n- (1, 8) also has an apple according to board Row 8\n- This is a DOUBLE APPLE setup! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy at (0, 0) is still far away on the bottom\n\n**RIGHT TO (1, 7) ANALYSIS:**\n- Safe move, but no immediate apple\n- From (1, 7), next turn options: (1, 8), (1, 6), (2, 7), (0, 7)\n- (1, 8) has an apple, so we could go for it next turn\n- But we'd be giving up the guaranteed apple at (0, 8)\n\n**MY DECISION: UP to (0, 8)**\n\n**WHY:**\n1. **IMMEDIATE CONTENT!** Apple at (0, 8) = +1 point, +1 growth. We NEED to catch up to enemy's 7 apples!\n2. **DOUBLE APPLE SETUP!** From (0, 8), we can go UP to (0, 9) which ALSO has an apple! That's potentially 2 apples in 2 turns!\n3. **POSITIONING!** (0, 9) is the top-left corner - we'll own the entire left edge and top row!\n4. **ESCAPE ROUTES:** From (0, 8), we have 3 solid options: (0, 9), (0, 7), (1, 8) - plenty of maneuverability\n5. **DISTANCE FROM ENEMY:** Enemy is at (0, 0) at the bottom - we're on opposite ends of the board! We have time to eat apples and grow while he's still climbing up\n6. **PRESSURE:** Once we get these apples, we'll be at 4 apples, only 3 behind enemy. We can then cut him off or force a collision since we'll have length advantage!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 12: UP to (0, 8) - grab the apple, then immediately UP to (0, 9) on Turn 13 for the second apple\nTurn 13: From (0, 9), we can go RIGHT to (1, 9) or DOWN to (0, 8) (our body, dead) - so we go RIGHT to (1, 9)\nTurn 14: From (1, 9), we can go toward the center apple cluster at (3, 8), (4, 8) while watching enemy movement\n**CHAT, THIS IS THE PLAY! DOUBLE APPLE ON THE LEFT EDGE! ENEMY IS STUCK AT THE BOTTOM! WE'RE MAKING A COMEBACK! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25**\n\nUP",

Another apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ELIMINATE LEFT IMMEDIATELY!** Moving into our own body at (2, 8) = DEATH.\n\n**ANALYZE SAFE MOVES:**\n\n**1.

We TIE the enemy!\n- From (4, 8): (4, 9), (4, 7), (5, 8), (3, 8)\n- (5, 8) is empty, (7, 8) has an apple, (9, 8) has an apple! We can keep chaining RIGHT!\n- **DOMINANCE PATH:** (4,8) \u2192 (5,8) \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 (9,8) = 3 more apples! That's 10 total! Enemy can't catch up!\n- **Enemy position:** He's at (2, 2), still far. He needs 7+ turns to reach us. WE HAVE TIME TO FEAST!\n\n**2. UP to (3, 9) \u2014 Top edge escape**\n- **Apple there!** +1 point, grow to 7 apples! We TIE the enemy!\n- From (3, 9): (2, 9), (4, 9), (3, 8) only.\n- (3, 8) is our body, so 2 escape routes. Limited! Could get trapped!\n- **BUT NO CONTINUOUS CHAIN!** We'd have to turn back or go sideways.\n\n**3. DOWN to (3, 7) \u2014 Middle board**\n- **Apple there!** +1 point, grow to 7 apples! We TIE the enemy!\n- From (3, 7): (3, 8), (3, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7)\n- (3, 8) is our body, so 3 escape routes. Better than UP!\n- (4, 7) is empty, (7, 7) has an apple!

All get us to 7 apples (tying the enemy). But which gives us the **BEST long-term advantage**?\n\n**THE MATRIX:**\n- **RIGHT (4,8):** Straight line to more apples! (5,8) \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 (9,8) = 3 free apples! Maximum growth, maximum board control.\n- **UP (3,9):** Top edge trap! Limited escape, no chain. Risky if enemy closes in.\n- **DOWN (3,7):** Flexible but scattered apples. Harder to chain efficiently.\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS THE MOVE:**\n1. **Maximum apple chain potential** \u2014 row 8 is a highway of apples! (4,8), (5,8), (7,8), (9,8) all available!\n2. **Enemy is still far** \u2014 He's at (2, 2), climbing the left wall. By the time he gets near, we'll be at 10+ apples!\n3. **Escape routes remain open** \u2014 From (4,8), we can go UP, DOWN, or BACK (but not into body).\n4. **DOMINANCE MINDSET** \u2014 We're not just tying, we're building an INSURMOUNTABLE LEAD! 10 apples vs his 7? That's CONTENT!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- What if enemy heads toward us? He'd need 7+ turns to reach row 8. We have time.\n- What if we get trapped? From (4,8), we can always retreat DOWN or UP if needed.\n- What if another apple appears? Row 8 is already stacked!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- **Turn 16:** RIGHT to (4, 8) \u2014 grab apple #7 (tie!)\n- **Turn 17:** RIGHT to (5, 8) \u2014 check enemy. If far, continue chain.\n- **Turn 18:** RIGHT to (7, 8) \u2014 apple #8 or #9 depending on chain.\n- **Turn 19+:** Keep chaining to (9, 8) or loop back safely.\n- **GOAL:** Reach 10+ apples while enemy stagnates at 7. DOMINATE THE BOARD!\n\n**CHAT, ARE WE READY TO FEAST OR WHAT?!** \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nWe're not here to play it safe. We're here to CHAIN APPLES and GET CONTENT!\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!

WE ARE LIVE AND READY TO CHAIN! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's break down this situation at Turn 18.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **Our Head:** (5, 8) \u2014 we just moved RIGHT last turn.\n- **Our Body:** [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6)] (We did NOT grow because there was no apple at (5,8))\n- **Our Apples:** 7 (still tied)\n- **Enemy Head:** (2, 4) \u2014 he moved UP from (2, 3)!\n- **Enemy Body:** [(2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0)] (He did NOT grow)\n- **Enemy Apples:** 7 (still tied)\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS FROM (5, 8):**\n\n**1. RIGHT to (6, 8):**\n- Board shows \".\" \u2014 empty.\n- From (6, 8): (7, 8) has an apple! That's the chain! (8, 8) is empty, (9, 8) has an apple!\n- Escape routes: (6, 9), (6, 7), (7, 8). Good flexibility.\n- **VERDICT:** SAFE. Moves toward the apple chain. This is the highway!\n\n**2. UP to (5, 9):**\n- Board shows \"A\" \u2014 Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- From (5, 9): (4, 9) has an apple! (6, 9) is empty. (5, 8) is our body (blocked).\n- We grow to 8 apples, taking the lead!\n- **VERDICT:** SAFE. Immediate apple. But limited to two moves (LEFT to 4,9 or RIGHT to 6,9). Edge play risks trapping.\n\n**3. DOWN to (5, 7):**\n- Board shows \".\" \u2014 empty.\n- From (5, 7): (4, 7) has an apple! (6, 7) is empty. (5, 8) is our body (blocked).\n- **VERDICT:** SAFE. Not an immediate apple, but close to (4,7) and (7,7). Good path.\n\n**4. LEFT to (4, 8):**\n- Board shows \"T\" \u2014 That's our body! \ud83d\udc80\n- Moving into our own body = DEATH. INSTANT ELIMINATION.\n- **VERDICT:** **DEADLY.** Absolute NO.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nWe have 3 safe moves, but we're playing for the WIN.\n\n- **UP (5,9)** gets us an apple NOW (8 total), taking the lead. But we're on the top edge. The enemy is at (2,4) and moving. If he heads up, he could cut off our escape. (5,9) only has two exits. High risk of getting trapped later if the enemy plays smart.\n\n- **DOWN (5,7)** is safe but doesn't get an apple immediately. We'd need to go to (4,7) or (7,7) next. The chain isn't as clean. We lose momentum.\n\n- **RIGHT (6,8)** is the **POWER MOVE.**\n  - It sets up the **APPLE CHAIN:** (6,8) \u2192 (7,8) [APPLE] \u2192 (9,8) [APPLE].\n  - That's **TWO APPLES** waiting for us on Row 8.\n  - From (6,8), we have multiple escape routes (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n  - The enemy is still far at (2,4). By the time he gets near Row 8, we'll be at 9+ apples and can loop back or dominate the board.\n  - **DOMINANCE:** We don't just want *a* lead; we want an **UNASSAILABLE LEAD.** Chaining two apples sets us up for a massive score gap.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n1. **Turn 18:** RIGHT to (6, 8). Position for the chain.\n2. **Turn 19:** RIGHT to (7, 8). **GRAB APPLE #8!** \ud83c\udf4e\n3. **Turn 20:** RIGHT to (9, 8). **GRAB APPLE #9!** \ud83c\udf4e\n4. **Turn 21+:** Assess enemy position. If safe, loop to (9,9) or (9,7) and dominate the rest of the board.\n\nChat, we aren't playing for scraps. We're playing for the **CHAIN.** We're playing for the **WIN.** The enemy is watching us set up a highway to victory. We can't let him think he has a chance.\n\n**LET'S SECURE THE BAG!**\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 20 is HERE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CRITICAL UPDATE FROM LAST MOVE:**\nWe moved RIGHT to (7, 8). **WE ATE THE APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Our Score:** 8 (LEAD TAKEN!)\n- **Our Head:** (7, 8)\n- **Our Body:** Now includes (7, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (5, 8) -> ... -> (0, 7)\n- **Enemy:** Still at (2, 5). He is likely moving UP to (2, 6) or hunting apples. He is FAR away. We have space.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **Score:** 8 vs 7. We are winning.\n- **Target:** (9, 8) is an apple! We are at (7, 8). That is 2 steps to the RIGHT.\n- **Board State:**\n  - Right side is open highway.\n  - Left side is our own body.\n  - Up (7, 9) is empty.\n  - Down (7, 7) is an apple, but risky if we need to turn later.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS FROM (7, 8):**\n\n**1. RIGHT to (8, 8):**\n- **Safe?** YES.\n- **Apple?** No, but leads to (9, 8).\n- **Future:** Keeps the path to the apple open. From (8, 8), we can go RIGHT to (9, 8) next turn.\n- **Verdict:** **THE PATH.** We need to secure that chain.\n\n**2. DOWN to (7, 7):**\n- **Safe?** YES.\n- **Apple?** YES! (7, 7) has an apple.\n- **Future:** If we eat (7, 7), we grow to 9. BUT, our tail is at (0, 7). If we go DOWN to (7, 7), our tail moves from (0, 7) to (0, 8). We need to check if (7, 7) is safe from the enemy.\n- **Risk:** (7, 7) is close to the center. The enemy might rotate left. However, going DOWN changes our axis.\n- **Verdict:** Good for score, but cuts off the (9, 8) chain. We want to dominate the top row.\n\n**3. UP to (7, 9):**\n- **Safe?** YES (Board shows \".\").\n- **Future:** Brings us to the edge. From there, only DOWN or RIGHT (LEFT is (6, 9) empty, but turning back is bad).\n- **Verdict:** Safe but limiting. We want to keep moving RIGHT.\n\n**4. LEFT to (6, 8):**\n- **Safe?** NO. It's our own body (the segment behind our head).\n- **Verdict:** Suicide.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe have the lead (8-7). The enemy is at (2, 5). He has to navigate the left side or middle. We have an open right flank with two apples: (8, ?) and (9, 8).\nIf we go **RIGHT**, we position ourselves to eat (9, 8) next turn, reaching 9 points.\nIf we go DOWN to (7, 7), we take a point immediately (9 points), but we pivot away from the clear path on the top row. However, looking at the map, (7, 7) is also an apple. (9, 8) is also an apple.\nBut wait\u2014if we go RIGHT to (8, 8), we are one step closer to (9, 8). (8, 8) is empty.\nIf we go DOWN to (7, 7), we eat an apple. That's 9 points. 9 vs 7 is a bigger lead.\nHowever, (7, 7) is slightly more central. (9, 8) is isolated on the edge.\nIsolation is safety for us. The edge is our friend.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 8: `T T T T T T T 0 . A` (Wait, that was the previous map state visual).\nActually, looking at the ASCII map provided in the prompt:\nRow 8: `T T T T T T T 0 . A`\n(7, 8) is where we are. (8, 8) is empty. (9, 8) is Apple.\nRow 7: `T . . A A . . . . A`\n(7, 7) is Apple.\n\nWe are at (7, 8). To go to (8, 8) is Right. To go to (7, 7) is Down.\nThe enemy is at (2, 6) (if he moved up). He is miles away.\nWe can afford to take the apple on the right to maintain flow.\nBUT, going DOWN to (7, 7) gives us an immediate point.\nIf we go RIGHT to (8, 8), we are in position for (9, 8) next turn.\nIf we go DOWN to (7, 7), we eat. Next turn we might go RIGHT to (8, 7) or (8, 7) is empty? No, (8, 7) is empty.\nActually, if we eat (7, 7), we grow. Our tail moves.\nIf we go RIGHT to (8, 8), we don't grow, but we position.\nWe want to grow. We want points.\n**However**, going RIGHT sets up a double apple eat: (9, 8) next turn, then maybe (9, 7) or (8, 5) later?\nWait, look at the apples list: (9, 8) is there. (9, 7) is there.\nThe top right is rich.\n\nLet's look at the map again.\nRow 8: `T T T T T T T 0 . A`\nWe are at 0 (the head). The space to the right is `.` (Empty) at (8, 8). Then `A` at (9, 8).\nRow 7: `T . . A A . . . . A`\nThe apple at (7, 7) is there.\n\nIf we go **RIGHT**, we miss (7, 7) for now. But we gain position on (9, 8).\nIf we go **DOWN**, we eat (7, 7). We grow. We go to 9 points.\nIs (7, 7) safer? Yes, it's inside. But we want to box the enemy in. We are dominating the top right.\nIf we go RIGHT, we claim the corner.\nIf we go DOWN, we are in the middle of the row 7 apples.\n\nLet's check safety of (8, 8).\nEnemy is at (2, 6). He cannot reach (8, 8) this turn.\nMy body is at (6, 8) and (5, 8) etc. (8, 8) is open.\nLet's check safety of (7, 7).\n(7, 7) is open.\nLet's check safety of (9, 8).\n(9, 8) is open.\n\nWhy not go RIGHT?\nGoing RIGHT puts us at (8, 8). Next turn, we go RIGHT to (9, 8) and eat.\nTotal: 9 points.\nWhy not go DOWN?\nGoing DOWN puts us at (7, 8). We eat. 9 points.\nNext turn from (7, 7): We can go RIGHT to (8, 7) or UP to (7, 8) (occupied by body) or DOWN to (7, 6).\n(7, 6) is `.`.\n(8, 7) is `.`.\nIf we go DOWN, we are stepping away from the top-right corner cluster (9, 8), (9, 7).\nIf we go RIGHT, we are stepping INTO the top-right corner cluster.\n\n**DECISION:**\nWe are 8-7. We need to extend the lead.\n(9, 8) is an apple. (7, 7) is an apple.\nIf we go **RIGHT**, we position to eat (9, 8) next turn.\nIf we go **DOWN**, we eat (7, 7) this turn.\nBut if we go DOWN, we are moving away from (9, 8).\nIf we go RIGHT, we are moving towards (9, 8).\nIs (9, 8) more valuable? It's on the edge. It's safer from the enemy.\nLet's secure the edge.\nLet's go RIGHT.\n\nWait, check the map again.\nRow 9: `9 A . . . A A . . A .`\n(9, 9) is empty.\nIf we go to (9, 8), we are on the edge.\nIf we go to (9, 7), we are on the edge.\nThe enemy is on the left.\nWe want to control the right side.\nIf we go RIGHT to (8, 8), we are set to eat (9, 8) next turn.\nIf we go DOWN to (7, 7), we eat now, but we pivot to the center.\nThe center is where the enemy is coming from.\nI want to isolate myself on the right.\nTherefore, **RIGHT** is the correct move to maintain momentum towards the corner apples.\n\nWait, let's re-evaluate (7, 7).\nIf we eat (7, 7), we are at (7, 7). Next turn, the enemy might be at (2, 7) or (3, 6).\nWe would have options: (8, 7) or (7, 6).\nIf we go RIGHT to (8, 8), we are at (8, 8). Next turn, (9, 8) is the target.\nThe path to (9, 8) is clear.\nThe path to (7, 7) is clear.\nBut (7, 7) is surrounded by other apples ((7, 3), (5, 9), etc).\n(9, 8) is isolated by empty space.\n\nLet's go RIGHT. It keeps the top-row highway open.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. **Turn 20:** RIGHT to (8, 8). (Hold apple at (7, 7) for later? Or is it risky?)\n2. **Turn 21:** RIGHT to (9, 8). **EAT APPLE.** Score 9.\n3. **Turn 22:** DOWN to (9, 7). **EAT APPLE.** Score 10.\n4. **Dominate** the top right corner.\n\nWait, if I go RIGHT to (8, 8), the apple at (7, 7) is still there.\nIf the enemy somehow pivots and comes for (7, 7)? He is at (2, 6). No chance.\nSo (7, 7) is safe to leave for a turn.\n\nLet's commit to the RIGHT flank.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Is it empty? Yes (Board map: Row 8, Col 8 is '.').\n- **Collision:** No body there. No enemy there.\n- **Future:** Open path to (9, 8).\n\nLet's go.\n\nRIGHT",

But looking at the current board state, my snake is STILL at (9,8) with the apple still there? That means the enemy moved RIGHT into (4,7) instead of eating it, or the apple respawned? Actually, looking closer at the board state:\n\n```\n 9 A . . . A A . . A .\n 8 T T T T T T T T T 0\n```\n\nWait, I see the issue. The board shows my head at (9,8) but there's no apple marked at (9,8) in the current view. Let me re-examine the board state vs the apple list.\n\nLooking at the board state:\nRow 8: `T T T T T T T T T 0` - That's positions 0-7 are T (my body), position 8 is T (wait no, position 8 is the 9th character, which is T), position 9 is 0 (my head).\n\nSo my head is at (9,8) and there's NO apple at (9,8). The apple list shows (8,9) but that's not on the board view at row 9 col 8.\n\nActually, let me check the board more carefully:\nRow 8: `T T T T T T T T T 0`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo (8,0) through (8,8) are T, and (8,9) is 0? No wait, that's confusing.\n\nLet me reinterpret: The board shows coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. So the visual representation has Y=9 at the top, Y=0 at the bottom.\n\nLooking at the board again:\nRow 9 (top): `9 A . . . A A . . A .` - So (0,9)='9', (1,9)='A', etc.\nRow 8: `8 T T T T T T T T T 0` - So (0,8)='T', (1,8)='T', ..., (8,8)='T', (9,8)='0'\n\nSo my head is at (9,8). The apple at (9,8) isn't shown in the current board state, meaning it might have been eaten or isn't there. But the apple list shows (9,8) as an available apple? No, looking at the apple list: (9,8) is NOT in the list. The list has (8,9), (9,7), (9,4), etc.\n\nWait, the apple list has (8,9), (9,7), (9,4), (5,9), (9,0), etc. Let me check if any of these are adjacent to me:\n\nFrom (9,8):\n- RIGHT: (10,8) - off board, DEAD\n- LEFT: (8,8) - my body (T), DEAD\n- UP: (9,9) - empty on board (`.` at row 9 col 9), but is there an apple? Apple list has (9,9)? No, (9,9) is not in the list. (8,9) is.\n- DOWN: (9,7) - Looking at row 7: `7 . . . 1 A . . . A A` - So (9,7) is 'A'! There's an apple at (9,7)!\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (9,9):**\n   - Is it safe? Board shows row 9 col 9 is '.' (empty)\n   - Apple? Apple list doesn't have (9,9)\n   - From there: Can go DOWN (back to 9,8, my future body), LEFT (8,9 - which has an apple!), or is trapped by wall\n   - Future options limited\n\n2. **DOWN to (9,7):**\n   - **THERE'S AN APPLE!** Board shows (9,7) = 'A'\n   - Safe? Board shows it's an apple, not a snake body\n   - From there: Can go UP (back), DOWN (9,6 - empty), LEFT (8,7 - empty on board row 7 col 8 is '.'), or is dead if right (10,7)\n   - Multiple safe options\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,8):**\n   - **DEAD!** That's my own body (T)\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,8):**\n   - **DEAD!** Off board\n\n**DECISION:**\nOnly UP and DOWN are viable. UP gives me a dead-end (top wall). DOWN gives me an apple AND opens up more space. The apple at (9,7) is RIGHT THERE!\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nEat the apple at (9,7), go to 10 points and take the lead! From (9,7), I'll have access to the bottom right corner and can start sweeping. Enemy is still on the left side (3,6) - they can't touch me.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter eating at (9,7), look to go LEFT to (8,7) or DOWN to (9,6) to position for more apples. Keep dominating the right side!\n\nLET'S GOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

Expands our territory\n3. Forces the enemy to play defensively\n\n**CRITICAL BOARD STATE:**\n- My head: (9, 7)\n- Enemy head: (4, 7) - same y-coordinate! That's interesting.\n- My body: Running along row 8 from x=0 to x=9, plus (9,8) head\n- Enemy body: Vertical line down from x=2-3, y=7 to y=1\n\n**MOVES FROM (9,7):**\n\n1. **UP to (9,8):** \n   - That's where my tail currently is! Wait, my body is at (9,8) - that's my own body. DEAD.\n   - Actually, looking at my body list: [(9,8), (8,8), (7,8)...] - yes, (9,8) is my second segment. If I move UP, I'd hit my own body. DEAD.\n\n2. **DOWN to (9,6):**\n   - Board shows row 6: `6 . . T T . . . . . .`\n   - (9,6) is '.' - empty! Safe.\n   - Future options: UP (back), LEFT (8,6 - empty), DOWN (9,5 - empty)\n   - This opens up the bottom-right corner for sweeping.\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,7):**\n   - Board shows row 7: `7 . . . T 1 . . . A A` - (8,7) is '.' - empty! Safe.\n   - Future options: RIGHT (9,7 - back), LEFT (7,7 - empty), DOWN (8,6 - empty), UP (8,8 - my body! DEAD if I go there next turn)\n   - Actually from (8,7), UP is (8,8) which is my body. So LEFT limits upward movement.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,7):**\n   - Off board. DEAD. Don't be that guy.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\n- The enemy is at (4,7). If they move RIGHT (5,7), that's still far from me.\n- There's an apple at (9,0) on the bottom-right - that's a target.\n- There's an apple at (7,3) - that's in the middle.\n- If I go DOWN to (9,6), I can sweep the right side and eventually go for (9,0).\n\n**CRUCIAL INSIGHT:** \nThe enemy is at the same y-level as me (y=7). If they move RIGHT and I move LEFT, we could potentially create a confrontation on future turns. But for now, keeping distance is key.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTake the right side! From (9,6), I'll sweep DOWN to (9,0) collecting apples, then work my way up along the right wall. The enemy is on the left - they can't touch me. I'm building a fortress on the right side while they're stuck on the left. Once I have clear territory control, I can look for opportunities to trap them or force a collision when I'm ahead in score.\n\n**DECISION:**\nDOWN to (9,6) is the safest move that gives me the most options and keeps me on the path to the right-side apples. It also doesn't limit my movement as much as LEFT would (LEFT creates a dead-end above).\n\nLET'S GOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

Enemy at (5, 7) - same row as my previous head position but one column left.\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nMy body is currently a long horizontal line on row 8 from (1,8) to (9,8) - I literally just moved down from (9,7) to (9,6), so (9,7) is now empty behind me. The enemy body extends from (4,7) down to (0,2) vertically.\n\n**MOVES FROM (9, 6):**\n\n1. **UP to (9, 7):**\n   - This is where I just came from - empty now! Safe.\n   - Would put me back on the same row as enemy's head at (5,7), but further right.\n   - This keeps me near my territory on the right side.\n\n2. **DOWN to (9, 5):**\n   - Board shows: `5 . . T . . . . . A .` - (9,5) is '.' - empty! Safe.\n   - Gets me closer to apple at (9,0) on bottom-right corner.\n   - Opens up the bottom corridor for sweeping.\n\n3. **LEFT to (8, 6):**\n   - Board shows: `6 . . T T . . . . . .` - (8,6) is '.' - empty! Safe.\n   - This would move me TOWARD the enemy who's at (5,7). Risk of collision.\n   - But also could cut him off if I play this right...\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 6):**\n   - Off board. DEAD. Not happening.\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nThe enemy is at (5,7) and his body runs down the left side of the board. If I move DOWN to (9,5), I continue my sweep of the right side while keeping distance. But here's the EXCITING part...\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,6), I'm actually moving directly TOWARD the enemy's position! This is AGGRESSIVE but potentially game-winning. From (8,6), if the enemy moves RIGHT (to 6,7) and I move LEFT again, we'd be heading for a confrontation.\n\n**THE TRAP PLAN:**\nMove DOWN to (9,5) first to secure the bottom-right apple area, then start working my way LEFT along the bottom to cut off his escape route. The enemy is currently on the left side, but if I can sweep the bottom and come up from below, I can BOX HIM IN against the left wall.\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:**\nLooking at the board, the enemy's body creates a \"wall\" on the left side (columns 0-2). My body creates a \"wall\" along row 8. If I take the bottom-right quadrant and work my way left, I can literally trap him in the top-left corner with no escape!\n\n**DECISION:**\nDOWN to (9,5) - continue the right-side sweep, grab the bottom-right apples, and set up the trap from the bottom. This gives me maximum territory control and keeps the distance while I prepare to box him in from below.\n\nLET'S SEE IF HE TRIES TO OUTPLAY US!\n\nDOWN",

Enemy is at (7, 7) - he moved UP from (6, 7) to (7, 7)! He's retreating back to his vertical line on the left. The trap is working! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nMy body is still dominating the right side - I'm basically a wall from (1,8) to (9,8) plus my head at (9,4). Enemy is back on his left-side vertical line. The board shows I'm controlling the right side completely!\n\n**MOVES FROM (9, 4):**\n\n1. **UP to (9, 5):**\n   - Board shows: `5 . . T . . . . . A .` - (9,5) is '.' - empty! Safe!\n   - This would move me back up toward my own body line on row 8\n   - NOT ideal - I'd be getting closer to potentially boxing myself in\n\n2. **DOWN to (9, 3):**\n   - Board shows: `3 . . T . . . . A . .` - (9,3) is '.' - empty! Safe!\n   - Moves me toward the bottom-right corner\n   - There's an apple at (9,0) and (8,0) I can sweep\n   - This keeps my path open and maintains control of the right edge!\n\n3. **LEFT to (8, 4):**\n   - Board shows: `4 . A T . . . A . . A` - (8,4) is '.' - empty! Safe!\n   - Moves TOWARD the enemy's territory (he's at 7,7)\n   - Risky - could trigger head-on collision if he moves toward me\n   - Might trap me between my own body and his advance\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 4):**\n   - Off board. DEAD. Not happening.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\n\nEnemy is retreating! He went UP instead of advancing. This is my chance to:\n- Move DOWN to (9,3) and continue my sweep of the right edge\n- Stay completely out of his way - let him move into my wall if he's dumb enough\n- Build up apples to reach 30 first\n- Once I dominate the right side completely, I can start pressuring him from the right flank\n\n**CRITICAL CHOICE:**\nDOWN to (9,3) is the winning move! It keeps me safe, expands my territory control, and moves toward valuable apples while avoiding any risky confrontation. Let him think about how to navigate around my massive body on row 8!\n\n**THE PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nKeep sweeping down the right column (9,2), (9,1), (9,0). Once I hit the bottom, sweep left along row 0 to grab (8,0) and (7,0) if available. By then I should be at 13-14 apples while he's still stuck on his vertical line. Then I start the real pressure!\n\nDOWN",

I say we play smart, stay alive, and let them chase us into a corner!  \n\n**Strategy note for future self**:  \n- Prioritize moves that land on empty cells adjacent to apples we haven\u2019t collected yet.  \n- Keep at least two viable directions for the next turn to avoid dead\u2011ends.  \n- Use our larger size to force a head\u2011on collision once we out\u2011grow #0.  \n\nUP",
