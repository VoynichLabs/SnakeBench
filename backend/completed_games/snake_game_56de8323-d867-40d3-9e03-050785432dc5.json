My priority should be to maintain my lead by picking up the apples in the (6, y) and (7, y) columns.\n\nStarting with the apple at (6, 8) or (7, 6) is the most efficient. I will move DOWN.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\n1. Move DOWN to reach (7, 8), then navigate toward (6, 8) or (7, 6).\n2. Continue collecting the dense cluster of apples on the right side of the board (columns 5, 6, and 7).\n3. Monitor Snake #0 as it grows and potentially moves toward the center.\n\nDOWN",

Moves towards the center/left side.\n*   **RIGHT:** (7, 8). **INVALID.** This is my neck/body.\n\n**2. Evaluate Future Scenarios:**\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:** Currently at (4, 3). It is near several apples (3, 4), (5, 2), (2, 4), (0, 4). Since it has no body segments yet, it is highly mobile.\n*   **Targeting Apples:** There is a large cluster of apples in the lower right quadrant: (7, 6), (7, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0).\n*   **My Tail:** My tail is at (7, 9).

This move keeps me in a central-right position where I can contest the apples before Snake #0 reaches them.\n*   **LEFT (5, 8):** This moves me towards (4, 7), which is a decent option, but it brings me closer to the enemy's potential path if they move upward.\n*   **UP (6, 9):** Pushes me against the wall and limits my vertical maneuvering.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** to (6, 7) is the strongest move. It places me in a position to sweep through the apple-rich bottom-right corner. I have a lead (2 apples to 0) and want to maintain it by securing the closest clusters. I will monitor Snake #0 (4, 3) to ensure I don't set up a head-on collision at (5, 4) or similar if we both converge on the center.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\n1. Move DOWN towards (6, 7).\n2.

Evaluate Strategy:**\n*   My immediate goal is to stay ahead in apples (currently 2 to 0).\n*   The closest apple is (7, 6).\n*   If I move **RIGHT** to (7, 7), I am one step away from apple (7, 6).\n*   If I move **DOWN** to (6, 6), I am also one step away from apple (7, 6).\n*   Move **RIGHT** to (7, 7) keeps my body more aligned with the wall, which is generally safer for space management as I grow. However, (7, 6) is directly below (7, 7). \n*   Let's look at apple (4, 7). If I move **LEFT** to (5, 7), I am one step from (4, 7).\n*   Move **RIGHT** to (7, 7) is good because it positions me to sweep the right column and bottom cluster.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\nI will move **RIGHT** to (7, 7). This prepares me to take (7, 6) next turn while staying away from the center where the enemy is currently maneuvering. It keeps me in a strong position to contest the right-side cluster.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\n1. Move to (7, 7), then (7, 6) to eat the apple.\n2. Continue moving down the 7th or 6th column to harvest the dense apple field in the bottom right corner (7, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), etc.\n3. Keep an eye on Snake #0's growth; since it has no tail yet, its movement is less restricted but it will grow as soon as it eats.\n\nRIGHT",

Snake 0 is already in that area.

This is moving directly backward into my own body. **INVALID**.\n2. **DOWN**: (9, 1). This moves onto an apple. Safe. My tail at (7, 6) will move to (8, 6).\n3. **LEFT**: (8, 2). Safe. However, (9, 1) is a direct point and keeps me on the perimeter.\n4. **RIGHT**: (10, 2). Off board. **INVALID**.\n\nStrategic Analysis:\n- Moving DOWN to (9, 1) secures another apple and keeps me along the right wall. \n- The enemy head at (4, 2) is too far to contest (9, 1).\n- After (9, 1), the next logical targets are (7, 1) and (7, 0). \n- I must be careful not to get boxed against the right wall by my own growing body, but currently, my tail is moving away from the area I am entering.\n\nLong-term Plan:\nCollect the apple at (9, 1). Then proceed to (7, 1) and (7, 0). This clears the bottom right corner of apples and maintains a lead over Snake 0. Always check the position of Snake 0's head as it moves toward the center or the bottom.\n\nDOWN",

I have a long tail trailing along the right wall (x=9). This tail is slowly clearing out, but I should be careful not to trap myself between my body and the enemy later.\n\nLong-term Plan:\nTake the apple at (7, 1). From there, assess if (7, 0) or (7, 3) is the better next target. Snake 0 is likely to head toward (3, 4) or (2, 4). I want to maintain my lead and keep my movement path open toward the left side of the board where many apples are clustered.\n\nLEFT",

However, my body is currently wrapped around the right side and bottom right. Moving to (7, 0) is safe and efficient for scoring. Snake 0 is four steps away from (7, 3) and five steps away from (7, 0), so I am not in immediate danger of a head-on collision at (7, 0).\n\nLong-term Plan:\nEat the apple at (7, 0). Then, rotate back UP or LEFT to contest (7, 3) or move toward the dense apple cluster on the left side of the board. Keep an eye on Snake 0; they are currently focused on the center-left. Ensure I don't get trapped against my own tail which is currently occupying (8, 5)-(9, 5).\n\nDOWN",

However, my tail covers (9, 1), so I'd be momentarily boxed in unless I loop back.\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 0): I move toward the cluster of apples on the left. The enemy tail is at (6, 0) and will move this turn, making the spot safe. \n\nLooking at the apples: (7, 3) and (6, 4) are the closest. To get to (7, 3) from (7, 0), I can't go straight UP. I must go LEFT then UP-UP-UP, or RIGHT-RIGHT then UP then circle back. Moving LEFT is more direct for (7, 3) and keeps me away from the corner/wall trap.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT toward the center. This opens up paths to (7, 3) and (6, 4) while keeping me mobile. Avoid the bottom-right corner (8,0)/(9,0) for now as my own body at (9,1) creates a temporary barrier.\n\nLEFT",

The board center is relatively clear for me, while the enemy is currently restricted near the left wall. I will prioritize the cluster at (5, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8).\n\nUP",

Length grows to 13.\n- DOWN to (5, 4): INVALID (Backwards/Body).\n- LEFT to (4, 5): Safe. Moves toward (4, 7) and (0, 2).\n- RIGHT to (6, 5): Safe. Moves toward (7, 5).\n\nEvaluation:\n- UP (5, 6) is the strongest move. It secures an apple immediately and places the snake in a position to contest the dense apple cluster at (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (2, 7), (2, 8). \n- Enemy Snake (ID 0) is currently at (0, 7). From (0, 7), the enemy cannot reach (5, 6) this turn. The closest the enemy head could be next turn is (1, 7) or (0, 8), both of which are far from (5, 6).\n- The enemy's body blocks most of the 4th row (x=4) and 0th column (x=0), but my head is in open space.\n- Moving UP allows me to stay ahead in the score and maintain control over the top-center area of the board.\n\nStrategy Note:\nGrabbing (5, 6) this turn. Next, look to secure (5, 8) or (4, 7). Be mindful of the enemy moving toward the (2,7)/(2,8) cluster. My body is currently coiled at the bottom right; heading upwards keeps me away from my own tail and gives me more room to maneuver.\n\nUP",

Length: 12.\n- Apples nearby: (4, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (2, 7), (2, 8), (7, 5).\n\nEvaluation of Moves for Snake 1:\n- UP to (5, 7): Safe. Moves closer to apples at (5, 8), (4, 7), and (4, 8). It also blocks Snake 0 from easily crossing into the right side of the board.\n- DOWN to (5, 5): INVALID (Backwards).\n- LEFT to (4, 6): Safe. Puts you near (4, 7), but it's deeper into the territory Snake 0 is approaching.\n- RIGHT to (6, 6): Safe.

By moving UP to (5, 7), I position myself to grab (5, 8) or (4, 8) while maintaining height on the board. (5, 7) is a strong central position that allows me to react to Snake 0's movements. Snake 0 cannot reach (5, 7) this turn (it's 5 tiles away). I am currently leading 12-11.\n\nPlan:\nMove UP to (5, 7).

Puts me in a position to grab (4, 9) or move toward the clusters at (8, 9) or (9, 9).\n- DOWN to (5, 7): INVALID (Backwards).\n- LEFT to (4, 8): Safe and eats an apple. This moves me closer to Snake 0 (Head at 2, 8). If I move to (4, 8), and Snake 0 moves to (3, 8), we will be adjacent.\n- RIGHT to (6, 8): Safe and eats an apple. This is the safest way to increase my score while maintaining distance from the enemy.\n\nStrategic Analysis:\nSnake 0 is currently in the top-left quadrant and has just eaten the apple at (2, 8). There are apples at (3, 8) and (4, 8) between us. If I move LEFT to (4, 8), I am competing directly for (3, 8). However, moving RIGHT to (6, 8) is a guaranteed point and keeps my head away from his. My body currently segments the board, and I want to maintain control of the right side where several apples [(9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 5), (7, 3), (9, 9), (8, 9)] are located. \n\nBy moving RIGHT to (6, 8), I secure a point and can then look to move UP toward the (8, 9)/(9, 9) cluster or stay along the right wall. This path is less contested.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT to (6, 8) to secure an apple. Then, consider moving UP or further RIGHT depending on Snake 0's movement toward the center.\n\nRIGHT",

I need to be careful of Snake 0's potential head-on if we both head for that corner.\n- If I go DOWN to (7, 6): I can reach (7, 5), (8, 6), and (9, 6) more efficiently.\n- If I go RIGHT to (8, 7): I maintain a buffer from both my body and the enemy.\n\nCurrent body layout: I have a long vertical wall on x=6. Snake 0 is trapped in the top-left quadrant mostly, but has access to the top row.\nThe cluster (7, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6) is very close and less likely to be contested by Snake 0 immediately because he is at y=9.\n\nI will move RIGHT to (8, 7). This keeps me away from the wall at x=6, avoids immediate head-on threats at y=8/9, and positions me perfectly to sweep the apples at (8, 6), (9, 6), and (7, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

Moves closer to (9, 6) and (9, 9).\n\nEnemy Evaluation:\nSnake #0 is at (3, 9). He can move LEFT to (2, 9) or RIGHT to (4, 9) (Wait, (4,9) is his body, so his moves from (3,9) are restricted to LEFT (2,9) or potentially RIGHT if (4,9) was the tail, but (4,9) is his current position 1, so it is not his tail). Actually, looking at his body: [(4, 9), (4, 8), ...], his tail is at (4, 4). He can move LEFT to (2, 9) or UP/DOWN. Since (3, 8) is his body, he likely moves LEFT/RIGHT.\n\nStrategy:\nMove DOWN to (8, 6). This secures an apple immediately, increasing the score to 16 and length to 16. My tail at (7, 1) will move once I eat the apple, effectively keeping my length the same until the next turn's growth. This path also leads toward (9, 6) and (7, 5). Snake 0 is far enough away at the top that (8, 6) is completely safe from a head-on.\n\nPlan:\n1. Move to (8, 6) to eat the apple.\n2. Target (9, 6) or (7, 5) next depending on apple respawns and enemy movement.\n3. Keep an eye on the right wall to ensure I don't get trapped against my own long vertical tail at x=6/7.\n\nDOWN",

Moves towards apples at (8, 9) and (9, 9).\n- DOWN (9, 5): Safe. Moves towards (7, 5) and (8, 0).\n- LEFT (8, 6): INVALID. This is your own body (the neck).\n- RIGHT (10, 6): INVALID. Off the board.\n\nStrategy:\nGoing UP to (9, 7) leads toward a corner with two apples (8, 9) and (9, 9). However, once those are eaten, you will be in a very tight pocket against the enemy snake's tail/body area if he moves right. \nGoing DOWN to (9, 5) provides more open space. From (9, 5), you can target the apple at (7, 5) or continue down the right edge to get (8, 0).\nYour current body is quite long and forms a wall in the center. \n\nRisk Assessment:\nSnake #0 is currently at (1, 9) and moving left or down (since right is blocked by its own body). It is no immediate threat to you on the right side.\nThe move DOWN (9, 5) is safer for long-term navigation as it avoids the (9, 9) corner for now, allowing you to loop back for those later or take them if you have a clear exit. However, the apples at (9, 9) and (8, 9) are high value. \n\nLet's look at UP: (9, 6) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 9) -> (8, 9). After eating (8, 9), your head would be at (8, 9). You would then need to move to (7, 9) or (8, 8). Both are currently clear. This seems viable and nets two quick points.\n\nLet's look at DOWN: (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (7, 5). This gets one apple and keeps you central.\n\nDecision:\nUP is attractive to secure the lead. Since Snake #0 is far away (top left), the corner isn't a trap yet.\n\nPlan:\n1. Move UP to (9, 7).\n2. Follow the wall to (9, 9) and (8, 9).\n3. Be careful not to get pinned if Snake #0 moves toward the top right.\n\nUP",

From (0, 9), his only move is DOWN to (0, 8) (once the tail moves) or he is trapped. No, he is at (0, 9), he can't go left or up. He can only go DOWN.\n\nMy move is UP.\n\nUP",
