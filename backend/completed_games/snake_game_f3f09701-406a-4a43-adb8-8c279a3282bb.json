Possible moves:\n1. **UP**: (8,7) - Valid (within bounds).\n2. **DOWN**: (8,5) - Valid.\n3. **LEFT**: (7,6) - Valid.\n4. **RIGHT**: (9,6) - Valid (since x=9 is within bounds).\n\n**Check for collisions:**\n- Your body is empty, so no risk of hitting yourself.\n- Enemy head is at (6,9), which is not adjacent to (8,6), so no immediate collision risk.\n- No other snakes are present, so no other collision risks.\n\n### **Apple Reachability and Prioritization**\n- The apple at (8,1) is directly below your head (DOWN move).\n- The apple at (7,2) is diagonally down-left from (8,6), but you cannot move diagonally. The closest you can get is (7,6) (LEFT) or (8,5) (DOWN).\n- The apple at (4,5) is reachable but far away; not a priority yet.\n- The apple at (3,6) is reachable but also far away.\n\n**Best immediate apple target:** (8,1) via DOWN.\n\n### **Future Moves and Strategy**\n- If you move DOWN to (8,5), you can then move DOWN again to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), etc., to reach (8,1).\n- However, moving DOWN to (8,5) is safe and directly toward the apple at (8,1).\n- Moving LEFT to (7,6) is also safe but does not immediately bring you closer to any apple.\n- Moving UP to (8,7) or RIGHT to (9,6) does not help reach any apple immediately.\n\n### **Enemy Movement Considerations**\n- Enemy head is at (6,9). It could move DOWN to (6,8), LEFT to (5,9), etc.\n- If you move DOWN to (8,5), the enemy could move LEFT to (5,9) or DOWN to (6,8), but no immediate collision risk.\n- If you move LEFT to (7,6), the enemy could move LEFT to (5,9), but no immediate threat.\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- No immediate threats from the enemy.\n- Moving DOWN to (8,5) is the safest and most direct path to the apple at (8,1).\n- Moving LEFT to (7,6) is safe but does not help reach an apple immediately.\n\n### **Long-Term Plan**\n1. Prioritize reaching the apple at (8,1) by moving DOWN.\n2. After collecting the apple, explore toward the apple at (7,2) or (3,6) depending on enemy movements.\n3. Avoid getting trapped in the top-right corner; try to spread out to avoid collisions.\n4. Keep an eye on the enemy's head position to avoid potential future collisions.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe best move is **DOWN** to (8,5), which is safe and directly toward the closest apple at (8,1).\n\n**DOWN**",

There is no immediate threat, so we can prioritize moving toward apples.\n- The closest apples are at (7,2), (3,6), (4,5), (8,1), and (3,5). The most reachable in the near future are (7,2) and (3,6) or (3,5).\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (7,9) is a good choice because it allows us to move toward the apple at (7,2) in the next few turns (e.g., DOWN to (7,8), then DOWN to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), then DOWN to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2)).\n- Alternatively, moving **LEFT** to (5,9) could also be viable, but it would take longer to reach the apples on the left side (e.g., (3,6) or (3,5)).\n\n### Decision:\nMoving **RIGHT** to (7,9) is the best choice because it positions us to reach the apple at (7,2) in the next few turns while keeping options open. It also avoids the enemy's current position and doesn't trap us in a corner.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- Next few turns: Move toward (7,2) by going DOWN repeatedly.\n- Avoid the enemy's path (currently at (8,6), but we should monitor its movement).\n- If the enemy moves toward us, adjust to avoid collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

However, if the enemy moves DOWN to (7,7) and you move UP to (7,6), no immediate collision.\n- If you move UP to (7,6), the enemy could move DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT/RIGHT, but no immediate threat.\n- If you move RIGHT to (8,5), the enemy could move DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8), but no immediate threat.\n- If you move LEFT to (6,5), the enemy could move DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8), but no immediate threat.\n- If you move DOWN to (7,4), the enemy could move DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8), but no immediate threat.\n\n**Apple Reachability and Prioritization:**\n- The apple at (4,5) is directly LEFT of your head (move LEFT to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5)).\n- The apple at (7,2) is directly DOWN from your head (move DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2)).\n- The apple at (8,1) is diagonally down-right, but you cannot move diagonally. You would need to move RIGHT to (8,5), then DOWN to (8,4), then DOWN to (8,3), then DOWN to (8,2), then DOWN to (8,1).\n- The apple at (3,6) and (3,5) are farther away and less accessible.\n\n**Best immediate apple target:**\n- The apple at (4,5) is reachable in 3 moves (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT).\n- The apple at (7,2) is reachable in 3 moves (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN).\n- The apple at (8,1) is reachable in 5 moves, which is less efficient.\n\n**Future Moves and Strategy:**\n- Moving LEFT to (6,5) is safe and moves you closer to the apple at (4,5).\n- Moving DOWN to (7,4) is safe and moves you closer to the apple at (7,2).\n- Moving UP to (7,6) or RIGHT to (8,5) does not immediately bring you closer to any apple.\n\n**Enemy Movement Considerations:**\n- Enemy head is at (7,8). If you move LEFT to (6,5), the enemy could move DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8), but no immediate collision risk.\n- If you move DOWN to (7,4), the enemy could move DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8), but no immediate collision risk.\n- If you move UP to (7,6), the enemy could move DOWN to (7,7), which would not collide with you.\n- If you move RIGHT to (8,5), the enemy could move DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8), but no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- No immediate threats from the enemy.\n- Moving LEFT to (6,5) is the safest and most direct path to the apple at (4,5).\n- Moving DOWN to (7,4) is also safe and moves you closer to the apple at (7,2).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1. Collect the apple at (4,5) by moving LEFT to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5).\n2. After collecting the apple, explore toward the apple at (7,2) or (8,1) depending on enemy movements.\n3. Avoid getting trapped in the top-left corner; try to spread out to avoid collisions.\n4. Keep an eye on the enemy's head position to avoid potential future collisions.\n\n### **Final Decision:**\nThe best move is **LEFT** to (6,5), which is safe and directly toward the closest apple at (4,5).\n\n**LEFT**",

Possible moves for the enemy:\n  - UP: (7, 4)\n  - DOWN: (7, 2) - This would collide with an apple at (7, 2).\n  - LEFT: (6, 3)\n  - RIGHT: (8, 3) - This would collide with an apple at (8, 3).\n\nIf you move **DOWN to (3, 5)**, the enemy could move UP to (7, 4), which is not a collision with you.\nIf you move **LEFT to (2, 6)**, the enemy could move LEFT to (6, 3), which is not a collision with you.\nIf you move **RIGHT to (4, 6)**, the enemy could move RIGHT to (8, 3), which is not a collision with you.\n\n#### **Risk Assessment:**\n- Moving **DOWN to (3, 5)** is safe and allows you to potentially reach the apple at (8, 5) or (5, 0) more efficiently.\n- Moving **LEFT to (2, 6)** or **RIGHT to (4, 6)** are also safe but do not immediately help in reaching any apple.\n\n#### **Long-Term Plan:**\n1. Move **DOWN to (3, 5)** to avoid getting stuck in a corner and to keep options open.\n2. Explore toward the apple at (8, 5) or (5, 0) in the next few turns.\n3. Avoid getting trapped by spreading out and keeping multiple safe directions available.\n4. Keep an eye on the enemy's head position to avoid potential future collisions.\n\n### **Final Decision:**\nThe best move is **DOWN** to (3, 5), which keeps you flexible and avoids getting cornered.\n\n**DOWN**",

Moving **DOWN** will allow us to collect it immediately.\n- After collecting the apple at **(7, 2)**, we will have a body segment at **(7, 3)**. This will give us more flexibility and protection.\n- The enemy is currently at **(3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)**, which is not directly blocking our path or moving toward us. However, we must continue to monitor its movement.\n- After securing the apple at **(7, 2)**, consider the apple at **(8, 1)** or **(8, 5)** for future moves.\n- Avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends. Keep exploring other apples if the path becomes risky.\n\n### Decision:\nMoving **DOWN** to **(7, 2)** is the best choice because it allows us to collect the apple immediately, increasing our score and body length, while avoiding immediate threats.\n\nDOWN",
