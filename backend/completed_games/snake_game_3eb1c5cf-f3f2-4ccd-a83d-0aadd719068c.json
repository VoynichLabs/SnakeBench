This is still the optimal choice because:\n1. It's the closest apple to my current position (4 moves away)\n2. No collision risk with the enemy who is now at (9, 9)\n3. Continuing straight UP is the most efficient path\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP toward (8, 6). After collecting this apple, I should reassess the board and potentially target either (2, 2) or another apple depending on where the enemy snake moves.\n\nUP"
