DOWN is legal.\n\n**Where are the apples and what’s the path?**\n- (0,2): On the same column, just need to keep moving DOWN. Needs four more moves: (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), then (0,2).\n- (1,4): Slightly right and lower. Would require shifting right and then down.\n- (0,0): In the same column as me, even further down below (0,2).\n\n**Should I keep moving DOWN?**\n- Yes: It’s the shortest, safest, most uncontested way to keep gaining apples and getting longer, without risking collision.\n- The only way I might get blocked is if I box myself into the bottom left by not planning my turn after going down — but as of now, my body is strung out upward to the right, so I’ll have many tail pieces to vacate my path as I descend.\n\n**Should I instead go RIGHT to open options?**\n- Going RIGHT to (1,7) means giving up on the immediate (0,2) apple. This would only be justified if there was a threat, or if my own body risked boxing me in the left column, but that isn’t the case.\n- My own body pieces are currently all at (0,8), (0,9), and then further right and up, so as I descend, my tail segments just keep moving up/right with me, slowly opening more space below.\n- No enemy risk from (1,7) right now, but there’s also no apple — going RIGHT is less efficient.\n\n**Risks if I keep moving DOWN?**\n- Almost none. The only thing to watch is not to get trapped against the left wall or my own tail as I loop back up. But with apples at (0,2) and (0,0), I have clear objectives to eat before I’d have to turn out.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKeep moving DOWN — it’s the fastest way to clean up apples on my exclusive side, with no collision risk and a clear, productive path. There is no need to divert right yet, as the left wall is uncontested. I should plan to eat (0,2) and then (0,0), then assess whether to loop up or shift right toward (1,4).\n\n**Next-turn strategy reminder:**  \nAfter getting low on the left side (after eating apples at (0,2) and (0,0)), be careful not to box myself in at (0,0). Move RIGHT before I run out of space, or plan to snake up the left edge if my tail will have cleared.\n\n---\n\n**Decided move: DOWN**",
