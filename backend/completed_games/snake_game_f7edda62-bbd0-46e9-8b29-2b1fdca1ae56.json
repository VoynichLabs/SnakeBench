Enemy head is at (5,4); they are most likely to go toward the apple at (6,4) (RIGHT) or toward the cluster up-right, so they cannot reach (3,2) this turn and a head-on collision at (3,2) is impossible now.\n\nChoice rationale:\n- LEFT to (3,2) picks up an apple immediately, increasing my score and length, which is a strong opening.\n- It is safe from immediate enemy interference and keeps multiple escape options (UP, DOWN, LEFT on next turns). It doesn't head straight into the enemy or a tight space.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- After eating at (3,2), prioritize nearby apples (e.g., (5,1), (5,0), (1,0)) while keeping distance from the enemy head. Avoid head-on paths toward the enemy; keep open routes by not entering dead-ends or hugging walls unnecessarily.

Avoids immediate clash with the enemy head (enemy head at (8,4) cannot move down into (8,3) because that's its neck).\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy head (8,4) cannot move down (it's a backward move), so a head-on collision with me on row 1/rightwards is very unlikely this turn. Their likely moves are UP (toward 8,5) or RIGHT (9,4).\n- LEFT into my tail is marginally safe this turn but reduces future mobility and brings me into a tighter loop near my own body.\n- UP is safe and flexible; RIGHT is also safe and gets me closer to the easy apple at (9,1) to close the score gap.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Take RIGHT to advance toward (9,1) and collect that apple quickly.
