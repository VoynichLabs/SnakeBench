We're LIVE on turn 0 and this is our moment to establish dominance! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's break down this 10x10 arena:\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- My snake (ID 0): Head at (9,7), body: none, apples: 0 \ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy snake (ID 1): Head at (6,3), body: none, apples: 0 \ud83d\udc0d\n- **KEY FACT:** We're both starting with NO bodies! This is a pure head-to-head battle from the jump! No tails to worry about yet, but that also means we're both vulnerable to immediate collisions.\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY:**\nLook at these apples scattered around! There's a cluster at (8,8), (9,8), (9,9) in the top-right corner near me. But honestly? F*ck the apples right now. We're not here to snack, we're here to CRUSH our enemy!\n\n**THE REAL TALK:**\n- Enemy is at (6,3) - that's bottom-middle area\n- I'm at (9,7) - top-right corner\n- Distance between us: We're about 4-5 moves apart\n- **CRITICAL:** Since we both have NO bodies, if we charge directly at each other and collide head-on, it's a DOUBLE DEATH! Both snakes die instantly!\n\n**MY GAME PLAN:**\nI need to force a situation where:\n1. The enemy is forced into a tight spot\n2. I have higher score (apples) for potential head-on collision\n3. I can trap them against walls or my own body\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVE DECISION:**\nLooking at my options from (9,7):\n- **UP to (9,8)**: Moves me closer to the apple cluster at (9,8), (9,9), (8,8). But (9,8) has an apple! This grows me, giving me the score advantage. Also keeps me near the corner wall for potential body blocking later.\n- **DOWN to (9,6)**: Safe, but moves away from high-value apple zone\n- **LEFT to (8,7)**: Safe, middle ground, but no immediate apple\n- **RIGHT to (10,7)**: OFF BOARD! DEATH! \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nI need to establish board control. Since I'm starting at (9,7) and there's an apple at (9,8) RIGHT ABOVE ME, I should grab that immediately. This gives me:\n- +1 score advantage\n- +1 body segment (gives me something to use for blocking later)\n- Positioning near the top-right corner for potential trap setups\n\nMy plan: \n1. Turn 0: UP to (9,8) - Eat apple, grow, establish early lead\n2. Turn 1+: Use my body growth to start walling off the top-right corner while forcing the enemy into tight spaces\n3. Monitor enemy's movement - if they come toward me, use my growing body to create barriers\n4. Once I have score advantage (2+ apples), I can force head-on collisions with confidence\n\n**LET'S DO THIS CHAT!** Going UP to grab that apple and start building our empire! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

Opponent head: (9,7). No bodies on either side \u2014 clean slate.\n- Nearby apple we can reach in 2 moves: (6,5). Opponent is up-right near (9,7) and likely going for the cluster around (9,8)/(9,9)/(8,8).\n\nDecision thinking (fans, I\u2019ll talk you through it):\n1) Consider all four moves from (6,3):\n   - UP -> (6,4)\n   - DOWN -> (6,2)\n   - LEFT -> (5,3)\n   - RIGHT -> (7,3)\n2) Eliminate immediate deaths: none of these moves are off-board, into bodies, or backwards into our own body (we have no tail). All four are safe now.\n3) Head-on collision risk: opponent is far at (9,7); they cannot reach any of our candidate cells this turn, so no instant head-on danger.\n4) Strategic evaluation:\n   - UP (6,4) puts us one step closer to the apple at (6,5) and preserves maximum mobility (we still have 4 options next turn).\n   - LEFT or RIGHT could be fine, but they don\u2019t pursue the nearest apple and could limit options if we drift horizontally.\n   - DOWN is passive and moves away from immediate content and control.\n5) Aggro check: we want to grow to dominate and force collisions later. Grabbing (6,5) soon is priority to start that snowball.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move UP now to (6,4).\n- Next turn go UP again to grab (6,5) apple and grow \u2014 get the scoring edge.\n- After growing, pivot to control the center column and press right/up to hem the enemy toward the top-right corner where their escape options drop. Force them into risky head-on or wall traps once we have length advantage.\n\nFinal move \u2014 keep options open, get to the apple, and start the slow box-in.

My body forms a wall from (9,9) to (9,7). The enemy is at (6,5), heading... we don't know his move yet.\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY:**\nApples are everywhere (15 of them!), but I'm not chasing them. I'm CHASING MY ENEMY! With a 2-1 score lead, if we collide head-on, I WIN. I need to force him into a trap or force a collision where I survive.\n\n**MY CURRENT POSITION ANALYSIS:**\nI'm at (9,9) \u2014 the top-right corner. My tail is at (9,7). If I move, my tail will move (unless I eat an apple).\n- **UP (9,10):** OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN (9,8):** That's my own body! DEAD! \u274c\n- **LEFT (8,9):** Is that safe? Let's check... There's an apple at (8,8) but that's behind me. Wait, looking at the board:\n  - (8,9) is currently empty on the board state!\n  - (8,8) has an apple, but that's not where I'm moving.\n  - My body is at (9,8) and (9,7), so (8,9) doesn't hit my body.\n- **RIGHT (10,9):** OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:**\nFrom the corner at (9,9), I'm actually TRAPPED! My only safe move is LEFT to (8,9). If I don't move LEFT, I'm dead next turn because my own body blocks everything else.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (8,9) to escape the corner. From there, I'll have more maneuverability. I want to position myself to cut off the enemy's access to apples and force him into a narrow corridor where I can corner him. With my length advantage (3 vs 2 after this move), I can start boxing him in.\n\n**DECISION:** GOING LEFT! Survival first, domination next!\n\nLEFT",

Not great.\n- DOWN (7,3): safe and flexible (3 exits) but doesn\u2019t score \u2014 slower comeback while they\u2019re +1 apple.\n- RIGHT (8,4): lands on an apple (ties the score 3\u20133), grows us, and preserves 3 good follow-up moves (DOWN, UP, or RIGHT to another apple at 9,4). Best mix of aggression and mobility.\n\nPlan (short-term):\n1) Grab the apple at (8,4) now to tie the score and gain length \u2014 we need parity before we box them. \ud83c\udf4f\n2) Use the extra segment to push upward/right toward the top-right apple cluster, then start compressing their escape lanes once we have length advantage.\n3) Avoid head-on while they\u2019re still ahead; only force collision when we\u2019re longer or equal and can win the trade.\n\nWe\u2019re going to snatch that apple and start chipping into their corner.

Just ate that apple at (7, 8) last turn! Length 5, Score 4! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Enemy snake (ID 1):** Head at (8, 4), Body: [(7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5)]. Length 4, Score 3.\n- **Apple gone:** (7, 8) is now part of my body. No apple there anymore.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS FROM (7, 8):**\n- **UP (7, 9):** Is it on board? Yes. Empty? Board shows '.' at (7, 9). Safe! \u2705\n- **DOWN (7, 7):** On board. Empty? '.' Yes. Safe! \u2705\n- **LEFT (6, 8):** On board. Empty? '.' Yes. Safe! \u2705\n- **RIGHT (8, 8):** MY BODY! (8, 8) is my second segment. CRASH! \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY RATIONALE:**\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Which is best for boxing in Snake #1?\n\n- **UP (7, 9):** Moves me to the top edge. From there, I'd have access to apples at (9, 9) (but that's my tail segment when I move? Wait, (9, 9) is currently my tail, but after I move, my tail will shift... Actually, (9, 9) is the last segment, so if I don't eat, my tail will move to (9, 8). So (9, 9) might become free? Let's check the board: (9, 9) is 'T' - my tail. If I move UP, my tail will leave (9, 9) empty. But I'm not heading there. I'm at (7, 9). This position is safe but doesn't get me closer to Snake #1, who is at (8, 4) - that's down and right from me.\n\n- **DOWN (7, 7):** Moves me toward Snake #1! He's at (8, 4), so (7, 7) is getting closer. From (7, 7), I could potentially cut off his escape routes. There's an apple at (5, 7) to the left. This seems like aggressive positioning.\n\n- **LEFT (6, 8):** Moves me left, still in the upper middle. From here, I can see apples at (5, 7) and (4, 3) in future turns. But it's moving me away from Snake #1 (who is at x=8).\n\n**DECISION:** GOING DOWN to (7, 7)! Why?\n1. **AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING:** Snake #1 is at (8, 4) - I'm at (7, 8). By going DOWN, I'm moving directly toward his general area. He's in the bottom-right quadrant, and I'm moving to intercept.\n2. **BOXING IN POTENTIAL:** From (7, 7), I can start to create barriers. My body will form a line from (8, 8) down to (7, 8) to (7, 7). That's a nice L-shape that can cut off his access to the top-right.\n3. **KEEPING OPTIONS OPEN:** From (7, 7), I'll have 3 safe moves next turn (UP to (7,8) is my body, so maybe 2? Let's check: (7,8) is body, (6,7) empty, (8,7) empty, (7,6) empty). Actually from (7,7), I'd have UP (7,8) - body, LEFT (6,7) - empty, RIGHT (8,7) - empty, DOWN (7,6) - empty. So 3 safe moves! Good options.\n4. **SCORE GAP:** I'm up 4-3. I want to maintain pressure. If I can trap him while staying safe, I win.\n5. **APPLE ACCESS:** There's an apple at (5, 7) which is 2 left from (7, 7). I can go for it soon if it makes sense.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (7, 7), next turn I'll try to move toward (6, 7) or (7, 6) depending on where Snake #1 goes. I need to watch his move this turn. If he moves toward me (like to (8,5) or (7,4) which is already his body), I need to avoid head-on. My length gives me board control. Let's force him into a corner!\n\nDOWN",

From here, I could chase apples at (5, 7) and (4, 3), but I'm moving AWAY from Snake #1 who is at (9, 4) - that's up and right. He's in the top-right corner, I'm heading to the bottom. This gives him space to dominate the top-right.\n\n- **LEFT (6, 7):** Moves me left, staying in the middle. From (6, 7), I have access to apples at (5, 7) and (4, 3). This keeps me centered but doesn't directly pressure Snake #1.\n\n- **RIGHT (8, 7):** **CRITICAL MOVE!** This puts my head RIGHT next to his territory! Snake #1 is at (9, 4) - just 3 cells away vertically. From (8, 7), I'm boxing in his top-right corner. My body will form a wall: (7, 7) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9). That's a fortress cutting off the top-right quadrant!\n\n**DECISION:** GOING RIGHT to (8, 7)! Why?\n1. **MAXIMUM PRESSURE:** Snake #1 is at (9, 4). From (8, 7), I'm literally one cell away from his column and three from his row. If he tries to move up or right, he hits walls or my body!\n2. **BOXING HIM IN:** My body creates a barrier along y=7-9 and x=8-9. He's trapped in the corner with only limited escape routes (left to x=8 or down to y=3). \n3. **HEAD-ON COLLISION SETUP:** I'm at 4 apples, he's at 4 apples. If he tries to challenge me by moving toward (8, 5) or (8, 6), we could collide. Since scores are tied, I want to avoid immediate head-on, but I'm positioning to win future collisions if I grow.\n4. **APPLE ACCESS:** From (8, 7), I can still pivot to (7, 7) next turn (if safe) or (8, 6) to chase apples. The apple at (5, 9) is accessible via (8,8)->(8,9)->... but wait, (8,8) is my body. Actually I need to think through pathing.\n5. **BOARD CONTROL:** The top-right is the most valuable real estate. By occupying it, I force Snake #1 into the bottom-left where apples are scarce.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After moving RIGHT to (8, 7), watch Snake #1's move. If he goes LEFT to (8, 4), I'll know he's playing defensive. If he goes UP or RIGHT, he's challenging. Next turn, I'll likely move DOWN to (8, 6) to solidify the barrier and chase that apple at (5, 7). Keep the pressure on! Don't let him breathe!\n\nRIGHT\n**END RATIONALE**",

Length 5, Score 4.\n- **Enemy snake (ID 1):** Head at (9, 5), Body: [(9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)]. Length 5, Score 4.\n- **Apple situation:** All apples remain. Enemy moved UP from (9,4) to (9,5) - that's straight up into the gap I left. He's getting bold!\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS FROM (8, 7):**\n- **UP (8, 8):** MY BODY! CRASH! \u274c\n- **DOWN (8, 6):** On board. Board shows '.' at (8, 6). Safe! \u2705\n- **LEFT (7, 7):** On board. BUT THAT'S MY BODY! CRASH! \u274c (My head was here last turn, body segment)\n- **RIGHT (9, 7):** On board. Board shows '.' at (9, 7). Safe! \u2705\n\n**STRATEGY RATIONALE:**\nTwo safe moves: DOWN to (8, 6) or RIGHT to (9, 7). Let's break it down:\n\n- **RIGHT (9, 7):** This puts me directly next to Snake #1 at (9, 5)! We'd be two cells apart vertically. From (9, 7), I'm boxing him in the top-right corner even harder - he's at (9,5), I'm at (9,7), with my body forming a wall at (8,7), (7,7), (8,8), (8,9). He'd be trapped in columns 8-9 rows 4-5 with limited escape. BUT... if he moves UP to (9,6) and I move RIGHT to (9,7), we'd be adjacent heads. Next turn if he challenges and I grow, I could win a collision. However, (9,7) is also an apple location! The apple list shows (9,6) and (9,2) as apples. Wait, (9,7) isn't listed as an apple drop. Let me check... Actually, (9,6) is an apple, (9,7) is empty. So no growth there.\n\n- **DOWN (8, 6):** This moves me toward the apple at (5,7). From (8,6), I maintain my barrier formation and keep options open. I can pivot left to (7,6), down to (8,5), or right to (9,6). (9,6) has an apple! So if I go DOWN now, next turn I could go RIGHT to (9,6) and eat that apple, growing to 5 apples while boxing him in from below. That's a brilliant setup!\n\n**THE PLAY:** GOING DOWN to (8, 6)!\nWhy? Because:\n1. **APPLE ACCESS:** (8,6) positions me perfectly to eat the apple at (9,6) next turn by going RIGHT.\n2. **BOXING IN PROGRESS:** My body continues forming the barrier along y=7-9, x=8-9. Snake #1 is still trapped at (9,5) with his body at (9,4), (8,4), etc.\n3. **SAFETY:** Moving to (8,6) keeps me away from immediate head-on collision while maintaining pressure.\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) for the apple, DOWN to (8,5) to cut off more space, or LEFT to (7,6) to maintain center control.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Next turn, if Snake #1 moves UP to (9,6) (challenging the apple), I'll be forced to avoid collision. But if he stays or moves left, I'll go RIGHT to (9,6), eat the apple, and grow to 5! Then I'll have 5 apples vs his 4, and I can start aggressively hunting him down. The top-right corner is MINE!\n\nDOWN",

Dead. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (8,5): legal but drifts away from the apple and reduces immediate pressure. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- UP -> (9,6): legal, contains an apple (9,6). Eating it gives us a 5\u20134 lead and lets us force more favorable trades. \u2705\n\nThreat read:\n- Opponent head at (8,7). Their immediate moves: (9,7), (8,6) \u2014 they cannot reach (9,6) this turn, so no head-on risk if we go UP now.\n- Their body cluster is around x7\u20138, y7\u20139; grabbing the top-right apple tightens our control and lets us compress their space next turns.\n\nTactical call:\n- Take UP to eat (9,6) now. Leading 5\u20134 gives us the leverage to force a head-on later if they blunder into our body. We keep options after the apple (LEFT or UP if available) to start hemming them into x7\u20139, y7\u20139 while avoiding suicidal collisions.\n\nShort plan for the next few turns (for our next-rationale clip):\n- Eat (9,6) this turn to go up 5\u20134.\n- Pivot to pressure left/up to reduce their free space around x7\u20139,y7\u20139.\n- Only commit to head-on trades once we have the apple advantage and escape routes secured.\n\nUP",

Let's analyze:\n\n- **DOWN (8, 5):** Moves me toward the lower middle section. From (8,5), I have options: DOWN to (8,4) - but check the board... (8,4) is part of HIS BODY (his body list shows (8,4)). That would be suicide! So from (8,5), I'd have LEFT to (7,5) - but (7,5) is also HIS BODY! The only safe escape from (8,5) would be back UP to (8,6) or RIGHT to (9,5) - but (9,5) is his body too! DOWN into (8,5) is a TRAP! \ud83d\udea8\n\n- **LEFT (7, 6):** This moves me AWAY from the enemy and gives me breathing room! From (7,6), I can go DOWN to (7,5) - wait, (7,5) is his body! LEFT to (6,6) - safe! UP to (7,7) - MY BODY! DOWN to (7,5) - ENEMY BODY! RIGHT back to (8,6) - safe! So I have at least 2 escape routes: LEFT to (6,6) or RIGHT to (8,6). That's survivable!\n\n**THE PLAY:** GOING LEFT to (7,6)!\nWhy?\n1. **AVOID THE TRAP:** (8,5) is surrounded by enemy and my own body - it's a death box! (7,6) gives me freedom!\n2. **MAINTAIN DISTANCE:** The enemy is at (9,6). Moving LEFT puts space between us - smart defensive positioning while we figure out our next attack.\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (7,6), I can pivot toward the apple at (8,2) or the cluster in the center. I'm NOT cornered!\n4. **SURVIVAL FIRST:** Can't win if I'm dead! He's got 5 apples now, so I need to stay alive and find my growth opportunity.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Next turn, I'll evaluate where Snake #1 moves. If he moves toward the center, I can hunt. If he stays top-right, I'll move LEFT toward (6,6) or DOWN toward (7,5) if it clears (since he might move away). The apple at (8,2) is looking juicy from this position.

They CANNOT go UP (that\u2019s their neck/backwards). Their legal replies are LEFT (7,6), DOWN (8,5) or RIGHT (9,6).\n- If we go LEFT into (8,6) and they go RIGHT into (9,6), we swap into each other\u2019s head cells \u2014 that usually results in both heads moving into the other's body segment and a mutual KO.

High upside (force head-on win or cut them off next turns). Low downside if they dodge \u2014 we still get closer and have multiple follow-ups.\n\nPlan for next few turns (for the next clip):\n- If they take the bait and force a head-on -> mutual death likely -> we WIN on apples. \ud83c\udfc6\n- If they dodge, follow-up: continue LEFT to (7,6) to compress their space, then pivot UP to trap them in the 7\u20138\u20139 zone. Keep forcing risky swaps when apples edge is in our favor.\n- Always avoid moving off-board or into our neck.
