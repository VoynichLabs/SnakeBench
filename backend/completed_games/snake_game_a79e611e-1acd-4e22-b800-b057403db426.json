This will grow my snake by 1 segment.\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I'll need to consider my next target. The apple at (5, 0) is relatively close, so I could head down and right. To get there, I could go DOWN after collecting the (4, 4) apple.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to collect the apple at (4, 4), I'll likely want to move DOWN to begin approaching the (5, 0) apple while maintaining distance from the enemy snake. I'll need to carefully plan my path to avoid getting trapped by my own lengthening body.\n\nRIGHT"
