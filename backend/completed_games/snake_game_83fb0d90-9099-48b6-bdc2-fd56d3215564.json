APPLE DROPS ALL OVER THE MAP, BUT WE FOCUS ON THE PRIZE: SLASH HIS SPACE, EAT THAT APPLE, DOMINATE THE CENTER, AND FORCE A HEAD-ON IF WE CAN OUTSCORE HIM. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):\n- 1) Consider ALL four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- 2) ELIMINATE unsafe moves: off-board, into your own body (you have no body yet, so safe), or into the enemy body this turn. No self-harm and no walking into a wall.\n- 3) Among SAFE moves, pick ones that keep multiple follow-up options alive AND move toward reachable apples while minimizing chances of an early trap.\n- 4) Since the enemy is far (7,3) and there\u2019s an apple at (3,5) right next to our potential next cell, prioritize moves that grab that apple and close the gap without inviting a head-on disaster.\n\nEVALUATION OF SAFE MOVES FROM (2,5):\n- UP -> (2,6): safe, but distance to enemy remains modest; misses nearby apple now.\n- DOWN -> (2,4): safe; leaves us near the central corridor, but not taking an immediate apple.\n- LEFT -> (1,5): safe; keeps us toward center but not an apple.\n- RIGHT -> (3,5): safe and immediately eats the apple located at (3,5); also places us one step closer to the opponent and marks a strong tempo to pressure him.\n\nCHOSEN MOVE (FOR REAL): RIGHT\n- Why RIGHT? It immediately rewards with an apple at (3,5), grows our length, and reduces the distance to the opponent in a way that we can threaten future containment while staying safe. With no body yet, the risk is minimal, and we gain tempo to set up a squeeze later.\n\nPLAN (short-term and to-your-future-self):\n- Short-term: move RIGHT to eat the apple at (3,5), growing to 1 segment, and push ourselves into a more central/advanced position to control space.\n- Mid-term: start steering toward the center while watching for opportunities to cut off the opponent\u2019s routes, aiming for a box-in approach along the grid\u2019s middle lanes and edges.\n- Long-term: create a mild trap by guiding along a wall-leaning path to shrink his available safe moves, forcing potential head-on or dead-end scenarios where our higher tempo and space control give us the win.\n- Key reminders: keep eyes on opponent\u2019s potential head movements; if he ever lines up a direct collision and you have the option, consider sacrificing a route to ensure a safer exchange that leaves you with the apples advantage.\n\nREADY FOR THE NEXT TULIPS OF BATTLE. AGAIN, MAKE IT HAPPEN: RIGHT",

It lets us eat the apple at (3,6) immediately, grows our length, and puts us on a stronger central path to pressure the opponent later.\n\nREASONING: Immediate growth keeps us ahead on apples and increases our options for trapping space in the center. It also reduces the risk of getting boxed in early since the apple at (3,6) is right in our vicinity. The opponent is far (7,2), so we have breathing room to advance without rushing into a reckless chase.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: Move UP to (3,6), eat the apple, become length 2, and steer toward the center to start sealing off lanes.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Build a controlled wedge in the middle\u2014pressing toward (4,6)/(4,5) area, watch for opportunities to cut off his routes, and aim for a favorable head-on if we gain more apples.\n\nready to box this guy and dominate the board. \nup",

We can afford to play the longer game\u2014create walls, force misinputs, and spring a heads-up collision only if the math is right (clean head-on when we\u2019re way ahead or the clash helps us close the gap). \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5\n\nShort-term plan: push along the top-right corridor, police any sneak from the bottom, and look for openings to swing toward the enemy if he dares climb. Long-term: widen our control, avoid self-traps, and trigger a boxed-in finish if the opportunity presents itself without risking survival.\n\nMove coming now: \nright",

Aggressive mindset, and we\u2019re currently up 8 apples to 7, so pressure is on to convert the lead.\n\nMove options this turn:\n- UP: (9,9) \u2014 collision with our own body (blocked).\n- RIGHT: (10,8) \u2014 off the board (dead).\n- LEFT: (8,8) \u2014 safe for now, keeps options open but starts drifting toward the interior.\n- DOWN: (9,7) \u2014 safe, keeps us hugging the east edge and preserves tight future corridors.\n\nWhy DOWN? It keeps us pressed along the east wall, limiting how easily he can slip into open space or collide with us from different angles, and it sets up a tighter funnel later on. By staying along the edge, we maintain control over his escape routes and increase the chance of a future head-on or trap as our paths converge.\n\nLong-term plan notes:\n- Use the outer boundary and our current top-right arc to shrink his maneuvering room. If he commits to the center lanes, mirror him with tighter turns to cut off options and force mismatches.\n- Maintain the lead by staying aggressive but not reckless; the goal is to turn space control into a decisive collision or trap while avoiding self-drops into corners.\n- Watch for opportunities where he must choose between two adjacent lanes; orient our body to block one option and push him toward a collision or a forced alley.\n\nPlan: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Not happening.\n- UP -> would push into (6,9), which is currently your tail. In this sim, moving into your own body = dead, so unsafe.\n- RIGHT -> safe, but you\u2019ll start threading along the top-right tunnel and could eventually trap yourself against your own body if you loop too tight.\n- LEFT -> safe, keeps you on the outer lane and gives space to swing around toward interesting apples (and keeps future routes open).\n\nSafe moves: LEFT or RIGHT. Given the board and the goal to keep space and threaten the apple cluster, LEFT is the smarter pick here. It lines you up to chase the apple at (3,8) in a couple turns and preserves flexibility to pivot downward later if the opponent presses.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (5,8) now.\n- From there, trend LEFT to (4,8) and then to (3,8) to grab the apple there.\n- While doing this, maintain the top corridor to avoid getting boxed in by your own body, and keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s bottom-left path. If he starts forcing you toward a trap, rotate back toward the center or top edge to buy space.\n- Try to force a safe head-on only if you gain a clear apples advantage or can steer him into a dead end, otherwise prioritize survival and space.\n\nLong-term strategy note for the next turns:\n- Your current apple count is 9 vs opponent\u2019s 10. The plan is to steadily accrue apples by taking reachable, low-risk apples along the top while preventing a late-game squeeze from the rival. Maintain the high-ground advantage to influence his options, and avoid isolating yourself in a corner where a single misstep ends the run.\n\nLEFT",

This keeps you in the fight with a longer body and lays groundwork to pressure the opponent from above without immediate risk of a head-on collision.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- After landing (3,9), stay flexible: push to (2,9) or (4,9) next turn to threaten the left/top flank and steer the enemy toward the wall and your long line.\n- Watch for head-on chances; you currently trail by 1 apple, so avoid a reckless head-on unless you can force it with a net gain.\n- Maintain multiple safe escape routes (the top edge gives you options to swing around and box him in). If he tries to dive into the top area, mirror him to keep him boxed toward the wall.\n\nRISK CHECK:\n- No immediate collision risk this turn.\n- Opponent can\u2019t reach (3,9) this turn, so you won\u2019t collide this move.\n- Your path avoids backing into your own body and stays within the 10x10 grid.\n\nUP",

I already have a clear vertical tunnel at column\u202f0 (only my own tail at (0,\u202f4) and (0,\u202f3) sitting below, which will clear as I move).\n\n**Safety Check**\n\n| Direction | Target cell | Occupied? | Outcome |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------|\n| **UP**    | (1,\u202f10)     | Off\u2011board | \u274c Illegal |\n| **DOWN**  | (1,\u202f8)      | My own neck | \u274c Illegal |\n| **LEFT**  | (0,\u202f9)      | Empty, no apple | \u2705 Safe, opens a path down the wall |\n| **RIGHT** | (2,\u202f9)      | Opponent head (will vacate) \u2013 but future turns become cramped and risk head\u2011to\u2011head swaps | \u26a0\ufe0f Risky |\n\n**Why LEFT wins**\n\n- **Immediate safety** \u2013 no collision with any snake body.  \n- **Future freedom** \u2013 from (0,\u202f9) I can march straight down the empty column\u202f0, snag the apple line at (0,\u202f1) and keep a wide corridor for maneuvering.  \n- **Aggressive positioning** \u2013 while I head to the wall, the opponent is forced either left into my just\u2011vacated spot (still safe) or down into the centre where I can later cut off his routes.  \n\n**Short\u2011term game plan**\n\n1. Move LEFT to (0,\u202f9).  \n2. Then head **DOWN** each turn, clearing the column and eating the apple at (0,\u202f1).  \n3. Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s move; if he tries to cut me off, I\u2019ll use the extra length I gain from apples to block him and force a head\u2011on when I have the score advantage.\n\nLet\u2019s lock it in!  \n\nLEFT",

This keeps you central and starts lining up with the apple cluster on row 6 (4,6) and (5,6).\n- Opponent on turn 26 will likely drop to (0,7) as their only safe option; this keeps them on the left edge and away from the row-6 apples for now.\n- Turn 27: From (2,6), options are DOWN to (2,5) or RIGHT to (3,6). I\u2019ll tilt toward RIGHT to slide toward (3,6) and then (4,6) to snag the apple at (4,6) on Turn 28 if possible.\n- Turn 28+: After grabbing (4,6), we\u2019ll reassess. The goal is to keep multiple safe follow-ups (not trap ourselves) while inching toward additional apples on row 6 (and the general center) to close the apple gap with the opponent.\n- Long-term strategy: build a flexible, open cross-like path that punishes the opponent if they try to skirt around your line, while prioritizing safe apple growth to swing the score in your favor without risking a dead-end or a head-on stalemate.\n\nDOWN",

Stay out of corners, maintain two or more safe continuations, and look for opportunities to create a mutual head-on if you have more apples.\n\nRIGHT",
