It can move UP (9,4), DOWN (9,2), LEFT (8,3), RIGHT (off board \u2192 invalid).  \nWe are far apart, so no possible head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nClosest apples to me (5,7):  \n- (8,5) is 3 units away in Manhattan distance: \u0394x=3, \u0394y=2 \u2192 total 5.  \n- (8,3) is \u0394x=3, \u0394y=4 \u2192 total 7.  \n- (3,2) is \u0394x=2, \u0394y=5 \u2192 total 7.  \n- (8,1) is \u0394x=3, \u0394y=6 \u2192 total 9.  \n- (0,0) is far.  \n\n(8,5) is closest. To get closer to (8,5):  \nFrom (5,7), need to go right (increase x) and down (decrease y).  \n\nSo **RIGHT** or **DOWN** moves me closer in Manhattan distance.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each move:**  \n\nCheck each:  \n- **UP** (5,8): then possible moves: UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8), RIGHT (6,8) \u2013 all likely safe next turn unless enemy moves there.  \n- **DOWN** (5,6): then moves: UP (5,7), DOWN (5,5), LEFT (4,6), RIGHT (6,6) \u2013 all safe, and closer to (8,5).  \n- **LEFT** (4,7): then moves: UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7), RIGHT (5,7) \u2013 safe but away from closest apple.  \n- **RIGHT** (6,7): then moves: UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7) \u2013 safe, closer to apple in x-direction.  \n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \nDOWN gets me closer in y to (8,5) (y=5 vs y=7), RIGHT gets me closer in x (x=6 vs x=5).  \nManhattan distance after:  \nDOWN to (8,5): \u0394x=3, \u0394y=1 \u2192 total 4.  \nRIGHT to (8,5): \u0394x=2, \u0394y=2 \u2192 total 4.  \n\nSame Manhattan distance after either move.  \n\nBut after RIGHT (6,7), I\u2019m closer to center and have more space toward apple at (8,5) with fewer turns needed. Also, from (6,7), I can go RIGHT again next turn to (7,7) then (8,7) then down to (8,5) in two more moves.  \n\nFrom (5,6) after DOWN: path to (8,5) could be RIGHT thrice then UP once, but that\u2019s longer. Actually: (5,6)\u2192(6,6)\u2192(7,6)\u2192(8,6)\u2192(8,5) is 4 moves. From (6,7): (6,7)\u2192(7,7)\u2192(8,7)\u2192(8,6)\u2192(8,5) is also 4 moves.  \n\nHmm, equal.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid future dead ends:**  \n\nAt length 1, no risk of trapping myself yet. But moving toward center keeps options open. RIGHT moves toward right side where apples are clustered (three apples at x=8).  \n\nAlso, enemy is at (9,3), so apples at (8,3) and (8,1) are closer to enemy. Apple at (8,5) is contested maybe, but I can reach it in same time as enemy? Enemy from (9,3) to (8,5): \u0394x=1, \u0394y=2 \u2192 3 moves. I\u2019m 4 moves away, so enemy could get there first if it moves toward it now. But enemy might go for (8,3) first.  \n\nStill, moving toward apple cluster is good.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nRIGHT gives better central position and heads toward apple-rich column x=8 while keeping all options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nContinue moving toward x=8 apples while checking enemy\u2019s position to avoid head-on collisions. If enemy moves toward (8,5), consider alternative apples like (3,2) to avoid conflict while short.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

That can\u2019t be right \u2014 looking at board display:  \n\nBoard shows at row 7: `. . . . . A 0 . . .`  \nSo (5,7) is an apple, (6,7) is my head. Yes, apple at (5,7) is one left of my head.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safety check from (6,7):**  \n\n- UP \u2192 (6,8): inside board, empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,6): inside board, empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,7): apple there, no snake body.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,7): inside board, empty.  \n\nAll four moves are safe from walls and collision with any snake body (enemy body at (9,3) and (8,3) is far).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Head-on collision risk with enemy:**  \n\nEnemy head at (8,3). Possible moves for enemy: UP (8,4), DOWN (8,2), LEFT (7,3), RIGHT (9,3) but (9,3) is its own body, so invalid.  \n\nFrom (6,7), my possible moves are far from (8,3) except if I go far down/left many steps. No possible same-cell collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n\nClosest apple is (5,7) \u2014 directly LEFT. Eating it would grow me to length 2 next turn (head moves to apple, tail stays? Actually, since I have no body yet, after eating apple my body will be [(5,7)] and head at new position? Wait, growth mechanics: when you eat an apple, you grow by 1 segment at the end of your body after moving. So if I move LEFT into (5,7) (apple), my new head is at (5,7), my body becomes [(6,7)] (the old head position). Yes.  \n\nSo eating apple now is good for score and growth.  \n\nOther apples: (8,5) is \u0394x=2, \u0394y=2 \u2192 4 Manhattan distance from (6,7).  \n(3,2) is \u0394x=3, \u0394y=5 \u2192 8.  \n(8,1) is \u0394x=2, \u0394y=6 \u2192 8.  \n(0,0) is far.  \n\nSo (5,7) is 1 step away, (8,5) is 4 steps away.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each move:**  \n\nIf I eat apple (LEFT): new head at (5,7), body at (6,7). Then next turn my possible moves from (5,7): UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7) but (6,7) is my body then, so RIGHT is invalid. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf I go UP (6,8): then next turn possible moves: UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8) \u2014 all 4 safe.  \n\nIf I go DOWN (6,6): then next turn: UP (6,7), DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6) \u2014 all 4 safe.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT (7,7): then next turn: UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7) \u2014 all 4 safe.  \n\nSo LEFT reduces future safe moves to 3 because of new body behind, but it gets me an apple immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of enemy contesting nearby apples:**  \n\nEnemy is at (8,3), length 2. It might go for (8,5) soon. If I eat (5,7) now, I\u2019ll be length 2 and can then maneuver toward (8,5) or (3,2).  \n\nEating early is generally good unless it traps you \u2014 but with length 2, no self-trapping yet.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nLEFT gets an apple now, increasing my score to 1 (tying enemy at 1 apple). It\u2019s safe, no immediate collision risk, and still leaves 3 possible moves next turn.  \n\nThe only downside is slightly reduced mobility next turn, but that\u2019s normal after eating.  \n\nGiven the objective is to collect apples safely, LEFT is the best.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (5,7), head at (5,7), body at (6,7). Avoid moving RIGHT into body next turn. Consider moving toward (8,5) via DOWN then RIGHT or toward (3,2) if enemy heads to (8,5). Keep away from enemy head path.  \n\nLEFT",

Enemy might not, but they are close and could. Safer to avoid that risk since I\u2019m shorter (length 2 vs 3) and losing head-on means I die and they might survive if they have longer body? Actually head-on kills both, but I have fewer apples (1 vs 2), so tie in apples \u2192 draw, but I want to win. Better to avoid symmetric death.  \nDOWN is safe, keeps mobility, and moves me toward center and toward backup apple (2,6).  \nRIGHT is riskier if enemy moves UP.  \nUP reduces mobility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter DOWN to (6,7), aim for (2,6) via (5,7),(4,7), etc., while watching enemy.

If I go RIGHT now to (7,7), I\u2019d be 2 steps away from (9,8) via (8,7),(9,7) or (8,8),(9,8), but enemy could reach (9,8) in 2 turns as well, risking head-on collision on turn 3 if we both aim for it.  \n(2,6) is safer \u2014 enemy far from it.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- DOWN to (6,6): next moves: UP (6,7) empty, DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6) \u2192 all 4 safe.  \n- LEFT to (5,7): next moves: UP (5,8) empty, DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7) empty \u2192 all 4 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (7,7): next moves: UP (7,8) empty, DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7) empty, RIGHT (8,7) \u2192 all 4 safe.  \n\nAll three keep full mobility.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nGoing RIGHT moves toward (9,8) but risks collision with enemy if they also go for it. Enemy might prioritize (9,8) because it\u2019s close.  \nGoing LEFT moves toward (2,6) and away from enemy, safer.  \nGoing DOWN moves toward center and keeps options open but doesn\u2019t progress much toward any apple.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is longer (length 3) and has more apples. Avoid direct confrontation. Target (2,6) or (3,2) while keeping space. From (6,7), LEFT to (5,7) is a step toward (2,6) and also opens path to (3,2) via down-left later.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT is safe, maintains mobility, moves toward a safer apple (2,6), and avoids enemy\u2019s likely path to (9,8).  \n\nLEFT",

That leaves me in corner but with room to go UP from (0,0) to (0,1) afterward.  \n\nActually, if I go DOWN now to (1,0), and enemy moves toward (8,4), no conflict.  \nIf I go LEFT now to (0,1), still safe.  \n\nBut going LEFT now means my head is at (0,1) \u2014 if enemy somehow rushed left (unlikely), but more importantly, from (0,1) my only safe moves next turn are UP (0,2) or DOWN (0,0) to eat apple. That\u2019s fine.  \n\nLet\u2019s simulate enemy likely move:  \nEnemy at (8,2) with apple at (8,4) two above. Enemy will likely go UP to (8,3) this turn to get closer to that apple. That\u2019s away from me.  \n\nSo both DOWN and LEFT are safe. I\u2019ll pick DOWN to (1,0) because it keeps my head one step from apple while staying off the left edge for now, giving slightly more perceived space.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN to (1,0) \u2192 next turn go LEFT to (0,0) to eat apple unless enemy interferes (they won\u2019t).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,0), if apple (0,0) still there, go LEFT to eat it. If enemy moves toward me (unlikely), be ready to go RIGHT to (2,0) to evade. After eating, grow to length 5, then plan route toward (0,8) or (3,8) apples while avoiding enemy.  \n\nDOWN",

But enemy is far right/top, moving toward (8,4) apple.  \nGoing RIGHT gives more space but delays eating.  \nHowever, eating apple now grows me to length 5, matching enemy length, and apple (0,0) is uncontested. Corner risk is manageable if I plan to exit upward next turn.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Plan for next turn if I eat apple:**  \nAfter eating, head at (0,0), only UP (0,1) safe. Next turn I must go UP to (0,1). From there, I can consider going to (0,2) or (1,1) depending on body position. My tail will be at (2,2) still, so (1,1) will be body next turn, so from (0,1) only UP (0,2) and RIGHT (1,1) (body) \u2014 actually only UP safe. That means two turns in a row I\u2019ll be forced upward along left edge. That\u2019s risky if enemy later comes left.  \n\nAlternative: go RIGHT now to (2,0), then maybe go UP to (2,1) next turn, aiming for (3,8) or (0,8) apples later while avoiding enemy. But leaving (0,0) apple uneaten lets enemy potentially get it later if they come left, but unlikely soon.  \n\nGiven enemy is far, eating apple now is safe short-term and grows me. Even if I\u2019m forced up left edge, I\u2019ll have more length to outlast enemy if they make a mistake.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT to (0,0) to eat apple and grow to length 5.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0,0), only UP to (0,1) is safe. Take it. Then from (0,1), likely only UP to (0,2) safe, so continue upward along left wall toward apple (0,8) while monitoring enemy movement.  \n\nLEFT",

But this will trap me along left edge for at least two more turns unless I eat an apple to grow and keep tail in place.  \nApple at (0,8) is far up; if I keep moving UP without eating, my tail shortens each turn, but I stay length 5 until I eat.  \nEnemy is far right; they may go for (7,5) or (6,3) apples.

From (0,2) only UP again until maybe (0,3) where RIGHT (1,3) might be free.  \nLong-term: aim for (0,8) apple while watching enemy. If enemy moves toward left side, I may need to change direction earlier by eating an apple to grow and keep tail behind me, opening more moves.  \nBut right now, no choice.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0,1), only UP safe again.

Possible enemy moves:  \nUP (7,5) apple, DOWN (7,3) empty, LEFT (6,4) empty, RIGHT (8,4) its body.  \nEnemy safe squares: (7,5), (7,3), (6,4).  \nMy only move is to (0,2). No overlap \u2192 no immediate head-on risk.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (0,8) at distance 6 upward. Moving UP continues toward it.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after UP:**  \nFrom (0,2) next turn:  \nUP (0,3) empty, DOWN (0,1) my body, LEFT off board, RIGHT (1,2) my body \u2192 only UP safe again.  \nThis confirms the trap along left wall. I must keep moving UP until either:  \n1) I eat the apple at (0,8) \u2014 that will grow me to length 6, and my tail won\u2019t move that turn, so from (0,8) after eating, DOWN (0,7) might be free (tail at (0,0) will move forward only if no apple eaten earlier). Actually, after eating, my body becomes: new head (0,8), then old head (0,7)? Wait, careful:  \nCurrent body: (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).  \nMove UP to (0,2): new body becomes (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) \u2014 tail (1,2) gone.  \nNext turn UP to (0,3): body becomes (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0) \u2014 tail (1,1) gone.  \nSo each step up shortens tail by 1, keeping length 5 until I eat an apple.  \nWhen I reach (0,8) and eat apple, length becomes 6, and tail stays at (1,0) that turn? Actually, eating means tail doesn\u2019t move, so body after eating at (0,8) would be: (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3) \u2014 wait, that\u2019s wrong because my current body isn\u2019t all vertical yet. Let\u2019s simulate:  \nStarting now: body: (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).  \nTurn 1 (now): UP to (0,2) \u2192 body: (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1).  \nTurn 2: UP to (0,3) \u2192 body: (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0).  \nTurn 3: UP to (0,4) \u2192 body: (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0).  \nTurn 4: UP to (0,5) \u2192 body: (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1).  \nTurn 5: UP to (0,6) \u2192 body: (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2).  \nTurn 6: UP to (0,7) \u2192 body: (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3).  \nTurn 7: UP to (0,8) apple \u2192 body: (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3) \u2014 length 6.  \nSo after eating at (0,8), my body is vertical along x=0 from y=3 to y=8. Then next turn from (0,8), DOWN (0,7) is body, LEFT off, RIGHT (1,8) empty, UP off. So only RIGHT would be safe \u2014 that frees me from left wall trap.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy might go for (7,5) apple or (6,3) apple. They are far away. My only path is UP until (0,8) apple. I must survive 7 turns moving only UP.  \nCheck if enemy could cut me off: unlikely given distance.  \nCheck if any apple appears closer to left column before (0,8) \u2014 currently none.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Plan for next few turns:**  \nKeep moving UP each turn until reaching (0,8) apple. After eating it, turn RIGHT to escape left edge and aim for other apples. Monitor enemy movement; if enemy moves toward left side before I reach apple, reassess, but currently no choice.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0,2), only UP safe again. Take it. Continue upward along left wall toward (0,8) apple. After eating apple, plan to turn RIGHT to escape left edge.  \n\nUP",

(0,8) is the closest apple.  \nBut being trapped on left edge for many moves is risky if enemy approaches. Having an escape option at (1,3) next turn is valuable.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nThis turn, only UP is safe anyway, so I must go UP.  \nNext turn, from (0,3), I will consider whether to continue UP toward apple or go RIGHT to gain space.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0,3), evaluate:  \n- If enemy is far and (0,8) still reachable safely, maybe continue UP.  \n- If enemy moves toward left side, consider RIGHT to (1,3) to avoid trap.  \n- Check if any new apples appear closer.  \n\nUP",

Also, UP keeps me away from enemy\u2019s possible LEFT move to (5,4), which is closer to my RIGHT path.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,4), aim for (2,6): go UP to (1,5) if safe, then RIGHT to (2,5), then UP to (2,6). Watch enemy movement; if enemy moves toward (5,4) or (6,3), adjust to avoid being cut off. Avoid trapping myself on left wall; consider moving right after apple.  \n\nUP",

If I go DOWN, I eat it immediately and grow to length 8.  \nOther apples: (0, 8) far left, (2, 9) near top left, (4, 2) far down, (0, 7) far left.  \n\nEating (5, 7) is good because it\u2019s close and gives me a point, but I must check safety after eating it:  \nIf I eat (5, 7), my new head is at (5, 7), my tail is at (1, 6) (since I grow, tail stays same until next move).  \nNext turn from (5, 7): possible moves?  \n- UP (5, 8): my old head position (now body segment 2) \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (5, 6): empty.  \n- LEFT (4, 7): empty (currently empty in board).  \n- RIGHT (6, 7): empty.  \n\nSo after eating apple, I\u2019d have 3 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). That\u2019s fine.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility for each safe move:**  \n\n1. **UP (5, 9):**  \nFrom (5, 9): UP off-board, DOWN (5, 8) body, LEFT (4, 9) empty, RIGHT (6, 9) empty \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\n2. **DOWN (5, 7):** (eat apple)  \nFrom (5, 7) next turn: as above, 3 safe moves.  \n\n3. **RIGHT (6, 8):**  \nFrom (6, 8): UP (6, 9) empty, DOWN (6, 7) empty, LEFT (5, 8) body, RIGHT (7, 8) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both give 3 safe moves next turn, UP only 2.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat after my move:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (5, 7), enemy could be at (9, 7) or (8, 6). Distance from (5, 7) to (9, 7) = 4, to (8, 6) = 3. Not adjacent, safe.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 8), enemy distance from (6, 8) to (9, 7) = 4, to (8, 6) = 2 \u2014 still not adjacent.  \n\nBoth safe.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEating apple now helps catch up in score (6 \u2192 7 vs enemy 11).  \nAlso, apple at (5, 7) is in a relatively open area.  \nIf I don\u2019t eat it now, enemy could move toward it later? Enemy is far, but maybe not impossible in 2\u20133 turns.  \n\nBetter to take it now and grow.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Check immediate death from eating apple:**  \nNo collision risk with enemy head this turn.  \nNo wall.  \nNot moving into own body (DOWN from (5, 8) to (5, 7) is currently apple, not body).  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDOWN gets apple, good mobility next turn, safe.  \nRIGHT also safe but misses apple this turn.  \nUP less mobility.  \n\nBest: **DOWN**.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (5, 7), check enemy position. Likely move LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT to stay safe and aim for (4, 2) or (2, 9) next. Avoid getting trapped near top left later.\n\nDOWN",

But need to check safety: (7, 1) is empty now (apple cell), so moving there next turn is safe unless enemy gets there first (unlikely).  \nSo from (6, 1), safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n3. **RIGHT (7, 2):**  \nFrom (7, 2):  \n- UP (7, 3): empty.  \n- DOWN (7, 1): apple, safe unless enemy moves there this turn (enemy is far).  \n- LEFT (6, 2): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (8, 2): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nUP gives only 2 safe moves next turn, so less flexible.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat after my move:**  \nEnemy will be at (3, 8) or (2, 9) next turn.  \nFrom my possible positions:  \n- (6, 3) far from enemy, safe.  \n- (6, 1) far from enemy, safe.  \n- (7, 2) far from enemy, safe.  \n\nNo immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term safety and apple path:**  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (8 vs 11). Need to target (7, 1) efficiently.  \nRIGHT (7, 2) gets me to x=7, then next turn DOWN to (7, 1) eats apple.  \nDOWN (6, 1) also gets me closer, then RIGHT to (7, 1) eats apple next turn.  \n\nBoth are equally close to apple in turns (1 more move to eat).  \nBut DOWN (6, 1) leaves me with option to go LEFT (5, 1) if enemy somehow threatens (7, 1), while RIGHT (7, 2) commits me to (7, 1) next turn unless I avoid it.  \n\nActually, if I go RIGHT now to (7, 2), next turn I could go DOWN to (7, 1) to eat apple, but if enemy moves toward (7, 1) from far away, they can\u2019t reach it before me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Tie-breaker: space and future options after eating apple**  \nEating apple at (7, 1) will grow my tail by 1. My tail end is at (5, 7). After eating, my body will be longer, but I\u2019ll be at (7, 1) with possible moves UP (7, 2) (body after move), LEFT (6, 1), DOWN (7, 0), RIGHT (8, 1). That\u2019s 3 safe moves likely.  \n\nIf I go DOWN now to (6, 1), then RIGHT to (7, 1) next turn, after eating I\u2019ll be at (7, 1) with similar options.  \n\nBoth fine, but RIGHT now gives slightly more central position and keeps distance from my body coil near left side.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Plan for next few turns:**  \nGo RIGHT now to (7, 2), then next turn DOWN to (7, 1) to eat apple unless enemy threatens (7, 1) \u2014 but enemy is far north, so safe. After eating, move to open area right side to avoid trapping myself in my own body.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRIGHT is best:  \n- Moves toward closest apple (7, 1) in x-direction.  \n- 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- No enemy threat.  \n- Sets up apple grab next turn.  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait, (4,1) is apple, from (5,1) to (4,1) is LEFT, not DOWN. So path: (7,1) \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (4,1).

My RIGHT move goes toward right edge but still open area. Enemy\u2019s body blocks top right, but I\u2019m at bottom right.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (9 vs 12). Need to collect apples safely. The apple at (4,1) is closest, but going LEFT now reduces mobility. Going RIGHT keeps options open and I can later go down then left toward (4,1) or (2,0).  \nAlso, enemy is long and coiled in top rows, so bottom half is safer for me.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Avoid dead ends:**  \nDOWN (7,0) leaves only 2 moves next turn, risk of trapping. LEFT (6,1) also only 2 moves. RIGHT (8,1) gives 3 moves and access to more open cells.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRIGHT is safest, keeps most options, avoids immediate danger, and positions to circle toward apples later.\n\nRIGHT",

To get there: need to go LEFT eventually.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\n1. **UP (8, 2):**  \nFrom (8, 2):  \n- UP (8, 3): empty.  \n- DOWN (8, 1): my old head? Wait, after moving, my old head is at (8,1) but that becomes my neck, so it\u2019s my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (7, 2): my body (third segment) \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (9, 2): empty.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n2. **DOWN (8, 0):**  \nFrom (8, 0):  \n- UP (8, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (8, -1): out of bounds \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (7, 0): empty.  \n- RIGHT (9, 0): empty.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n3. **RIGHT (9, 1):**  \nFrom (9, 1):  \n- UP (9, 2): empty.  \n- DOWN (9, 0): empty.  \n- LEFT (8, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (10, 1): out of bounds \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAll three give 2 safe moves next turn, so mobility is equal.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (9 vs 12). Need to collect (4, 1) soon.  \nGoing RIGHT (9, 1) puts me on the right edge, which reduces future options because only UP/DOWN/LEFT possible next turn, and LEFT goes back into my body unless I move up/down first.  \nGoing DOWN (8, 0) puts me near bottom edge, still far from (4, 1).  \nGoing UP (8, 2) moves me slightly away from (4, 1) in y, but I can then go LEFT from (8, 2) to (7, 2) \u2014 but (7, 2) is my body currently, but next turn my body will have moved? Let\u2019s check: if I move UP, my body shifts: head to (8, 2), old head (8,1) becomes segment 2, segment 2 (7,1) becomes segment 3, etc. So (7, 2) currently is my body (third segment), but after moving UP, the tail moves? Actually, no apple eaten, so length stays same, tail moves from (4,6) to (4,5)? Wait, the whole body shifts: new body will be: head (8,2), then (8,1), then (7,1), then (7,2), then (6,2), \u2026 So (7, 2) will be occupied (fourth segment). So from (8, 2), LEFT to (7, 2) is invalid next turn.  \n\nSo from (8, 2), safe moves next turn are UP (8, 3) and RIGHT (9, 2). That\u2019s not great.  \n\nActually, maybe DOWN is better for getting toward (4, 1): from (8, 0) next turn, I can go LEFT to (7, 0) (empty), then later up toward apple.  \n\nBut enemy is far away in top left, so bottom is safe.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid dead ends:**  \nAll three moves give 2 safe moves next turn, so no immediate trap. But RIGHT (9, 1) puts me on edge, which is riskier if enemy ever comes near.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Choose based on apple path:**  \nQuickest to (4, 1):  \nFrom (8, 1):  \n- DOWN (8, 0) \u2192 then LEFT (7, 0) \u2192 LEFT (6, 0) \u2192 LEFT (5, 0) \u2192 UP (5, 1) \u2192 LEFT (4, 1): 6 moves.  \n- UP (8, 2) \u2192 LEFT not possible next turn, so longer.  \n- RIGHT (9, 1) \u2192 makes it even longer.  \n\nSo DOWN is best for minimizing distance to (4, 1) given body constraints.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Check immediate danger after DOWN:**  \nFrom (8, 0), next turn safe moves: LEFT (7, 0) and RIGHT (9, 0). Both fine. Could go LEFT toward apple.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDOWN moves me toward the closest apple area while keeping safe from enemy and avoiding edges.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (8, 0), move LEFT toward (7, 0), then (6, 0), then up toward (4, 1), watching for enemy movement from top.  \n\nDOWN",

Eating apple also means tail stays put, which might slightly affect space, but currently not an issue.  \n\nGoing LEFT avoids eating apple now, leaving (5, 1) for later, but enemy is far away so no risk of them taking it soon. Still, eating now gets me closer to catching up in score.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nAfter eating (5, 1), I can go LEFT to (4, 1) next turn for another apple, then maybe toward (2, 0). Need to avoid getting trapped by my own long body in the bottom-left area later.

Need to keep collecting apples in bottom half while avoiding getting trapped by my own long body. The enemy is far away in top half for now, so focus on eating apples safely and keeping options open.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT to eat apple now, gain score, keep multiple options next turn.\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s close to my possible LEFT move, but not overlapping this turn.  \nIf I go LEFT to (2, 1), next turn enemy could be at (1, 2) if it goes DOWN. Then I could go UP to (2, 2) for apple, or DOWN to (2, 0) for apple, avoiding head-on.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy has 15 apples, I have 11. Need to catch up.  \nMy body occupies bottom rows (y=0,1,2) mostly right side. Moving left opens space and gets me to apples.  \nPlan: Go LEFT now to (2, 1). Next turn, assess enemy position. If enemy at (1, 2), maybe go DOWN to (2, 0) for apple, or LEFT to (1, 1) to stay safe and approach (1, 2) later. Avoid trapping myself. Keep options open.  \n\nLEFT gives best future flexibility and apple access.\n\nLEFT",

UP and LEFT have collision risk depending on enemy move.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (2, 0), (8, 8), (7, 6), (2, 2), (1, 9)  \n\nFrom my head (2, 1):  \n- UP (2, 2): apple.  \n- DOWN (2, 0): apple.  \n- LEFT (1, 1): no apple.  \n\nEating apple grows me, but must survive.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future moves from each safe option**  \n\nIf UP to (2, 2) and survive (enemy not at (2, 2)):  \nNext turn from (2, 2):  \n- UP (2, 3): empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 1): my old head \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (1, 2): enemy\u2019s current head location, but enemy will move.  \n- RIGHT (3, 2): my body at (3, 2)? Wait, my body: (3,1) is body, (4,1), etc. (3,2) is empty. Actually (3,2) is empty now, but after move my body shifts: head to (2,2), tail (6,2) removed, new segment added because apple eaten \u2192 body length increases by 1, so tail stays? Actually eating apple means tail doesn\u2019t move, so body becomes: new head (2,2), then old head (2,1) becomes new segment 2, then (3,1), (4,1), \u2026, (6,2) stays. So (3,2) is free. So UP, LEFT, RIGHT possible, DOWN blocked.  \n\nIf DOWN to (2, 0) and survive:  \nNext turn from (2, 0):  \n- UP (2, 1): my old head \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (2, -1): off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (1, 0): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3, 0): my body at (3,0)? After eating apple, body: head (2,0), then (2,1), (3,1), \u2026 (6,2). (3,0) is currently (5,0)? Wait, my body has (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0) in it. (3,0) is empty now and will stay empty after move. So LEFT and RIGHT possible.  \n\nIf LEFT to (1, 1) and survive (enemy not at (1, 1)):  \nNext turn from (1, 1):  \n- UP (1, 2): enemy\u2019s current head location, but enemy will move.  \n- DOWN (1, 0): empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 1): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 1): my old head \u2192 invalid.  \nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT possible.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nEnemy has 16 apples, I have 11. Dying is worse than missing an apple.  \n- UP: risk head-on if enemy goes RIGHT (to eat apple (2,2)).  \n- LEFT: risk head-on if enemy goes DOWN (to (1,1)).  \n- DOWN: no head-on risk this turn.  \n\nDOWN is safest this turn, plus it gets an apple.  \n\nAlso, enemy might avoid collision if it sees risk? But enemy might go for apple (2,2) if it wants it. If I go DOWN, I get apple (2,0) safely.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nAfter eating apple at (2,0), I\u2019ll be at (2,0) with length 12. Enemy length 17. Need to catch up but stay alive. From (2,0) I can go LEFT to (1,0) or RIGHT to (3,0). LEFT keeps me away from enemy\u2019s area (enemy at y=2+). RIGHT goes toward my body but (3,0) is free. Could then go up later.  \n\nPlan: Take safe apple at (2,0) now, then move left to open space near bottom left, maybe target apple (1,9) later via left column.\n\nDOWN",

(0, 0) is bottom-left corner.  \n\nEnemy might avoid (0, 0) if it feels trapped in corner with no escape later. But enemy is long (16 apples \u2192 length 17), so it needs space.  \n\nGiven no apple incentive, enemy might pick randomly or avoid risk. If I assume enemy avoids possible future traps, maybe (0, 0) is less attractive because corner limits next moves. But (1, 1) has more options next turn (UP, RIGHT, DOWN). So enemy might prefer (1, 1).  \n\nThus LEFT to (0, 0) might be slightly safer from head-on.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future moves after each**  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 0):  \nNext turn from (0, 0):  \n- UP (0, 1): enemy\u2019s current head location, but enemy will have moved. Could be empty or could be enemy\u2019s body if enemy went DOWN to (0, 0) and died with me. Wait \u2014 if we both go to (0, 0) this turn, we both die now, so no next turn. So if I survive, enemy didn\u2019t go to (0, 0). Then (0, 1) might be empty or enemy body?  \nActually if enemy went RIGHT to (1, 1), then (0, 1) is empty (old head pos). Then my moves from (0, 0): UP (0, 1) empty, RIGHT (1, 0) my body, DOWN off-board, LEFT off-board. So only UP possible next turn. That\u2019s risky \u2014 one option.  \n\nIf I go UP to (1, 1):  \nIf enemy didn\u2019t go RIGHT (so enemy went DOWN to (0, 0)), then (1, 1) is safe. Next turn from (1, 1):  \n- UP (1, 2): enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (1, 0): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (0, 1): empty (enemy\u2019s old head pos).  \n- RIGHT (2, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo only LEFT possible next turn. Also one option.  \n\nBoth moves lead to only one safe move next turn if I survive.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Which gives better survival odds this turn?**  \nWe must guess enemy\u2019s move.  \nIf enemy chooses randomly between its two moves, 50% chance each.  \n\n- If I choose LEFT (0, 0): die if enemy chooses DOWN (0, 0) \u2192 50% death now.  \n- If I choose UP (1, 1): die if enemy chooses RIGHT (1, 1) \u2192 50% death now.  \n\nEqual immediate risk.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term after surviving**  \nIf I survive LEFT: am at (0, 0), only UP next to (0, 1). From (0, 1) next:  \nPossible moves then: enemy body at (0, 2), (1, 2), etc. UP blocked, RIGHT maybe blocked by my body? Need to check. Might be tight but could go right along bottom later.  \n\nIf I survive UP: am at (1, 1), only LEFT next to (0, 1). From (0, 1) next:  \nSame situation as above essentially.  \n\nSo symmetrical.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Tiebreaker: apples and board**  \nApples: (8,8), (7,6), (2,2), (1,9), (6,3).  \nFrom (0, 0) or (1, 1), neither is closer to an apple directly, but (0, 0) \u2192 up the left side toward (1, 9) possible.  \nBut enemy\u2019s body blocks top left.  \n\nActually, enemy\u2019s body is along left column from (0, 2) up to (0, 8). So going up left column from (0, 0) will hit enemy body at (0, 2). So that\u2019s blocked.  \n\nFrom (1, 1), going left then up? Same issue.  \n\nMaybe better to choose the move that avoids likely enemy path: enemy might avoid corner, so maybe LEFT is slightly more likely to survive.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick LEFT.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** If I survive at (0, 0), go UP to (0, 1) if safe, then likely only RIGHT to (1, 1) or (1, 0) depending on body positions, aim to circle toward bottom right apples while avoiding enemy\u2019s long body in top half.  \n\nLEFT",
