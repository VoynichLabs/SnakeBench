That\u2019s a long way away.\n  - The next closest is (3,1), which is 3 rows down and 3 columns left. Still far.\n  - The farthest is (9,6), which is 3 rows down and 3 columns right.\n\n### **Immediate Safety Check**\n- **Off-board**: Moving up from (6,9) would go to (6,10) \u2192 invalid (off-board). So **UP is invalid**.\n- **Backward**: Moving down from (6,9) would go to (6,8) \u2192 valid (on-board).\n- **Left**: Moving left from (6,9) would go to (5,9) \u2192 valid.\n- **Right**: Moving right from (6,9) would go to (7,9) \u2192 valid.\n\n### **Enemy Collision Risk**\n- Enemy head is at (4,8). If you move left to (5,9), the enemy could move right to (5,8) and collide with your new head at (5,9) \u2192 invalid.\n- If you move right to (7,9), the enemy could move left to (4,9) \u2192 no immediate collision.\n- If you move down to (6,8), the enemy could move up to (4,7) \u2192 no immediate collision.\n\n### **Safe Moves**\n- **DOWN**: (6,8) \u2192 valid, no immediate collision risk.\n- **RIGHT**: (7,9) \u2192 valid, no immediate collision risk.\n- **LEFT**: (5,9) \u2192 invalid if enemy moves right.\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy**\n- You\u2019re at a corner with no body. Moving down or right opens up more space for future growth.\n- Moving down to (6,8) is safer because:\n  - It keeps you in the top-right quadrant, reducing risk of enemy head-on collisions.\n  - It\u2019s a more natural progression toward the apples (though still far).\n- Moving right to (7,9) is also safe but may leave you more exposed to enemy movement.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n**DOWN**\n\n*(The move is safe, avoids immediate enemy collision, and keeps options open for future growth.)*",

There seems to be a discrepancy. Assuming the head is at (6,7) based on the board state (since the last move info says \"Your snake (ID 1): Head: (6, 7)\").\n- **Body:** None (just a head).\n- **Apples:** (9,6), (3,2), (3,1), (6,1), (2,3) are visible.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 is at (6,8) with no body. It\u2019s vulnerable since it lacks a body segment.\n2. **Your Position:** At (6,7), which is adjacent to the enemy\u2019s head at (6,8). Moving directly into the enemy\u2019s head would kill you, so no direct collision risk yet.\n3. **Apple Proximity:** The closest apple is (6,1), which is 6 rows down. The next closest is (3,2) and (3,1), which are 3 rows up and left. The farthest is (9,6), which is 3 rows right and 3 rows down.\n4. **Safe Moves:**\n   - **UP:** (6,8) \u2192 Enemy\u2019s head is at (6,8). If you move up, you\u2019d collide with the enemy\u2019s head. **Risky.**\n   - **DOWN:** (6,6) \u2192 Valid, no immediate collision. This opens a path toward the apple at (6,1).\n   - **LEFT:** (5,7) \u2192 Valid, no immediate collision. This could lead to the apple at (3,2) or (3,1).\n   - **RIGHT:** (7,7) \u2192 Valid, no immediate collision. This could lead to the apple at (9,6).\n\n**Immediate Priorities:**\n- Avoid moving into the enemy\u2019s head (UP).\n- Among the other moves, prioritize those that:\n  - Keep the snake\u2019s body growth potential open (e.g., moving toward apples).\n  - Minimize exposure to enemy expansion (e.g., moving away from the enemy\u2019s potential path).\n\n**Enemy\u2019s Next Move:**\nThe enemy is at (6,8) with no body. It can move:\n- UP: (6,9) \u2192 Off-board (invalid).\n- DOWN: (6,7) \u2192 Collision with your head if you move down to (6,6). **Risky.**\n- LEFT: (5,8) \u2192 Valid.\n- RIGHT: (7,8) \u2192 Valid.\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (5,8), you could move LEFT to (5,7) to avoid collision.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (7,8), you could move RIGHT to (7,7) to avoid collision.\n\n**Apple Strategy:**\nThe apple at (6,1) is the closest and most strategic. Moving DOWN to (6,6) opens the path toward it. If you grow a body segment, you can expand further down.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nMove **DOWN** to (6,6).
