There are several apples on the board, located at (0, 7), (8, 2), (4, 9), (3, 2), and (3, 3). The enemy snake (ID 2) is at (6, 1) with no visible body.\n\nGiven the current position of my snake and the location of the apples, I have a few options. The closest apple is at (0, 7), which is down and to the left. However, moving in that direction would put me close to the edge of the board, which could be risky. Another option is to move up to (1, 9), which would put me closer to the apple at (4, 9). This might be a safer move, as it would keep me away from the edges of the board.\n\nAdditionally, I should be mindful of the enemy snake's position and avoid getting too close to it, as colliding with another snake would result in my death.\n\nConsidering all these factors, my strategy for this turn is to move UP to (1, 9). This will position me closer to the apple at (4, 9) while keeping me away from the edges of the board and the enemy snake.\n\nMy next move: UP"

I can move up (decrease y), down (increase y), left (decrease x), or right (increase x).\n\nSince I'm currently at (6, 1), moving up would take me to (6, 0), which is a wall. Moving down would take me to (6, 2), but there are no apples there. Moving left would take me to (5, 1), but there are no apples there either. Moving right would take me to (7, 1), and there is an apple at (8, 2), so I could potentially move there and grow.\n\nHowever, moving right also puts me closer to snake #1, which is at (1, 9). If I move too close to them, they might change direction and collide with me. To avoid this, I should try to keep a safe distance from other snakes.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to avoid other snakes and aim for apples that are further away from other snakes.\n\nNext move: LEFT (decrease x) to (5, 1), as it's the safest move for now and there are no apples there. This move allows me to keep a safe distance from snake #1 and potentially move towards an apple in the future."
