This reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are safe moves that reduce the distance to the nearest apple (2, 1) to 3. Moving RIGHT to (2, 4) places the snake in the same column as the apple (column 2), setting up a more direct path downwards to reach it.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Having moved to (2, 4), the snake will be in column 2. The nearest apple is at (2, 1). The next steps will likely involve moving DOWN towards row 1. I will find the safest move from the new position (2, 4) that continues progress towards the apple at (2, 1), while avoiding collisions with my body and the enemy snake.\n\nNext Move: RIGHT"

Current Position Analysis:\n   - I'm at (1, 9)\n   - My body extends to (1, 8)\n   - No apple at my current location\n\n2. Apple Proximity and Strategy:\n   - Closest apple locations:\n     * (5, 3)\n     * (7, 0)\n     * (6, 2)\n     * (8, 2)\n     * (6, 4)\n   - None of these apples are immediately adjacent to me\n\n3. Movement Considerations:\n   - Last move was UP\n   - Cannot go back DOWN (would hit own body)\n   - LEFT and RIGHT look like potential options\n   - Aiming to create a path towards apples\n\n4. Enemy Snake Awareness:\n   - Snake #0 is far away at (3, 1)\n   - No immediate threat to my movement\n\n5. Strategic Thinking:\n   - Need to explore board and get closer to apples\n   - Maintain flexibility in movement\n   - Avoid potential snake body or wall collisions\n\n6. Decision Factors:\n   - RIGHT seems more promising\n   - Opens up more board exploration\n   - Potential to get closer to apple cluster around (6, 2), (6, 4)\n\nNext Turn Strategy:\n- Continue exploring board\n- Keep track of apple locations\n- Maintain safe distance from other snakes\n- Be prepared to change direction quickly\n\nDecided Next Move: RIGHT"

          "rationale": "Rationale: My snake is at (4, 1) with body segments at [(3, 1), (2, 1)]. The safe moves are UP to (4, 2), DOWN to (4, 0), and RIGHT to (5, 1). Moving LEFT to (3, 1) would cause a collision with my body. The closest apples are at (5, 3) and (6, 2), both at a Manhattan distance of 3 from my current position.\nMoving UP to (4, 2) reduces the distance to (5, 3) and (6, 2) to 2, and also reduces distance to (8,2) and (6,4).\nMoving DOWN to (4, 0) increases the distance to (5, 3) and (6, 2) to 4, only getting closer to the farthest apple (7, 0).\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 1) also reduces the distance to (5, 3) and (6, 2) to 2, and also reduces distance to (7,0), (8,2) and (6,4).\nComparing UP and RIGHT, moving RIGHT to (5, 1) reduces the average distance to all apples more effectively (average distance 3.0 vs 3.4 for UP). It also positions the snake horizontally closer to the x-coordinates of the main cluster of apples. The enemy snake at (1, 9) is not a threat. Therefore, moving RIGHT is a safe move that positions the snake well to continue approaching the apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From the new position at (5,1), I will assess the positions of the remaining apples. I will prioritize moving towards the closest apples, which will likely be (5,3) or (6,2), by evaluating moves like UP to (5,2) or RIGHT to (6,1), while considering the safety of these moves relative to my body and the enemy snake.\n\nNext Move: RIGHT"
