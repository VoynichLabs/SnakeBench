Moving down from my current position (7, 8) would take me to (7, 7), which is out of bounds. Moving up would take me to (7, 9), but that's where I was last turn. Moving left would take me to (6, 8), and moving right would take me to (8, 8). Since I can\u2019t move down, and I need to avoid hitting the wall, I\u2019ll try moving right. Moving right might help me get closer to the apple at (7,6) as well, which is a key priority.\n\nRIGHT",
