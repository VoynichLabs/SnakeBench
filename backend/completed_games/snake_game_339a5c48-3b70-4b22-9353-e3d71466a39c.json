There are apples at $\\text{A} = \\{(1, 1), (5, 6), (5, 5), (3, 1), (5, 7)\\}$.\n\nMy goal is to eat an apple safely, prioritizing survival.\n\nMy body is currently just the head, $S_0 = [(5, 4)]$. The tail is $\\text{Tail}_0 = (5, 4)$.\nEnemy snake 1 body is just the head, $S_1 = [(5, 3)]$.\n\n### 1. Analyze potential moves for Snake 0 (Head at (5, 4))\n\nPossible destinations for my head:\n*   **UP**: (5, 5)\n*   **DOWN**: (5, 3)\n*   **LEFT**: (4, 4)\n*   **RIGHT**: (6, 4)\n\n### 2. Check for immediate self-collision or going off board\n\nAll destinations are within the $0-9$ range, so no immediate out-of-bounds deaths.\nSince my body is only one segment long, moving backward means moving into (5, 4), which is impossible as (5, 4) is my current position, not my potential next position. The rule about moving directly backwards into the body means if I move from $(x, y)$ to $(x', y')$, I must not move to the cell immediately behind $(x, y)$ *if* I had a body segment there. Since my body is only (5, 4), I cannot move onto (5, 4) in the next step unless the board physics allows occupying the current head spot temporarily, which is not standard. Standard movement means the old head spot becomes the new segment 2, or is vacated if I don't grow. Since I have no body, the only self-collision risk would be moving to a future segment, which doesn't exist yet. If I move to (5, 3), I only bump into the enemy head.\n\nLet's assess the moves based on eating apples or moving towards them, and collisions with Snake 1 head at (5, 3).\n\n**A. UP to (5, 5):**\n*   Apple present? No apple at (5, 5). (Apples are at (5, 6), (5, 5) is mine!)\n    *   Wait, re-checking apples: $\\text{A} = \\{(1, 1), (5, 6), (5, 5), (3, 1), (5, 7)\\}$. Yes, there is an apple at (5, 5).\n*   Collision with Snake 1 head at (5, 3)? No.\n*   Result: Safe move, eats an apple, snake grows to length 2. New head is (5, 5).\n\n**B. DOWN to (5, 3):**\n*   Apple present? No apple at (5, 3).\n*   Collision with Snake 1 head at (5, 3)? **Yes, head-on collision possible path!** If Snake 1 also moves away from (5, 4) or towards (5, 4), a collision might be avoided, but moving *to* (5, 3) means occupying the exact spot where Snake 1's head *currently* is. Since all moves happen simultaneously, this is not a direct collision pathway unless Snake 1 moves to (5, 4) or stays put (which it can't, unless it dies).\n    *   If I move DOWN to (5, 3): I land exactly where Snake 1 started.\n    *   Snake 1 (Head at (5, 3)) moves simultaneously.\n\n    We must check Snake 1's destinations:\n    Snake 1 potential moves: UP (5, 4), DOWN (5, 2), LEFT (4, 3), RIGHT (6, 3).\n\n    *   If Snake 1 moves UP to (5, 4): No collision. My head (5, 4) moves to (5, 3). Snake 1 head (5, 3) moves to (5, 4).\n    *   If Snake 1 moves DOWN to (5, 2): No collision.\n    *   If Snake 1 moves LEFT to (4, 3): No collision.\n    *   If Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (6, 3): No collision.\n    *   My move DOWN to (5, 3) does NOT immediately result in a head-on collision because the enemy snake head moves from (5, 3) simultaneously. The risk here is that if the enemy snake chose $(5, 4)$ as its move, we might have a collision if our path crossed. However, since we are only checking if we move *into* another snake's *current* spot, we are safe from collision with the *head* if the head moves away. We are safe because the game processes movement results on the final positions. I move to (5, 3). Snake 1 moves to $(x'_1, y'_1)$. We die if $(5, 3) = (x'_1, y'_1)$. Since Snake 1 cannot move to (5, 3), this move is safe regarding the enemy head *collision check*.\n    *   However, this move (DOWN) moves me into the cell immediately occupied by Snake 1's head. If Snake 1 moves to (5, 4), we do not collide based on final position. This move looks risky/neutral. It does not eat an apple.\n\n**C. LEFT to (4, 4):**\n*   Apple present? No.\n*   Collision with Snake 1 head at (5, 3)? No.\n*   Result: Safe move, no immediate gain.\n\n**D. RIGHT to (6, 4):**\n*   Apple present? No.\n*   Collision with Snake 1 head at (5, 3)? No.\n*   Result: Safe move, no immediate gain.\n\n### 3. Evaluating Safe Moves\n\nMove A (UP to (5, 5)) is the clear best option as it results in eating an apple, growing, and positioning the head near other apples (A at (5, 6) and (5, 7)).\n\nIf I choose UP:\nMy new head is (5, 5). My body is [(5, 5), (5, 4)]. I gain 1 apple.\nSnake 1 head is at (5, 3). Its movement possibilities are:\n1 is safe from dying, as it cannot move into (5, 5), (5, 4) (my body), or itself.\n\nIf Snake 1 moves UP to (5, 4), it moves into my new tail segment, which is safe for Snake 1.\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (5, 2).\nIf Snake 1 moves LEFT/RIGHT to (4, 3) or (6, 3).\n\nUP seems overwhelmingly the best move: guaranteed apple and growth, while maintaining clear space around the head.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Move towards the dense cluster of apples near $X=5$. Start by eating (5, 5).\n\nShort-term plan: Eat apples at (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7) sequentially if possible.\nNext turn, if I move UP again to (5, 6), I eat another apple. Snake 1 is currently blocking the path towards the apples at $X=1, 3$ unless it moves significantly. I should consolidate the central apples first.\n\nFinal decision: UP.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nPrioritize the sequence of apples (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 7). This maximizes immediate score gain and growth in a compact area. Assess Snake 1's position next turn to decide if moving towards western apples (1, 1), (3, 1) is necessary, or if Snake 1 is currently trapping me near $X=5$.\n\nMove: UP",

Snake 1 is near the bottom center. The nearest apples are far away. It might move towards the center (5, 3), up towards me (5, 3), or sideways.\n\n*   **UP to (5, 6):** Safe from Snake 1 at (5, 2). Eats an apple. Body becomes [(5, 5), (5, 4)]. This seems like the strongest move, continuing the push towards the excellent cluster of apples (5, 6), (5, 7).\n*   **LEFT to (4, 5):** Safe from Snake 1 at (5, 2). No apple.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 5):** Safe from Snake 1 at (5, 2). No apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 6), I eat another apple, increasing my score to 3. Snake 1 at (5, 2) is far enough away that a final position collision is extremely unlikely unless it also moves UP 3 times, which is impossible in one turn.\n\n### 3. Strategy Update\n\nThe path towards (5, 6) then (5, 7) is highly advantageous. Move UP again to claim (5, 6).\n\nLong-term plan:\n1. Claim (5, 6) -> (5, 7).\n2. Evaluate Snake 1's path. If it stays low, use the next move to evaluate moving left/right to pick up (3, 6) or (3, 1), (1, 1).\n3. Avoid moving into (5, 4), which is now my body segment following the move UP in turn 1.\n\nDecision: UP.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP",

Wait, this is only a collision if (5,5) is occupied by my body *after* I move. Since I move, the cell (5,5) is occupied by my segment 1. **Moving DOWN results in self-collision and death.**\n*   **LEFT**: (4, 6)\n*   **RIGHT**: (6, 6)\n\nLet's reconfirm the DOWN move risk based on the definition: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\nMy body is [(5, 5), (5, 4)]. Moving DOWN means my new head is (5, 5). This is segment 1 of my body. **DOWN is an immediate self-collision/death.**\n\n### 2. Evaluate remaining safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT)\n\n*   **UP to (5, 7)**: Eats an apple (Score 4). New body: [(5, 6), (5, 5)]. This continues a very successful path collecting adjacent apples.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6)**: No apple. New body: [(4, 6), (5, 6)].\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 6)**: No apple. New body: [(6, 6), (5, 6)].\n\n**Risk Assessment (Snake 1 at (5, 2))**\nSnake 1 is far away. Any move I make is safe from immediate collision with Snake 1's current position. We must anticipate its next position. It might move towards the center, or perhaps move sideways. It is small and unlikely to pose an immediate threat to my current vicinity unless it moves UP 3 times, which is impossible in one turn.\n\n**Preference: Move UP to (5, 7)**\nThis claims the last apple in this tight cluster, maximizing immediate score gain (4 apples). It leaves me in a good position to later move sideways to grab the (3, 6) apple.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (5, 7), the next target cluster is (3, 6). I should look to move LEFT or RIGHT on the next turn depending on the relative location of (3, 6) and my body length.\n\nDecision: UP.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP",

If it moves LEFT/RIGHT, it will be at (4, 0) or (6, 0). Since I am high up, I have plenty of time to maneuver before Snake 1 becomes relevant.\n\n### 4. Strategy Selection\n\nThe target apple is (3, 6). Moving LEFT to (4, 7) seems like a good preparatory move to transition towards the left side of the board to hunt (3, 6), while maximizing safety this turn. Moving UP means dedicating a turn to moving away from the core apple cluster.\n\nMove LEFT to (4, 7). This sets up a potential move to (3, 7) or (4, 6) next turn, closing in on (3, 6).\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving towards the (3, 6) apple. Prioritize safety from self-collision. After eating (3, 6), re-evaluate options for $(1, 1), (3, 1), (9, 1)$.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

Score is 4. My body is now [(3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. The tail vacated (5, 6) in the *previous* state, but since I ate, the tail did not move, so the body length increased by 1. Wait, let's re-verify the rule for growth when eating: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point\". If I moved from (3, 7) to (3, 6) and ate, the tail (5, 6) should now be the new tail segment, and the length increases by one.\n\nPrevious state (Turn 6 end): Head (3, 7), Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Tail position vacated: (5, 6).\nIf I moved DOWN to (3, 6) and ATE:\nNew body = [(3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 4. (The old tail position (5, 6) is now the position where the tail *would* have moved if I hadn't eaten, but since I ate, the tail stays put).\n\nLet's check the provided board state for Turn 7:\nYour snake (ID: 0): Head: (3, 6), Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. Length 5. Apples: 4.\n\nIf the final state shows length 5, it means the tail *did* move one step *before* the growth was accounted for, or the previous tail segment (which was (5, 6) before the move down) was incorporated into the new history, OR the initial body for turn 7 reflects the body *before* the eaten apple caused growth.\n\nLet's rely on the provided state for Turn 7:\nHead: (3, 6). Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. Length 5.\nThis implies the previous tail segment (5, 6) *did not* move (it remained in the body list), and the growth added a 5th segment (which is not explicitly shown as the new tail location). This usually means that if L=N before eating, L=N+1 after eating, and the old tail position remains the tail position.\nPrevious body length N=3: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)].\nIf I eat at (3, 6): New body should be [(3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 4.\n\nThe provided state for Turn 7 shows length 5: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. This means the body definition in the input might be slightly inconsistent with the narrative (L=4 if eating, L=5 if tail moved + growth did not happen, L=5 if tail moved by 1, then growth added another segment).\n\nGiven the input state: Head (3, 6), Body [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. The tail is (5, 6). This means the segment that was immediately behind (5, 7) was (5, 6) *before* the move, and since an apple was eaten, the tail did *not* retreat, and the new head is (3, 6).\nIf the body prior to the move was [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)] (Length 3):\nMove DOWN to (3, 6) and eat: New body = [(3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 4.\n\nThe provided board state for T7 seems to assume the body *before* the move was length 4 OR the segment (5, 6) was the tail *before* the move and it remained fixed while a new length 5 was formed.\nLet's assume the game logic determined the body is L=5: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)] was the body *before* the move, and the move was DOWN to (3, 6) which caused growth. If the body before move was L=4, and you eat, it becomes L=5.\nIf my body before T7 move was [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)] (L=4), and I moved from H=(3, 7) to H'=(3, 6) eating an apple:\nNew Body = [(3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. Length 5. This matches the provided state structure!\n\nConclusion: My body state *at the start of Turn 6* must have been 4 segments long, and the tail was (5, 6).\nStart T6: H=(3, 7), B=[(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. (Length 3? This is inconsistent).\n\nReviewing T5 state: H=(3, 7), B: [(4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. Length 4. Tail was (5, 6).\nMove LEFT to (3, 7). No eat. Tail moves to (5, 7).\nNew State T6 start: H=(3, 7), B=[(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 3. Tail position vacated: (5, 6). *This matched my rationale.*\n\nIf this is true, moving from H=(3, 7) to H'=(3, 6) eating an apple:\nNew H=(3, 6). New Body = [(3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 4.\nThe provided T7 state shows L=5: Head: (3, 6), Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. This implies the tail position (5, 6) was *not* vacated.\n\nI must operate based on the provided state for Turn 7, even if its derivation from T6 seems slightly ambiguous regarding tail movement vs growth mechanics. **My snake is currently Length 5, Head at (3, 6).**\nBody: [(3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. The tail is (5, 6).\n\n### 1. Analyze potential moves for Snake 0 (Head at (3, 6))\n\nPossible destinations:\n*   **UP**: (3, 7) - Collision with body segment 1. **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN**: (3, 5) - Safe. Sets up approach to (3, 1).\n*   **LEFT**: (2, 6) - Safe. Good transition towards (1, 1).\n*   **RIGHT**: (4, 6) - Safe.\n\n### 2. Evaluate remaining safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n\nRemaining Apples: $\\text{A} = \\{(1, 1), (3, 1), (9, 1)\\}$.\n\nI am currently at (3, 6). The cluster (1, 1) and (3, 1) is relatively close. (9, 1) is far away. I want to move towards the lower-left quadrant.\n\n*   **DOWN to (3, 5)**: Direct path towards (3, 1). If I go (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 1) (5 moves). Safe. New body: [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. (Tail (5, 6) retreats).\n*   **LEFT to (2, 6)**: Moves towards (1, 1) boundary. If I go (2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 5)... This seems slightly meandering compared to heading straight for the vertical line x=3. New body: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. (Tail (5, 6) retreats).\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 6)**: Moves away from the desired apples.\n\n### 3. Enemy Movement Prediction (Snake 1 at (5, 0))\n\nSnake 1 is still harmlessly far away. It might move UP towards (5, 1) or sideways. No immediate threat.\n\n### 4. Strategy Selection\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (3, 5) is the most efficient way to align for the next two apples at (3, 1) and (1, 1), as it keeps me on the vertical line x=3.\n\nIf I move DOWN: H=(3, 5). Tail retreats from (5, 6).\nNext move, I will likely choose DOWN again to (3, 4).\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move DOWN sequentially towards (3, 1). Try to snake around (3, 1) then move to (1, 1). Keep clear of Snake 1.\n\nMove DOWN.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nTurn: 8 / 150\n\nApples at: (1, 1), (3, 1), (9, 1)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 0) apples: 4\n  - Snake #1 apples: 0\n\nYour snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (3, 5)\n  - Body: [(3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]\n  - Apples collected: 4\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #1 - Head: (5, 0), Body: none, Apples: 0\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . .

The previous tail segment (3, 7) was absorbed and did not retreat in the final state list, indicating growth occurred and the tail position remains fixed relative to the main body mass, or the visualization is showing the length 6 snake correctly positioned after growth.\nThe provided body: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)]. Length 5. This is the same length as the previous turn (L=5), which implies the tail (3, 7) *did* retreat, and the growth only happened once in the state history (T7). This is confusing, but I must proceed assuming the state is the current reality: Head (3, 1), Body L=5, Tail (3, 6).\n\nIf L=5, and I ate an apple, the length should be 6. If the provided list is correct [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)], then the tail *did* retreat in the previous move cycle, meaning the growth from eating (3, 1) was *not* reflected as an increased length yet, or the provided list implies my body is [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)] and the list provided is missing the head segment?\nLet's trust the explicit Head/Body list: Head (3, 1). Body segments starting from the junction: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6). Length 5. This means the tail *did* retreat from (3, 7) during the move DOWN to (3, 1) that ate the apple. This implies that eating an apple *replaces* the tail retreat, but the length only reflects the current number of segments *excluding* the head that haven't moved. This is highly non-standard, but the only interpretation that fits L=5 body + 1 eat + tail retreat is: old L=5 was [(3, 2)...(3, 7)]. Move to (3, 1) EAT. New L=5 is [(3, 1), (3, 2)...(3, 6)]. The new segment added by eating is the one at (3, 1), meaning (3, 7) was retained, and the new head is (3, 1). Wait, no, if length didn't increase, it means the tail retreated.\n\nLet's assume standard rules apply: L=5 before move. Move to (3, 1) EAT -> L=6. New Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)]. If the provided body list [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)] is truly just the segments AFTER the head, then L=6 is correct. I will proceed assuming L=6, Head (3, 1).\n\nEnemy Snake 1 is at (5, 0).\n\nCurrent Apples: $\\text{A} = \\{(1, 1), (9, 1)\\}$. Target (1, 1) is 2 horizontal steps away.

Moving RIGHT seems most direct.\nIf we move RIGHT (5, 2), we set up for (6, 2) next turn. We can drop to y=1 when we reach x=8 or x=9.\n\nLet's check potential Snake 1 movement. If Snake 1 moves UP to (5, 1), it is now near my planned path if I were to drop down immediately. Since my body is currently at y=1/2, Snake 1 moving to y=1 might pose a future threat to the tail end if I drop too quickly.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 2): Body shifts right, tail leaves (1, 1). My body will occupy cells on y=1 from x=1 to x=3.\n\nLet's try to maintain height around y=2 for rapid horizontal transit. Move **RIGHT** to (5, 2).\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move RIGHT sequentially until x=8 or x=9, then drop to y=1.

If it stayed put, it is at (5, 0). Let's assume it moved UP based on nearest apple cluster (although that cluster is mostly gone). If it moved UP to (5, 1), it is directly below my head position, though 1 unit down.\n\nCurrent Apple: $\\text{A} = \\{(9, 1)\\}$.\n\n### 1. Analyze potential moves for Snake 0 (Head at (5, 2))\n\nPossible destinations:\n*   **UP**: (5, 3) - Safe.\n*   **DOWN**: (5, 1) - **DANGER**: Potential head-on collision if Snake 1 is at (5, 1). If Snake 1 is at (5, 0), I move to (5, 1) and it moves to (5, 1) or (5, 2).\n    *   If Snake 1 stays at (5, 0) -> My move DOWN to (5, 1) is safe from collision, but the tail of my snake retreats from (1, 2).\n    *   If Snake 1 moves UP to (5, 1) -> Head-on collision at (5, 1). **DEAD**.\n    *   If Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (6, 0) -> My move DOWN to (5, 1) is safe.\n\nSince I don't know Snake 1's move until after I choose mine, I must assume the worst case (Snake 1 moves UP to (5, 1)) or choose a move that avoids occupying the same cell AND avoids moving into the other snake's known position (5, 0).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 1), and Snake 1 moves UP to (5, 1) -> We both die. This is too risky.\n\n*   **LEFT**: (4, 2) - Collision with body segment 1. **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT**: (6, 2) - Safe. Direct path continuation.\n\nSafe moves are UP (5, 3) and RIGHT (6, 2).\n\n### 2. Strategy Selection\n\nMoving towards (9, 1) is still the goal. Moving **RIGHT** is superior to moving UP. (5, 3) is okay if we are blocked from moving right, but for now, RIGHT feels better.\n\nMove **RIGHT** to (6, 2).\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue rightward path, aiming to reach x=8 or x=9 at y=2, then drop to y=1 to collect (9, 1).

If it moved UP aggressively, it might be at (5, 3) or (5, 4) by now if it chased apples (but there are no apples near it). If it is still purely conservative/random, it is likely around y=0 or y=1. Let's check potential worst-case collision points on Y=1.\n\nCurrent Apple: $\\text{A} = \\{(9, 1)\\}$.\n\n### 1. Analyze potential moves for Snake 0 (Head at (8, 2))\n\nPossible destinations:\n*   **UP**: (8, 3) - Safe.\n*   **DOWN**: (8, 1) - Safe IF Snake 1 is NOT at (8, 1) OR if Snake 1 is moving AWAY from (8, 1) OR if Snake 1 moved to (8, 0) or (8, 2) etc.\n\nTo assess the collision risk at (8, 1):\nSnake 1 head H1 is at (5, 0).\nIf H1 moves UP -> (5, 1). Safe for me to move to (8, 1).\nIf H1 moves RIGHT -> (6, 0). Safe for me to move to (8, 1).\nIf H1 moves LEFT -> (4, 0). Safe for me to move to (8, 1).\n\nSince Snake 1 is too small and too far to pose an immediate threat to the head at (8, 2) by moving into (8, 1) this turn, moving **DOWN** to (8, 1) is the best option to set up for the final apple (9, 1).\n\n*   **LEFT**: (7, 2) - Collision with body segment 1. **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT**: (9, 2) - Safe. Gets me right next to the apple column.\n\nSafe moves: UP (8, 3), DOWN (8, 1), RIGHT (9, 2).\n\n### 2. Strategy Selection\n\nWe are close. We could go RIGHT to (9, 2) and then DOWN to (9, 1) next turn. OR DOWN to (8, 1) and then RIGHT to (9, 1) next turn. Both take 2 moves.\n\nIf we choose DOWN to (8, 1): Next move RIGHT to (9, 1) eats the apple, score 7. Body grows.\nIf we choose RIGHT to (9, 2): Next move DOWN to (9, 1) eats the apple, score 7. Body grows.\n\nIf Snake 1 has moved to (5, 1), moving RIGHT to (9, 2) keeps us away from it. Moving DOWN to (8, 1) puts us one step closer to its potential path if it decides to move right along y=1. Maintaining distance from snake 1 seems prudent, although it's currently non-aggressive.\n\nLet's stick to the plan of reaching y=1 via the shortest path. $\\text{H}=(8, 2) \\to (8, 1) \\to (9, 1)$ or $\\text{H}=(8, 2) \\to (9, 2) \\to (9, 1)$.\n\nI choose **DOWN** to (8, 1).
