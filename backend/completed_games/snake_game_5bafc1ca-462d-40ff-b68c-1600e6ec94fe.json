Moving there risks an unpredictable head-on outcome; while it can be safe if the enemy moves away (or they might move into my head and die), it's unnecessary risk when a safe apple-directed alternative exists.\n- UP -> (5,5): legal and moves me closer to the cluster of apples around y=5. (Note: (6,5) is occupied by my body so RIGHT from there would be blocked.)\n- LEFT -> (4,4): legal, moves toward the nearby apples (notably (3,5)) while keeping distance from the enemy at (5,3).\n\nI prefer a conservative, apple-focused move that avoids close contact with the lone enemy head. LEFT brings me closer to the apple at (3,5) while steering away from the enemy and keeping multiple escape routes open (up, left, down from the new position), minimizing the chance of getting boxed in or forced into a risky head-on.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Head toward the (3,5)/(1,5)/(2,6) cluster, taking apples while maintaining at least two exit directions from my head each turn.\n- Avoid moving into the column where the enemy is centered unless I have a clear numerical/positional advantage; force the enemy to be the one taking suicidal moves if possible.\n\nLEFT",
