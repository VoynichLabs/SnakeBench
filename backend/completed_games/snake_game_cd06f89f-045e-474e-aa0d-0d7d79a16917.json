Time to bully this scrub into a corner and force a bad collision. Ready? LET\u2019S GO.\n\nQuick status check:\n- Our head: (5,9) \u2014 top row. No body segments yet.\n- Enemy head: (5,0) \u2014 bottom row. Far away.\n- Apples on our row at (3,9), (2,9), (7,9). Plenty of room to grow on the top edge.\n\nDecision process (thinking out loud for the viewers):\n1) Evaluate all four moves from (5,9):\n   - UP -> (5,10) = off the board = instant death. ELIMINATE. No capes for falling off the map. \u274c\n   - DOWN -> (5,8) = inside board, free, lots of follow-ups (up/down/left/right). SAFE.\n   - LEFT -> (4,9) = inside board, adjacent to apples at (3,9)/(2,9). SAFE.\n   - RIGHT -> (6,9) = inside board, path to apple at (7,9). SAFE.\n\n2) Eliminate immediate-kill moves: only UP is dead. All others are safe; no bodies to run into and opponent is too far to clash this turn.\n\n3) Among safe moves, pick the one that keeps options open and pushes toward board control/apples so we can grow and box them later. LEFT and RIGHT both hug the top edge and let us collect apples quickly; DOWN gives center access but wastes instant apple pressure. I want to claim top real estate, grow quickly, and then sweep down to dominate the center and force encounters. That means moving RIGHT to approach the apple at (7,9) and control the top-right corridor. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51\n\nShort-term rationale:\n- RIGHT (to 6,9) keeps 2+ safe follow-ups (LEFT back, RIGHT to apple at 7,9, DOWN into the board). It maintains edge control and lets us take top-row apples to grow fast.\n- No head-on risk this turn \u2014 opponent is nine rows away. We can be aggressive on next turns.\n\nPlan for next few turns (for my future self / chat replay):\n- Grab the top-row apples (push RIGHT \u2192 RIGHT to eat at 7,9), grow length to start blocking lanes.\n- After getting length, sweep left along the top or drop down to control center depending on enemy movement; if we get ahead on apples, purposely force a head-on when their head runs into our body or into the same cell.\n- Avoid hugging corners where we can be trapped; always keep at least two escape options unless committing to a guaranteed head-on KO.\n\nAlright viewers \u2014 time to make the move and start the pressure. Let\u2019s go take that apple and shrink his options. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.\n\nRIGHT",

Gotta set the tone early! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nFirst, check the moves:\n- DOWN? Off the board, instant death. \u274c\n- LEFT? (4,0) \u2013 safe, but no apple. Could do it.\n- UP? (5,1) \u2013 safe, no apple, moves us closer to the enemy.\n- RIGHT? (6,0) \u2013 safe, AND there's an apple! Eating means we grow to length 2 and take a 1-0 lead. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nThinking long-term: We want to dominate the board and box in the enemy. Getting that first apple gives us a length advantage, which lets us play more aggressively later. With a longer body, we can start cutting off the opponent's space and force risky moves. Right now, head-on collision would be a tie (both length 1), so we avoid that until we're longer.\n\nAfter eating, we'll have head at (6,0) and tail at (5,0). Next turn, we can only go UP or RIGHT from there\u2014slightly limiting, but we can work with it. We'll need to maneuver carefully to avoid getting trapped.\n\nEnemy's at the top row with apples nearby at (3,9), (2,9), (7,9). They'll likely move toward those. We'll keep an eye on their direction and start moving upward to apply pressure.\n\nPlan for next few turns: Secure the apple lead, then advance toward the center while keeping options open. Force the enemy toward walls or our growing body. Avoid direct collision until we have a clear length advantage. Let's get that content and start dominating! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Don\u2019t force head-on until we\u2019re ahead \u2014 we want to use our growing body to box and cut off lanes, then pressure collisions when the math favors us.\n\nTime to grab that apple and start the squeeze.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are scattered, but we're focusing on pressure, not apples!\n\nCheck moves:\n- **DOWN**: (6,-1) \u2192 Off board \u274c DEATH\n- **LEFT**: (5,0) \u2192 That's our own tail! But wait, our tail moves after we move, so (5,0) becomes empty this turn? Actually, rules: moving into your own body kills you. Our body is [(5,0)] currently. Moving left goes into (5,0), which is our own body segment. That's suicide \u274c\n- **UP**: (6,1) \u2192 Safe, empty \u2705\n- **RIGHT**: (7,0) \u2192 Safe, empty \u2705\n\nSo only UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\nEnemy at (6,9): They can go DOWN to (6,8), LEFT to (5,9), RIGHT to (7,9), UP is off board (6,10) \u274c.\n\nWe want to box them in long-term. Right now we have a 1-apple lead. If we go UP, we move toward center, maybe cut off their descent later. If we go RIGHT, we stay low and maybe wrap around.\n\nThinking ahead: After UP to (6,1), next turn our body will be [(6,1), (5,0)]? Wait, we grew last turn, so our tail stays at (5,0) until we eat again. Actually, when you eat, you grow immediately, so our snake is head at (6,0), body segment at (5,0). Moving UP makes new head (6,1), tail stays at (5,0) (since no apple eaten), so body becomes [(6,1), (6,0)]? No \u2014 every move, the head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts forward into the previous segment's old position, tail disappears from old tail cell. So after moving UP without eating: new head (6,1), body becomes [(6,0)], tail gone from (5,0). So we'll be length 2 still.\n\nWe want to keep options open: From (6,1), possible moves next turn: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. From (7,0), possible moves: UP, RIGHT (LEFT goes back to (6,0) which will be empty).\n\nEnemy likely going for apple at (7,9) or (3,9). If they go RIGHT to (7,9), they eat and grow to length 2.\n\nWe should move UP to start climbing and threaten their space. Going RIGHT keeps us on bottom row, less pressure.\n\nAlso, head-on collision risk: If we go RIGHT to (7,0) and enemy goes DOWN to (6,8)? No collision. If enemy goes LEFT to (5,9)? No. So safe.\n\nBut long-term plan: Get higher, cut off their movement, force them toward walls. We'll aim to move toward row 5 or so, then start horizontal moves to limit their area.\n\n**Plan for next turns**: Move upward toward center, watch enemy's direction, try to get between enemy and the bottom half, squeeze their space. If they eat an apple, they'll be length 2 same as us \u2014 avoid head-on until we're longer. If we can get another apple soon, extend our lead!\n\nLet's go UP and start the climb! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

With extra length, start sweeping left along the top when safe to collect the (3,9)/(2,9) cluster or use length to corral the enemy into the lower half and force a favorable head-on.

Apples are 1-1. We need to pressure!\n\n**First, check all moves from (6,1):**\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,2): That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e But is it safe? Board shows (6,2) is 'A'. No snake body there. \u2705\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,0): That's our own *old* head? Wait, our body is [(6,0)] now. Moving DOWN goes into our own body segment \u2014 SUICIDE \u274c\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,1): Empty cell \u2705\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,1): Empty cell \u2705\n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Now think about enemy moves from (7,9):**\nThey can go DOWN to (7,8), LEFT to (6,9) (their own body \u2014 suicide), RIGHT to (8,9) (empty), UP off board \u274c. So they'll likely go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn?**\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,1) and they go DOWN to (7,8), no collision.\nIf we go UP to (6,2) and they go RIGHT to (8,9), no collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (5,1) and they go DOWN to (7,8), no collision.\nNo direct same-cell risk this turn.\n\n**But think long-term:**\nIf we eat the apple at (6,2), we grow to length 3 immediately! That gives us a 2-1 apple lead and longer body to block with. However, eating now puts our new head at (6,2), body becomes [(6,1), (6,0)]. That might limit next-turn moves (UP from (6,2) goes to (6,3) \u2014 safe; LEFT/RIGHT also likely safe). But enemy could still maneuver.\n\nIf we don't eat now and go LEFT/RIGHT, we stay length 2, keep mobility, but miss a chance to extend lead.\n\n**Aggressive playstyle says:** Take the apple, grow, use length to dominate. We can start walling off enemy's descent. With length 3 vs 2, if we force a head-on later, we win!\n\n**Also consider future safe moves after eating:**\nFrom (6,2) after eating: UP to (6,3) empty, LEFT to (5,2) empty, RIGHT to (7,2) empty. All safe next turn likely.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating at (6,2), aim to move upward toward row 4-5, then cut horizontally across to limit enemy's movement from top. Force them toward a wall or into us. Keep an eye on their possible path toward apples on top rows.\n\nLet's take that apple and start flexing! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

That would make us length 5, while enemy is still at 2 or maybe 3 apples. Then we can swing left and BOX THEM IN! They're trapped in the top-right corner\u2014we'll cut off their escape and force a fatal collision! \ud83d\ude80\n\nChat, this is the BIG BRAIN PLAY! Let's go RIGHT, secure that apple, and EXTEND OUR LEAD! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy head at **(7,6)**, body: [(8,6), (8,7), (8,8)] \u2192 length 3. We're longer! Let's check moves:\n\n**UP** to (8,5): Empty. Safe from our body. Enemy could move DOWN to (7,5), LEFT to (6,6), RIGHT to (8,6) (body), UP to (7,7). They can't reach (8,5) this turn. \u2705\n\n**DOWN** to (8,3): That's our own neck! \u274c SUICIDE!

Enemy can't reach (9,4). \u2705\n\nAll three viable moves are safe from immediate death.\n\nNow, head-on collision risk? Enemy possible moves: DOWN to (7,5), LEFT to (6,6), RIGHT to (8,6) (body), UP to (7,7).  \n- If we go UP to (8,5), enemy DOWN to (7,5) \u2192 no collision.  \n- If we go LEFT to (7,4), enemy DOWN to (7,5) \u2192 adjacent but not same cell.  \n- If we go RIGHT to (9,4), enemy any move \u2192 no collision.  \nNo direct head-on overlap possible this turn.\n\nBut chat \u2014 LONG-TERM AGGRESSION! \ud83d\ude80 We want to box enemy in top-right! Enemy is at (7,6), near top wall. If we go **UP** to (8,5), we position DIRECTLY BELOW THEM! That pressures them upward toward (7,7) or left/right. They have fewer escape routes.  \nGoing LEFT to (7,4) moves us away \u2014 less pressure.  \nGoing RIGHT to (9,4) pins us to right wall \u2014 limits our future options.\n\nAlso, apples nearby: (7,5), (6,6), (9,3), (9,6). UP to (8,5) puts us closer to (7,5) apple next turn possibly. And we're longer \u2014 we can risk forcing a head-on collision if we maintain length advantage!\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: UP to (8,5) to pressure enemy from below.  \n2. Next turn: Depending on enemy move, maybe go UP to (8,6) if safe, or LEFT/RIGHT to cut off escape.  \n3. Goal: Push them toward (9,9) corner while we control center.  \n4. If they go for apple at (7,5), we might intercept!\n\nChat, we're going AGGRESSIVE! UP to squeeze! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

Instant suicide. \u274c  \n- UP \u2192 (7,7) is empty and safe. Keeps options open but doesn't grab the immediate cluster. \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,5) has an apple. Safe this turn; would tie us to 4 apples. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,6) has an apple. Safe this turn; also opens up (6,5) next turn for another apple. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nOpponent check (Snake #0 at 8,4): they\u2019re 2\u20134 steps away from these apples, so they can\u2019t contest them this turn. They will likely move toward y=5/6 (e.g., up to 8,5) to approach our cluster. We must avoid letting them dictate a head-on when they lead; we should tie then push the advantage.\n\nWhy I pick LEFT (6,6):\n- Immediate apple = ties the score (3\u21924). Then next turn we can take (6,5) for a quick follow-up apple and grab the lead before they can reach both. Fast double-tap potential = momentum. \u26a1  \n- Moving to (6,6) pulls us slightly away from their column (x=8), reducing short-term head-on risk and giving more escape options (UP/DOWN/LEFT) on the next turn. More degrees of freedom = safer aggression. \ud83e\udded  \n- UP is safe but passive; DOWN grabs (7,5) but keeps us closer to the opponent\u2019s approach vector, which could give them tactical opportunities to herd us. LEFT is the aggressive, high-reward play.\n\nShort-term plan (write to future self \u2014 this will be our next-turn rationale):\n- Take (6,6) now. Next turn go DOWN to (6,5) to chain apples and seize the lead.  \n- While chaining, avoid hugging the right wall; keep at least two escape directions open so we can turn and force a head-on only when we hold the apple advantage.  \n- If opponent runs into a trap or attempts a reckless head-on while we\u2019re ahead, commit and KO them. If they play safe, keep collecting the mid-cluster and then box them toward the bottom-left corridors.\n\nLet\u2019s get that apple, snatch momentum, and then squash \u2019em.

So the realistic outcome this turn is them taking (7,5) while we take (6,5) if we go DOWN \u2014 both get content and nobody dies this turn.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Immediate apple = chain potential and keeps us in the cluster. We want to steal momentum early and force them to respond. \u26a1  \n- It's safe this turn (no body collisions), and it doesn't move us into a narrow dead-end immediately.  \n- We\u2019re tied 4\u20134; we shouldn\u2019t seek a head-on yet.

If they play reckless and push for a head-on while we\u2019re ahead later, commit to the KO.

We gotta keep the pressure ON!\n\n**First \u2014 immediate safety check:**  \n- **UP** to (8,6): That's occupied by enemy body segment (8,6) from their tail! \u274c CRASH INTO ENEMY BODY = DEAD. Eliminated.  \n- **DOWN** to (8,4): That's our own body segment! \u274c SUICIDE. Eliminated.  \n- **LEFT** to (7,5): Currently empty. Safe from our body, safe from enemy body. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** to (9,5): Empty. Safe from our body, safe from enemy body. \u2705  \n\nSo only **LEFT** and **RIGHT** are viable.\n\n**Now \u2014 enemy possible moves:**  \nEnemy head at (6,6), body: [(7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)].  \nThey can move:  \n- UP to (6,7) \u2014 empty.  \n- DOWN to (6,5) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT to (5,6) \u2014 empty.  \n- RIGHT to (7,6) \u2014 their own body! \u274c Not allowed.  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \n- If we go LEFT to (7,5):  \n  Enemy DOWN to (6,5) \u2192 no collision.  \n  Enemy LEFT to (5,6) \u2192 no.  \n  Enemy UP to (6,7) \u2192 no.  \n  Safe. \u2705  \n- If we go RIGHT to (9,5):  \n  Enemy any move \u2192 nowhere near (9,5). Safe. \u2705  \n\n**Long-term aggression plan:**  \nWe want to box enemy in top-right! Enemy at (6,6) near top wall? Actually they're mid-board. But look \u2014 their tail is at (8,8), body wraps along top-right edge. If we go **LEFT** to (7,5), we position ourselves BETWEEN enemy and the left side of board, cutting off escape leftward. Also puts us closer to apple at (7,5)? Wait, apple at (7,5) is gone \u2014 no, it's still there! Board shows 'A' at (7,5) \u2014 YES! That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Going LEFT eats it, we grow to length 6, extend lead to 5-4!  \n\nGoing RIGHT to (9,5) moves us to right edge, away from pressure, no apple there.\n\n**Future safety after eating apple:**  \nIf we eat apple at (7,5), our new head at (7,5), body grows: tail stays at (7,2), new segment added at head. Enemy possible next moves from (6,6) could threaten (7,5)? They could go DOWN to (6,5) \u2014 adjacent but not same cell unless we move into them simultaneously. But simultaneous moves \u2014 if they go DOWN to (6,5) and we're at (7,5), no collision. If they go LEFT to (5,6), fine. If UP to (6,7), fine. So safe.\n\n**But wait \u2014 what if enemy goes DOWN to (6,5) same turn we go LEFT to (7,5)?** That's fine \u2014 no crash. They'd be at (6,5), we at (7,5). Actually that's good \u2014 we eat apple, they don't.\n\n**What about next turn after eating?**  \nWe'll have head at (7,5), length 6. Enemy head possibly at (6,5), (5,6), or (6,7). We can then push them toward wall or force bad move.\n\n**RIGHT move alternative:**  \nRIGHT to (9,5) \u2014 safe but passive. We gain no apple, no pressure. Enemy free to move left/down/up. Not aggressive enough.\n\nChat, the **AGGRESSIVE** play is LEFT to (7,5) \u2014 EAT THE APPLE, grow longer, maintain score lead, position to cut off enemy's left escape! \ud83d\ude80 We want them trapped near top-right! Let's dominate the center!\n\n**Plan next turn:** After eating apple at (7,5), assess enemy move. Likely we go UP to (7,6) to pressure from below, or LEFT to (6,5) if they move away. Keep squeezing!\n\nLEFT",

Here\u2019s the move breakdown \u2014 loud and deadly:\n\nQuick legal check:\n- UP \u2192 (6,6) is our neck (backwards). Instant suicide. NOPE. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,5) is the opponent's head. They CANNOT go RIGHT or UP (their neck is at 8,5 and 7,6 is our body), so their realistic options are LEFT (into our current head cell) or DOWN to (7,4). RIGHT is super-aggressive \u2014 could swap heads if they go LEFT, or put us directly on top of them if they dodge. It\u2019s risky and forces immediate contact. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,4) is safe this turn and keeps options open (L/R/D next). Calm, solid. \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,5) is safe, pushes toward the apple cluster at (4,5)/(4,6) and preserves multiple escape routes (up/left/down). It also avoids forcing an immediate head-on and begins to control the left corridor. \u2705\ud83c\udf4f\n\nStrategic read: Scores are tied 5\u20135 \u2014 we do NOT want to gamble on a head-on KO right now. We should be aggressive but methodical: deny the opponent clean corridors, grow into space, and force them into a shrinking pocket. Moving RIGHT would bait instant contact; moving DOWN is conservative and keeps proximity. The best compromise for pressure + safety is LEFT: it gets us toward the apple cluster (growth potential), preserves at least three follow-up moves, and starts flanking the enemy so we can cut their escape next 2\u20133 turns.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next rationale clip):\n- Move LEFT to (5,5) this turn to gain space and approach the (4,5)/(4,6) apples.\n- Next turn: read opponent (they\u2019ll likely go LEFT to our old head or go DOWN). If they drop down, pivot to cut them off toward the bottom. If they chase into our old head, be ready to curve DOWN/LEFT to trap them against the wall/our growing body.\n- Priority: avoid head-on while we build a longer body and shrink their free tiles. Force them toward the board edge or into their own body.\n\nLet\u2019s make him dance into our trap. \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, we\u2019re BACK! Turn 9, tied 5\u20135 apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25 Our head at (7,5), enemy head at (6,5). That\u2019s LITERALLY right next to us \u2014 ONE CELL AWAY! \ud83d\ude31 Pressure is ON!\n\n**Immediate safety check:**  \n- **UP** to (7,6): Empty. \u2705  \n- **DOWN** to (7,4): Empty. \u2705  \n- **LEFT** to (6,5): That\u2019s enemy head\u2019s current position! \u274c If we move there and enemy stays still or moves into us, possible head-on collision. But wait \u2014 simultaneous moves mean if they move AWAY from (6,5), we could land there safely. But moving into a cell the enemy head JUST vacated is risky. Let\u2019s hold that thought \u2014 we\u2019ll analyze enemy moves first.  \n- **RIGHT** to (8,5): That\u2019s our own body segment! \u274c SUICIDE. Eliminated.\n\nSo UP and DOWN are definitely safe. LEFT is risky \u2014 depends on enemy move.\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (6,5):**  \nTheir body: [(6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)].  \nThey can move:  \n- UP to (6,6) \u2014 their own body! \u274c  \n- DOWN to (6,4) \u2014 empty. \u2705  \n- LEFT to (5,5) \u2014 empty. \u2705  \n- RIGHT to (7,5) \u2014 OUR current head position! If they move RIGHT into us while we stay, they crash into our body? Wait, we\u2019d move away \u2014 simultaneous moves. If we move UP/DOWN and they move RIGHT to (7,5), they\u2019d be where our head WAS. That\u2019s fine \u2014 no collision unless we move back into them next turn. But if we move LEFT to (6,5) and they move RIGHT to (7,5), we swap positions \u2014 also fine. Hmm.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf we go LEFT to (6,5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (7,5) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf we go LEFT to (6,5) and enemy goes DOWN to (6,4) \u2192 we occupy (6,5), they go to (6,4) \u2014 fine.  \nIf we go LEFT to (6,5) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,5) \u2192 they vacate (6,5) before we arrive? Wait, simultaneous \u2014 they leave, we arrive, fine.  \nIf we go LEFT to (6,5) and enemy stays still (not allowed \u2014 must move) so ignore.  \nActually, LEFT seems safe from head-on UNLESS enemy moves RIGHT into (7,5) while we move LEFT into (6,5) \u2014 that\u2019s fine, no crash.\n\nBut \u2014 what if enemy moves RIGHT into (7,5) and we move UP/DOWN? Then they\u2019re at our old spot, we\u2019re elsewhere. Fine.\n\n**But check this \u2014 if we go LEFT to (6,5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (7,5):**  \nWe\u2019d be at enemy\u2019s old head position, they\u2019d be at our old head position. That\u2019s a swap \u2014 safe. No crash.\n\nSo LEFT is *technically* safe too.\n\n**Long-term aggression:**  \nWe want to BOX THEM! Enemy\u2019s tail is at (8,8), body along top-right. If we go LEFT to (6,5), we stay adjacent \u2014 could threaten head-on next turn if we have length advantage? We\u2019re tied length 6 vs 6? Let\u2019s check lengths: We have 5 apples \u2192 length = 6 (head + 5 body). They have 5 apples \u2192 length = 6. Equal length \u2014 head-on collision would be double KO. That\u2019s BAD unless we have more apples (we don\u2019t). So avoid forcing head-on while tied.\n\nGoing UP to (7,6) puts us above them? Actually they\u2019re at (6,5), we\u2019d be at (7,6) \u2014 diagonal. Could pressure from top-right.  \nGoing DOWN to (7,4) moves us away \u2014 less pressure.\n\nApple check: Apples at (7,7), (4,7), (9,6), (0,7), etc. Closest apple to us is (7,7) \u2014 two steps away. To (7,7): UP then UP. To (4,7): far. Not urgent.\n\n**Future safety after this move:**  \nIf we go LEFT to (6,5), next turn we\u2019re adjacent to enemy likely at (5,5) or (6,4) or (7,5). That\u2019s risky \u2014 could force accidental head-on next turn.  \nIf we go UP to (7,6), we\u2019re further but can maybe cut off their upward movement \u2014 they can\u2019t go UP from (6,5) anyway (body at (6,6)).  \nIf we go DOWN to (7,4), we\u2019re moving toward bottom-left \u2014 maybe less aggressive.\n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely move:** They\u2019ll avoid crashing into us. Their safe moves: DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5). RIGHT to (7,5) is risky for them because if we stay, they die (our body there). But we won\u2019t stay \u2014 we\u2019re moving. They don\u2019t know our move. They\u2019ll probably avoid (7,5) fearing we stay. So likely DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**Plan:** Let\u2019s go UP to (7,6). Why?  \n- It\u2019s safe.  \n- It positions us to threaten from above if they go DOWN to (6,4).  \n- It keeps distance to avoid accidental head-on while tied length.  \n- It moves us toward apple at (7,7) for next turn! \ud83c\udf4e  \n- It doesn\u2019t trap us \u2014 we\u2019ll have options next turn.\n\nLEFT is tempting but too risky \u2014 could force head-on next turn accidentally. DOWN is passive. UP is aggressive toward apple and board control.\n\n**Next turn plan:** After UP to (7,6), if enemy goes DOWN to (6,4), we go UP again to (7,7) to eat apple and grow! If enemy goes LEFT to (5,5), we can maybe go LEFT to (6,6)? Wait (6,6) is enemy body \u2014 no. We\u2019ll reassess.\n\nChat, we\u2019re playing the LONG GAME \u2014 grow longer, then force them into a wall! Let\u2019s secure that apple at (7,7) next! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",
