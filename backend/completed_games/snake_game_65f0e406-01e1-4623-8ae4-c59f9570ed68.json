No, it's on the same level. Going upward might be better.\n- Moving LEFT or DOWN leads to walls or self-collision possibilities.\n\nKey point:\n- The apple at (2, 7) is directly above at (2, 7). Moving UP repeatedly to reach (2, 7) seems promising.\n- Alternatively, moving toward (8, 4) is possible but more distant; better to prioritize closer apples to build points.\n\nSince I am at (1, 2), I should:\n- First, move UP to (1, 3).\n- Then, keep moving UP to (1, 4), (1, 5), etc., approaching (2,7) which is slightly to the right and up.\n- Meanwhile, plan to eventually move RIGHT toward the (2, 7) apple.\n\nPotential hazards:\n- Enemy at (1, 5): If I move up three times, I will be at (1, 5), which is occupied by the enemy. I must avoid colliding with the enemy snake.\n\nConclusion:\n- Moving UP three times could collide with the enemy at (1, 5).\n- To avoid collision, I can try to go around or approach from a different angle.\n\nAlternative plan:\n- Instead of moving straight UP, perhaps moving RIGHT first to (2, 2), then moving upward and toward the apple at (2,7). But moving RIGHT now takes me to (2, 2), which is safe and closer to (2,7).\n\nSo, the plan:\n- First, move RIGHT from (1, 2) to (2, 2). Safe, away from the enemy.\n- Next moves can be upward to reach (2, 7).\n  \nIs moving RIGHT safe?\n- Yes, no walls or enemies there.\n- No apples immediately to the right, but progress toward the apple at (2,7).\n\nTherefore, the best initial move is to go RIGHT.\n\nNext turn, I will proceed upwards from (2, 2) toward the apple at (2,7).\n\nFinal decision:\nNext move: RIGHT.",

Risky, but quicker.\n\n**Enemy Snake:**\n- At (5,5) — below me. Only dangerous if I go down or it moves up and blocks me.\n\n---\n\n## Option Analysis\n\n1. **UP (5,7):**\n    - Safe.  \n    - Puts me closer to (8,7) (UP, then RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT).\n    -After going UP, choices open: LEFT is my body, DOWN is where enemy is (probably still), RIGHT is open, UP again is open.\n    - Safe and opens horizontal lanes toward right-side apples, while NOT crowding my own body.\n\n2. **RIGHT (6,6):**\n    - Safe. Closer to (6,9) (can go UP, UP, UP after this).\n    - If enemy moves UP (onto (5,6)) next turn, cut them off from coming into my column.\n\n3. **LEFT (4,6):**\n    - My own body — not allowed.\n\n4. **DOWN (5,5):**\n    - Enemy — instant death.\n\n**Between UP and RIGHT:**\n- Both are open, both keep enemy at bay.\n- Going UP allows more open board and flexibility next turn, keeps me away from the edge, and puts me on a path (with fewer turns) toward the right edge apples.\n- Going RIGHT keeps me near enemy, but could also open a quick UP path to the top if I wanted.\n\n**Potential Enemy Movement:**\n- Enemy at (5,5) can move: UP (5,6 - my current location, but it will only do so if I vacate), LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. If enemy is aggressive, I may want to pre-emptively avoid being boxed in by them.\n\n**Tail Consideration:**\n- My tail is at (3,6), will leave that square when I move; no self blockages ahead.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Decision**\n\nThe two safe moves are UP and RIGHT.\n\n- **UP (5,7):** Keeps me out of the enemy's vertical path, puts me higher on the board where more apples are present, and is fully open.\n- **RIGHT (6,6):** Also safe, but I may be moving closer to enemy potential path (if it moves UP/RIGHT).\n\n**Best Option:**  \n**UP** — I'm not boxed in here, enemy cannot block me next turn, and I keep plenty of options to pursue apples at (8,7) or (6,9).\n\n---\n\n#### **Next turn advice to self:**  \nLook for opportunity to \"zigzag\" rightwards above the enemy and toward apples, as safest path. Avoid being on same row/column as enemy. If the enemy moves up, adapt.\n\n---\n\n**MY MOVE:**\n**UP**",

Let's check:\n        - Not a wall (Y<10) ✅\n        - Not my own body ✅\n        - Not enemy ✅\n    - Leads higher, toward top row (safe for now).\n\n- **DOWN (5,6):**\n    - That's my own body ([5,6]). ❌\n\n- **LEFT (4,7):**\n    - Is (4,7) open?\n        - Not a wall ✅\n        - Not my own body? Let's check: body is [(5,6),(4,6)]. So (4,7) is clear.\n        - Not enemy ✅\n    - Valid, safe move. Leads toward left side, away from most apples.\n\n- **RIGHT (6,7):**\n    - Is (6,7) open?\n        - Not a wall (X<10) ✅\n        - Not my own body? [(5,6),(4,6)] — (6,7) is clear.\n        - Not enemy? (Enemy at (6,5)) — so clear.\n    - This moves toward nearby apple positions.\n\n**Assessing Proximity to Apples:**\n- (6,9): Currently two up and one right: (UP→UP→RIGHT).\n- (8,7): Two right from here (RIGHT→RIGHT).\n- (7,5): Down two and right two, but in enemy territory.\n- (8,4) and (6,1) are farther away.\n\n**Enemy Snake:**\n- At (6,5). Its likely safe move will be UP to (6,6), or RIGHT to (7,5) to try for the apple.\n- If it goes UP, it won’t be a threat yet, but if I move RIGHT repeatedly, I could intersect with it.\n\n**Latest move rationale:**\n- Both UP and RIGHT are safe and put me closer to apples.\n    - **UP** (5,8): Gets closer to top edge apple (6,9), then one RIGHT, one UP wins the apple. Also, being higher is generally safer (more exit routes).\n    - **RIGHT** (6,7): Gets closer to three apples ((6,9), (8,7), (7,5)), however, the enemy is on (6,5) and could move toward (6,6) soon, getting closer to me.\n\n**Optimal play:**\n- Prioritize safety and apple access. Favor avoiding getting too close to the enemy while maintaining the ability to change direction toward apples if opportunity arises.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n- Move UP to keep more choices open for apples (especially (6,9)), but remain flexible to pivot RIGHT next turn toward (8,7) or (6,9) as needed.\n- Reassess enemy snake's movement after this turn — if the enemy makes a play toward the same apples, ensure my path doesn't overlap.\n\n**My Move:**  \n**UP**\n\n---\n\n**Next-turn advice to self:**  \n- From (5,8), decide whether to go up again (chasing (6,9) or move right). If enemy is not close, consider RIGHT toward central apples. Watch for being cut off by enemy; keep escape routes open.\n\n---\n\n**Decided Move:**  \n**UP**",

For simplicity, let's assume our current head is at (7,5).\n\n- Enemy snake #1's head is at (5,8).\n\n- The board indicates apples at (6,9), (8,7), (8,4), (6,1), and (1,7).\n\n- Our last move was UP, which moved us to (7,6). Wait, the previous info states: \"Your snake is at (7,6) with body [(7,5)]\" indicating our head was at (7,5), then moved UP to (7,6). That confirms our latest position at (7,6). \n\n- Our body is at [(7,5)] (assuming length 2), so moving UP from (7,5) to (7,6) is safe.\n\n- Next, check the surroundings:\n\n  - Moving UP again to (7,7): Is that safe? (7,7) seems empty based on the board state; no apples, enemy, or body.\n\n  - Moving RIGHT to (8,6): Also empty, approaching apple at (8,7), which is one step above that.\n\n  - Moving DOWN to (7,5): back to previous position; not advisable.\n\n  - Moving LEFT to (6,6): also safe but less aligned with apples.\n\nGiven our goal to approach the apple at (8,7), moving RIGHT from (7,6) to (8,6) is promising, then moving UP to (8,7) next turn to eat the apple.\n\nHowever, from current position at (7,6), moving UP to (7,7) could be okay if it gets us closer to apples, but it's probably not as direct as moving RIGHT.\n\nBetween moving UP or RIGHT, moving RIGHT aligns better with target apple at (8,7). \n\nAlso, considering the enemy is at (5,8), moving towards the right and up won't immediately risk collision, given the current positions.

UP**  \n- Target would be (5,10): This is off the board (wall).  \n- **NOT ALLOWED.**\n\n**2. RIGHT**  \n- Target is (6,9).\n- This is in-bounds.\n- No body part there (mine: at (5,8), (5,7); enemy at (7,6), (7,5))\n- **Apple at (6,9)!**  \n- This is the apple that was nearby.\n- **GROWTH +1 expected after next turn.**\n- After this, possible next moves: UP (illegal), RIGHT (7,9), DOWN (6,8), LEFT (back to (5,9))\n- No immediate threat.\n\n**3. DOWN**  \n- Target is (5,8)\n- That's my own body (second segment)—illegal, self-collision.\n- **NOT ALLOWED**\n\n**4. LEFT**  \n- Target: (4,9)\n- In-bounds.\n- Not a body part.\n- But moving away from apples, less optimal.\n- May be used as a last-resort/escape option if other moves are blocked.\n\n---\n\n## **Assessing Choices**\n\n- **Priority is to score apples and maintain safe board presence.**\n- **RIGHT (6,9)** is the strongest option: immediate apple, no threat, grow.\n- After collecting apple at (6,9) (assuming apples don't change this turn), I'll be at (6,9) with body at [(5,9), (5,8)].\n    - Next opportunities:  \n        - RIGHT (7,9): open, then toward (8,7)  \n        - DOWN (6,8): back toward mid-row apples\n        - LEFT (illegal due to own tail, assuming I move right now and tail hasn't moved)\n    - No congestion; enemy is still low on the board.\n\n---\n\n## **Enemy Threats / Considerations**\n\n- Enemy's head (7,6) is two rows down, no immediate way to block my path.\n- Enemy cannot contest (6,9) this or next turn.\n- After apple at (6,9), nearest threat is along the upper-right: (8,7).\n- I can consider an aggressive line after this—continue RIGHT to pressure the next apple at (8,7).\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- Upon claiming (6,9), scan which apples remain.\n    - If (8,7) is not taken, plan RIGHT and DOWN (7,9) then either DOWN to (7,8) and (8,8)/(8,7).\n    - If new apples spawn, re-evaluate for nearest, safest apple, always checking that enemy's path doesn't block or trap me along the wall.\n- Always avoid narrow corridors, and keep an exit away from the enemy.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary—Decided Move**\n\n**Move:** RIGHT  \n**Reasoning:**  \n- Collect (6,9) apple for a guaranteed point.\n- Staying at top edge is safe; enables next push toward (8,7) apple if still present.\n- No enemy threat in immediate vicinity.\n\n**Next-turn Strategy:**  \nAfter eating apple, prioritize scanning for apples toward the right (8,7) unless more immediate/faster apples spawn. Avoid getting boxed in along the upper wall—maintain at least two possible exits. Watch enemy movement in case they start moving up/right.\n\n---\n\n### **DECIDED NEXT MOVE:**  \n**RIGHT**",

UP**  \n- (6,10): Off the board (illegal).\n\n**2. RIGHT**  \n- (7,9): In bounds.\n- Is it safe? Let's check: no snake bodies at (7,9), nor apples.\n- This would get me closer to (8,7) by first going right, then down.\n\n**3. DOWN**  \n- (6,8): In bounds.\n- Is it safe? Let's check: is (6,8) in my own body?\n    - My body is [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7)]: No, so safe.\n- Taking this path would head me downward, could prepare for a quick route to (8,7) by going across at (6,8) → (7,8) → (8,7).\n- But going directly right is fastest toward (8,7).\n\n**4. LEFT**  \n- (5,9): This is occupied by my own body segment (just moved from here). Self-collision.\n- Not allowed.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategic Assessment**\n\n### **Target Apple: (8,7)**\n- The most natural next target is (8,7).\n- Closest apples from my current position:\n    - (8,7): distance = |8-6| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4\n    - (1,7): = |1-6| + |7-9| = 5 + 2 = 7\n    - (8,4): = |8-6| + |4-9| = 2 + 5 = 7\n    - (6,1): = |6-6| + |1-9| = 0 + 8 = 8\n    - (1,3): = |1-6| + |3-9| = 5 + 6 = 11\n    - So (8,7) is the closest by far.\n\n- The fastest path is:\n    - RIGHT to (7,9), then DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7).\n    - Alternatively, RIGHT → RIGHT → DOWN, but that's right against the edge.\n\n- No direct enemy threat: enemy head is at (8,6), and likely needs one move UP to challenge for (8,7), but I'm closer to (8,7) via the top row.\n\n### **Safety Check**\n- No enemy or body segment risks in the immediate vicinity.\n- Tail is moving: after my RIGHT move, my new tail should be at (5,8).\n\n---\n\n## **Move Assessment**\n\n1. **RIGHT** to (7,9): In bounds, safe, best path toward (8,7).\n2. **DOWN** to (6,8): Also safe, but takes me away from the direct beeline to (8,7).\n\nIf I go DOWN pre-emptively, it slows my route (I’ll then need to zigzag right). So, unless the board gets crowded or the enemy races to (8,7), RIGHT is optimal.\n\n---\n\n## **Enemy Predict**\n- Enemy is at (8,6), with body at (7,6).\n- They could go UP to (8,7), but only after a turn or two, as they're not directly adjacent; moving UP from (8,6) would bring them to (8,7).\n- If they do, I’d be one turn behind them if I don't hurry.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Plan**\n- If (8,7) remains not taken, continue RIGHT → (7,9), then next move DOWN or RIGHT if possible.\n- If enemy moves quickly toward (8,7), reassess route or go for alternative apples or position defensively.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Decision**\n\n**Move:** RIGHT  \n**Reasoning:**  \n- Direct, safe route toward the next apple at (8,7).\n- No immediate threats nearby.\n- Maintains maximal flexibility for next moves.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:** \n- If at (7,9), consider going DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) for the apple, unless enemy gets there first. Always verify safety and keep at least one escape route.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move:**  \n**RIGHT**",

My new location is (7,9), my body is now [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8)] (tail at (5,8) will move forward next turn).\n\n---\n\n## **Board State – Nearby Threats**\n\nLooking at the partial board, plus enemy snake:\n- I am at (7,9); right of me is (8,9) (open), down is (7,8) (open), up is (7,10) (off board), left is (6,9) (my own body).\n- Closest apple in my direct path: (1,8) is in my row, but far left.\n- The previously-planned (8,7) apple is now NOT in the list—was it just eaten by the enemy? YES, \"Apples at:\" list shows (8,4), (6,1), (1,7), (1,3), (1,8).\n  - Therefore, enemy snake #0 just ate (8,7), and their head is at (8,7).\n  - Which means (8,9) is directly above their head, and (7,8) is 1 square to my south and not threatened.\n\n---\n\n## **Possible Moves from (7,9)**\n\nLet's consider and check safety:\n\n### 1. UP\n- (7,10): Off board → ILLEGAL.\n\n### 2. RIGHT\n- (8,9): In bounds.\n- Is it safe? Let's check: \n    - No enemy snakes or bodies at (8,9)—enemy is at (8,7). (8,9) is above (8,7), but enemy can't get there next turn except by moving up.\n    - Is there an apple? No.\n    - Is it useful? It moves me east toward (8,4), but that apple is much farther.\n    - Is it a safe area? Yes.\n\n### 3. DOWN\n- (7,8): In bounds.\n- Is it safe? Let's check:\n    - Any bodies? No—my body is (6,9), (5,9), (5,8).\n    - Any threat from enemy? (8,7) is two away; they can only move UP to (8,8) or stay lower.\n    - Any apples? At (1,8)—far left.\n    - Strategic value: Moves toward the center, leaving flexibility.\n\n### 4. LEFT\n- (6,9): Occupied by my own body. ILLEGAL (self-collision).\n\n---\n\n## **Route to Next Apples**\n\nLet's find the distances:\n\n**Apples at:**\n- (8,4): |8-7| + |4-9| = 1 + 5 = 6\n- (6,1): |6-7| + |1-9| = 1 + 8 = 9\n- (1,7): |1-7| + |7-9| = 6 + 2 = 8\n- (1,3): |1-7| + |3-9| = 6 + 6 = 12\n- (1,8): |1-7| + |8-9| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n**Closest is (8,4) (6 away), then (1,8) (7 away), (1,7) (8 away).**\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,9), then will need to go DOWN multiple times to approach (8,4).\nIf I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), DOWN to (8,7)—but enemy is also in that region.\n\n---\n\n## **Enemy Snake Movements**\nEnemy is at (8,7), with body at [(8,6), (7,6)].\n- Next move likely UP to (8,8) or RIGHT (if allowed). \n- But I am at (7,9), so if I go DOWN I am potentially closer to intercepting their space if needed later.\n- But no apples there anymore; our paths *diverge* now.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategic Decision**\n\n**What is the highest value action?**\n- I want to avoid corners to keep flexibility.\n- (8,9) keeps me on the top edge, pushing me right; from (8,9) I can go DOWN next turn if I want, opening new routes.\n- (7,8) brings me off the edge and keeps more options. Slightly more centrally located, more escape routes.\n\n**But which route is best to (8,4), the closest apple?**\n\n- If I go RIGHT: (8,9) → (8,8) → (8,7) → (8,6) → (8,5) → (8,4) (but may run into enemy, who is in that vertical)\n- If I go DOWN: (7,8) → (8,8) → (8,7) etc.; similar problem.\n\n- But I get to (8,8) from either route, but going RIGHT first puts me immediately above the enemy's current Y-row, possibly more dangerous.\n- If enemy decides to go UP from (8,7) to (8,8), they could block me at (8,8) if I also go that way. Less likely if I go DOWN: more time to react and see what they do. \n\n**Is there a way the enemy can cut me off?**\n- If enemy goes UP to (8,8), they could force me to run away or wait.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion and Move**\n\n- **Priority:** Stay central, maximize options. Don't head directly into enemy path just for the sake of proximity to apple.\n- **DOWN** to (7,8) gives me options: from there I can go RIGHT (8,8) or continue DOWN or LEFT if need be based on enemy moves.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,9) is also safe, but leaves me in the corner, less flexibility, and potentially forced to go DOWN toward enemy vertical.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- From (7,8), observe enemy's move. If enemy goes UP to (8,8), consider switching to alternate apples (center/left) or take a downward route to avoid head-on clash.\n- If path toward (8,4) is free, continue toward it judiciously, otherwise pivot for (1,8) or (1,7).\n\n---\n\n## **Decided Next Move:**\n**DOWN**\n\n---\n\n**Next turn, reassess based on enemy snake's position and path to (8,4). Consider switching targets or circling if enemy blocks path.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Move:**  \n**DOWN**",

Is it safe?\n    - My body is at (7,9), (6,9), (5,9) — (7,7) is clear.\n    - Enemy: (8,8) and (8,7) (but not at (7,7))\n    - Apple at (1,7), so going left after down may set up for that.\n3. **LEFT** → (6,8):\n    - In bounds.\n    - Is it safe? Yes, no snake bodies there.\n    - Apple at (1,8), potentially reachable if traversing left along row 8.\n4. **RIGHT** → (8,8):\n    - In bounds.\n    - Enemy snake HEAD is at (8,8) right now!\n    - **Going right would cause an immediate head-to-head collision – game over. ILLEGAL/unsafe.**\n\n**So, only safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.**\n\n---\n\n### Enemy Snake Threat\n\n- The enemy's head is (8,8) next to me. They cannot go left into me directly (since you move simultaneously), but if I go right, a head-on collision occurs — we both die or both lose.\n- Enemy's likely next moves: can go DOWN to (8,7), UP (if allowed, but (8,9) is open), LEFT (direct head-on), or stay in place. \n- Their body is below (8,8) at (8,7), so up/right are open for them, as well as left if they want to engage.\n\n---\n\n### Strategic Aims\n\n- (8,4) is the closest apple, but moving directly toward it puts me on a collision path with the enemy, which is risky.\n- A safer path is to avoid immediate proximity to the enemy and angle toward less contested apples or circle so I can react next turn.\n\n**LEFT to (6,8):**  \n- Moves me away from the enemy, toward an open field.\n- Also sets up potential for a leftward traverse for (1,8) (6 moves left), or can go DOWN next turn.\n\n**DOWN to (7,7):**\n- Keeps me closer to the enemy's vertical, although not an immediate threat.\n\nLet's check which one gives more options:\n\n- From (6,8): my next moves can be DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8), or RIGHT (7,8, my last position).\n- From (7,7): my next moves can be DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), or RIGHT (8,7, enemy's body).\n\n**DOWN (7,7)** is slightly risky: (8,7) is occupied by the enemy's body, so going right after going down is blocked, meaning just LEFT or DOWN as continued safe moves. Also, enemy could potentially come down closer if they go DOWN.\n\n**LEFT (6,8)** gives maximum escape flexibility and spaces me away from the enemy.\n\n---\n\n## PLAN\n\n**Move LEFT to (6,8), stay away from enemy snake, and start moving toward either (1,8) for a safe apple, or stay flexible based on enemy movement.**\n\nIf enemy pivots away or clears the area, I can re-route toward (8,4) next turn if desired, but survival and flexibility matter most now.\n\n---\n\n### Next Turn Strategy\n\n- If enemy pursues the apples lower (toward (8,4)), consider a left traverse aiming for (1,8) or (1,7).\n- If enemy comes my way, continue left, perhaps then down, avoiding direct confrontations.\n\n---\n\n**Decided Next Move:**  \n**LEFT**",

Moving directly down is possible but risky due to potential collisions along the way.\n- The other apples are at (6, 1), (1, 7), (1, 3), and (1, 8). The apple at (8, 7) is directly ahead, since from current position (8, 9), moving DOWN would get us closer to the apple at (8, 7).\n- However, the apple at (8,7) is just one move away if we go DOWN, but the position (8,7) is occupied by our own body (since our body is [(8,8),(8,7)]), so moving DOWN now would lead to a collision with ourselves.\n- Also, the apple at (8,7) is at our immediate body segment, meaning moving onto it would cause growth, but since it is part of our current body, moving onto it would be bad—probably an invalid move or resulting in death.\n- Given that, perhaps the best move is to continue towards the apple at (8, 4), which involves moving down several steps, but we must avoid the snake colliding with walls or other snakes.\n\nChecking possibilities:\n\n- Moving LEFT (from (8,9) to (7,9)): This moves us away from the immediate target and may lengthen the path to apples on the right side.\n- Moving RIGHT (from (8,9) to (9,9)): This is within bounds and not occupied, but not helpful for current goal.\n- Moving DOWN (from (8,9) to (8,8)): That would collide with our own body at (8,8), which is part of our current body segment. Not safe.\n- Moving UP again would move further upward, away from apples.\n\nThe next closest apple in terms of safety is at (6,1). To reach it, we need to plan a longer route, avoiding the enemy snake at (6,8).\n\nGiven the current situation, the key is to avoid immediate danger:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (7,9) seems safe and maintains a good position.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,9) is also safe, but that leads us away from immediate apples.\n- Moving DOWN is dangerous due to potential collision with ourselves or the environment.\n- Moving UP is unsafe, as we're already at the top boundary or near it.\n\nSince the goal is to approach the closest accessible apple safely and the direct path to apples downward is blocked by our own body or not immediately safe, perhaps shifting left is the best option to head towards the left-side apples, like at (1,8).\n\nAlternatively, considering the current positions, moving LEFT to (7,9) seems safe and could set us up to navigate towards apples on the left in subsequent moves.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n- Moving LEFT is safe if no obstacle is there.\n- Moving LEFT from (8,9) to (7,9): within bounds, no snake segment there.\n- Next, we can maneuver downward or leftward to reach the apples at (1,8), (1,7), etc.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n- Prioritize safety now.\n- Avoid moving closer to enemy snakes or walls recklessly.\n- Plan a route towards apples on the left and downward.\n\n**Decided move:** LEFT",

No. **Safe!**\n4. **RIGHT** to (7,8):\n    - Is (7,8) occupied? Yes, my previous head/body. **Not safe.**\n\n**So only safe moves are DOWN and LEFT.**\n\n---\n\n### **CONSIDERING ENEMY SNAKE**\n\n- The enemy's **new head** is at (8,9).\n- Their body is at (8,8) and (8,7).\n- Both snakes are no longer adjacent.\n- Immediate threat: minimal, provided I avoid letting them flank/cut me off.\n\n---\n\n### **APPLE STRATEGY**\n\n- The **apple at (1,8)** is the closest. If I go LEFT along row 8, I can start moving toward that.\n- **DOWN** to (6,7) could set me up to go LEFT further, but it also puts me closer to the bottom apples should I want to pivot.\n\n**Which direction keeps me most flexible and safe?**\n\n#### If I go LEFT to (5,8):\n- Next turn, I could:\n    - Continue LEFT to (4,8), drawing closer to (1,8).\n    - Go DOWN to (5,7), opening a path toward (1,7) as well.\n\n#### If I go DOWN to (6,7):\n- Next turn, options:\n    - Continue DOWN to (6,6).\n    - Go LEFT to (5,7), again working toward the apples at x=1 but one row lower.\n\n- However, going DOWN puts a little more distance between my head and the apple at (1,8).\n\n---\n\n### **POSITIONAL & SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS**\n\n- **LEFT** (to (5,8)):\n    - Stays along row 8, leading directly in line with (1,8), an uncontested apple.\n    - No threats there—fully open space.\n    - Also keeps me away from the enemy (who is mostly north/east of me).\n    - Easiest path to the apple.\n\n- **DOWN** (to (6,7)):\n    - Also safe; lets me pivot toward (1,7) or further left along row 7.\n    - But (1,8) is closer and more direct via the top row.\n\nGiven both moves are safe, **LEFT** is more direct toward an apple and offers clear escape options, much like last turn. It keeps my snake away from the enemy and in wide open space.\n\n---\n\n### **STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN**\n\n- Continue trucking LEFT toward (1,8). If for some reason the apple is taken, I can adjust downward for (1,7) or re-route.\n- Keep an eye on enemy movements. If they suddenly change direction toward me, be ready to cut down or juke.\n\n---\n\n## **DECIDED NEXT MOVE: LEFT**\n\n**Summary:**  \nI will move LEFT from (6,8) to (5,8), continuing safely toward the apple at (1,8) and staying as far as possible from the other snake.\n\n**Next move:**  \n**LEFT**",

If for some reason the apple is taken, I can adjust downward for (1,7) or re-route.\n- Keep an eye on enemy movements. If they suddenly change direction toward me, be ready to cut down or juke.\n\n---\n\n## **DECIDED NEXT MOVE: LEFT**\n\n**Summary:**  \nI will move LEFT from (6,8) to (5,8), continuing safely toward the apple at (1,8) and staying as far as possible from the other snake.\n\n**Next move:**  \n**LEFT**",
