While staying central (by moving UP) might seem appealing, grabbing the apple has its benefits. By moving LEFT, we\u2019d immediately gain an extra point and grow longer\u2014which is good for scoring. Checking (0,1) after a LEFT move shows that while we\u2019d be closer to the board\u2019s left edge, our possible next moves (UP to (0,2) or DOWN to (0,0)) remain safe.\n\nTherefore, despite the slight risk of being near the edge, the apple\u2019s extra point and growth advantage make LEFT the best move.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

In subsequent moves, we can proceed downward from the far right column:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For example, after (9,3) we could move DOWN to (9,2) and then DOWN to (9,1) to grab that apple.\n\nThere is no immediate threat from the enemy snake (whose head is at (7,7)) and none of our future steps (by going RIGHT now) appear to run into danger.\n\nThus, the best, most direct path is to move RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
