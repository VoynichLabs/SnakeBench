Board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, check all four moves from (5,0):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5,1) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,-1) \u274c Off the board, DEAD.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,0) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,0) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n\nSo DOWN is out. Now, think about the enemy. He's at (7,9). He can move DOWN to (7,8), LEFT to (6,9), RIGHT to (8,9), UP off board? Wait, UP from (7,9) is (7,10) \u2192 off board, so he won't do that. So his safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWe want to **avoid head-on collision** this early when scores are equal. Where could he go? He's far away, so no immediate collision risk unless we both move into same cell from far? Not possible this turn.\n\nBut we also want to **set up aggression**. We need to grow, control space, and eventually trap him. Look at apples: closest apple to us is at (6,2), (7,0), (1,1), etc. (7,0) is close but moving RIGHT to (6,0) doesn't get us closer to (7,0) yet\u2014actually, from (6,0), next turn we could go RIGHT to (7,0) to eat it. That's good.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,0), we're moving away from most apples except maybe (3,5) way up.\n\nIf we go UP to (5,1), we're central, more options next turn.\n\nBut thinking long-term: we want to **cut off enemy's movement** eventually. He's top-right, we're bottom-left. We should move toward center to control board.\n\nCheck safe follow-up moves from each:\n\n- From (5,1): UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT all likely safe next turn unless enemy moves into them (unlikely).\n- From (6,0): UP/DOWN/RIGHT/LEFT? LEFT back to (5,0) is safe (empty now). Actually from (6,0), UP to (6,1) safe, RIGHT to (7,0) has apple, DOWN off board, LEFT to (5,0) safe. So 3 safe moves next turn.\n- From (4,0): UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT? RIGHT to (5,0) safe, UP to (4,1) safe, LEFT to (3,0) safe, DOWN off board. Also 3 safe moves.\n\nSo all three options have good future mobility.\n\nBut chat, think about **psychological warfare** \ud83d\ude08 Moving RIGHT to (6,0) sets up eating (7,0) apple next turn, gets us first growth, puts us closer to enemy's side? Actually enemy is top, we're bottom. Hmm.\n\nI think best play is **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,0). Gets us closer to apple, keeps options open, starts pressuring right side of board.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (7,0) apple next turn, consider moving up toward (7,3) or (8,3) apples while watching enemy's movement. Try to get between enemy and center to limit his expansion.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples everywhere, but we're playing the ENEMY, not the fruit! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nFirst, check our four moves from (6,0):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,1) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,-1) \u274c Off the board, DEAD.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,0) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,0) \u2705 Has an apple! Eating means we grow to length 2 next turn.\n\nSo DOWN is instantly out. Now, consider the enemy's possible moves from (6,9):\nHe can go UP? (6,10) off board \u274c. DOWN to (6,8) \u2705. LEFT to (5,9) \u2705 (has apple there!). RIGHT to (7,9) \u2705.\n\nWe need to think about SIMULTANEOUS movement. Could we have a head-on collision? If we go RIGHT to (7,0) and he goes... nowhere near us, no risk. If we go UP to (6,1) and he goes DOWN to (6,8), no issue. Left to (5,0) and he goes LEFT to (5,9)? Different rows, fine.\n\nBut chat, think AGGRESSION! \ud83d\ude08 If we eat the apple at (7,0), we grow. That gives us a longer body next turn, which can be used to block the enemy later. Also, score becomes 1-0, giving us the head-on collision advantage if we ever meet heads.\n\nWhat about future mobility? Let's evaluate:\n\n- **RIGHT (to (7,0), eat apple)**: Next turn, our body will be at [(7,0), (6,0)]. From head at (7,0), we can go UP to (7,1), LEFT to (6,0) (our own body! \u274c), RIGHT to (8,0), DOWN off board. So only UP and RIGHT would be safe next turn. That's only 2 options\u2014risky! Could get trapped.\n\n- **UP (to (6,1))**: Next turn, body at [(6,1), (6,0)]. From (6,1), we can go UP to (6,2) (apple there!), LEFT to (5,1), RIGHT to (7,1), DOWN to (6,0) (our body \u274c). So 3 safe moves, and we move toward apple at (6,2). Better future options.\n\n- **LEFT (to (5,0))**: Next turn, body at [(5,0), (6,0)]. From (5,0), we can go UP to (5,1), LEFT to (4,0), RIGHT to (6,0) (body \u274c), DOWN off board. So 2 safe moves. Less flexible.\n\nSo UP gives us 3 safe follow-ups, RIGHT gives us 2 but gets us a point now, LEFT gives 2.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to control the board. Enemy is top, we're bottom. Moving UP starts claiming the center column. Eating the apple at (6,2) soon could be huge. We can then maybe cut off enemy's descent down the middle.\n\nAlso, if enemy eats the apple at (5,9) by going LEFT, he'll grow too. But we can outmaneuver him if we keep our options open.\n\nSAFETY FIRST, AGGRESSION SECOND! Going UP keeps us alive with more futures, and we can still get apples next turn. Going RIGHT risks being cornered bottom-right with fewer exits.\n\nChat, I'm feeling UP! Let's take the center, keep our momentum, and set up for a dominant mid-game! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Gotta close that gap!\n\nFirst, check our moves from (6,1):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,2) \u2705 Empty? Board shows (6,2) has an 'A'? Wait, checking... board says (6,2) is an apple! Yes, apple at (6,2). So UP is safe and gets us an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,0) \u274c That's our own body! DEAD.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,1) \u2705 Empty.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,1) \u2705 Empty.\n\nSo DOWN is out. Now, enemy's possible moves from (5,9):\nHe can go UP to (5,10) \u274c off board.\nDOWN to (5,8) \u2705 empty.\nLEFT to (4,9) \u2705 empty.\nRIGHT to (6,9) \u274c That's his own body! So RIGHT is invalid for him.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: DOWN or LEFT.\n\nHead-on collision risk? If we go UP to (6,2) and he goes... nowhere near. If we go LEFT to (5,1) and he goes DOWN to (5,8) or LEFT to (4,9), no collision. If we go RIGHT to (7,1), same.\n\nBut chat, AGGRESSION MODE! \ud83d\udc0d We need that apple to tie the score! If we eat (6,2), we grow to length 3 next turn (head + 2 body segments). That gives us more blocking power. Also, being at (6,2) puts us closer to center, controlling column 6.\n\nFuture mobility after each move:\n\n- **UP (to (6,2), eat apple)**: Next turn body: [(6,2), (6,1), (6,0)]. From (6,2), we can go UP to (6,3) (apple!), LEFT to (5,2), RIGHT to (7,2) (apple!), DOWN to (6,1) (body \u274c). So 3 safe moves, two toward apples. Strong!\n\n- **LEFT (to (5,1))**: Next turn body: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,0)]. From (5,1), moves: UP to (5,2), LEFT to (4,1), RIGHT to (6,1) (body \u274c), DOWN to (5,0). That's 3 safe moves too. But no immediate apple.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (7,1))**: Next turn body: [(7,1), (6,1), (6,0)]. From (7,1), moves: UP to (7,2) (apple!), LEFT to (6,1) (body \u274c), RIGHT to (8,1), DOWN to (7,0) (apple!). That's 3 safe moves, two toward apples also.\n\nSo all three safe moves give 3 follow-ups. But UP gets the apple NOW, tying score 1-1. That's crucial for head-on collision rules\u2014if we meet heads later with equal length, we both die. But if we're longer, we survive. So growing is key!\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (6,2), aim to control the middle. Enemy is top-left-ish. We can maybe push upward, force him toward edges. Next turn from (6,2), consider going UP to (6,3) for another apple, or RIGHT to (7,2) to claim more space. Keep an eye on his possible path down column 5 or 4.\n\nSAFETY CHECK: No immediate collision risk. Enemy likely moves DOWN or LEFT away from us. We're clear.\n\nChat, the move is obvious\u2014TAKE THE APPLE, TIE THE SCORE, AND PUSH FOR DOMINANCE! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

We gotta press the advantage!\n\nFirst, check our moves from (6,2):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,3) \u2705 That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Board shows (6,3) is 'A'.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,1) \u274c That's our own body!

LEFT is safe but no immediate apple.\n\nNow, enemy's possible moves from (5,8):\nHe can go UP to (5,9) \u274c That's his own body!\nDOWN to (5,7) \u2705 Empty.\nLEFT to (4,8) \u2705 Empty (wait, board shows (4,8) is 'A'? Actually apple at (4,8) is listed, but that's just an apple, not a snake\u2014so it's safe for him to move onto).\nRIGHT to (6,8) \u2705 Empty.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nHead-on collision risk THIS TURN? Let's check:\n\nIf we go UP to (6,3), could he move into (6,3)? He'd need to come from (6,2) or (5,3) or (7,3) or (6,4). He's at (5,8)\u2014impossible. So safe.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,2), could he move into (7,2)? He'd need to come from (7,1), (6,2), (8,2), or (7,3). None possible from his position. Safe.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5,2), could he move into (5,2)? He's too far. Safe.\n\nSo all three safe moves avoid immediate head-on.\n\nBut chat, AGGRESSION MODE! \ud83d\udc0d We want to grow AND cut off his space! He's up in the top-left area. If we go UP to (6,3), we claim more center-top control. If we go RIGHT to (7,2), we push toward the right side apples.\n\nFuture mobility check:\n\n- **UP to (6,3) + eat apple**: Next turn body: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0)]. From (6,3), moves: UP to (6,4) (empty), LEFT to (5,3) (empty), RIGHT to (7,3) (apple!), DOWN to (6,2) (body \u274c). That's 3 safe moves, one toward apple.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,2) + eat apple**: Next turn body: [(7,2), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0)]. From (7,2), moves: UP to (7,3) (apple!), LEFT to (6,2) (body \u274c), RIGHT to (8,2) (empty), DOWN to (7,1) (empty). That's 3 safe moves, one toward apple.\n\n- **LEFT to (5,2)**: Next turn body: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0)]. From (5,2), moves: UP to (5,3) (empty), LEFT to (4,2) (empty), RIGHT to (6,2) (body \u274c), DOWN to (5,1) (empty). That's 3 safe moves, no immediate apple.\n\nAll give 3 follow-ups, but UP and RIGHT grow us NOW. Growing is key for head-on dominance!\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, we'll be length 4 vs his length 2. We can start boxing him toward the top edge. He's at (5,8); if he goes DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, we can try to maneuver to cut off his escape routes. Next turn, consider moving toward (7,3) or (6,4) to expand our wall. Keep our body as a barrier along column 6.\n\nChat, I'm leaning UP\u2014it keeps us more central and sets up to threaten his area from below. But RIGHT also strong... Wait, UP gets us closer to where he might move down? Actually, he's at y=8, we'd be at y=3. Not directly blocking yet.\n\nBut think: If we go UP, we're near apples at (6,3), (7,3), (8,3). That's a cluster! We can chain eats! RIGHT also near apple cluster at (7,2), (7,3), (8,3)... Hmm.\n\nSAFETY CHECK: No immediate threats. Enemy likely moves DOWN to (5,7) or LEFT to (4,8) for apple. We're clear.\n\nVIBE CHECK: We're tied, we need to pull ahead! Let's take the apple at (6,3) and push upward to control that column! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** We're length 4, he's length 2. Use our body to wall off column 6. Consider moving to (6,4) or (7,3) to continue growing and pressure him from below. Watch if he moves toward apples at (4,8) or (3,8). We can slowly expand toward top-left.\n\nUP",

DEAD.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,3) \u2705 Empty.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,3) \u2705 That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Board shows (7,3) is 'A'.\n\nSo DOWN is out. RIGHT gets us an apple and grows to length 5! UP and LEFT are safe but no immediate apple.\n\nNow, enemy's possible moves from (4,8):\nHe can go UP to (4,9) \u2705 Empty.\nDOWN to (4,7) \u2705 Empty.\nLEFT to (3,8) \u2705 That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\nRIGHT to (5,8) \u274c That's his own body!\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. He'll likely go for the apple at (3,8) or (4,9) maybe.\n\nHead-on collision risk THIS TURN? Let's check:\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,3), could he move into (7,3)? He'd need to come from (7,2), (6,3), (8,3), or (7,4). He's at (4,8)\u2014impossible. Safe.\n\nIf we go UP to (6,4), could he move into (6,4)? Impossible. Safe.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5,3), could he move into (5,3)? Impossible. Safe.\n\nSo all three safe moves avoid immediate head-on.\n\nBut chat, AGGRESSION MODE! \ud83d\udc0d We have length 4 vs his 3! We want to grow AND start boxing him! He's up in the top-left corner. If we go RIGHT to (7,3) and eat that apple, we become length 5, making our body a longer wall along column 6 and row 3 area. That starts cutting the board!\n\nFuture mobility check:\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,3) + eat apple**: Next turn body: [(7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0)]. From (7,3), moves: UP to (7,4) (empty), LEFT to (6,3) (body \u274c), RIGHT to (8,3) (apple!), DOWN to (7,2) (apple!). That's 3 safe moves, TWO toward apples! That's HUGE for chaining growth!\n\n- **UP to (6,4)**: Next turn body: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0)]. From (6,4), moves: UP to (6,5) (empty), LEFT to (5,4) (empty), RIGHT to (7,4) (empty), DOWN to (6,3) (body \u274c). That's 3 safe moves, but no immediate apples nearby. Slower growth.\n\n- **LEFT to (5,3)**: Next turn body: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0)]. From (5,3), moves: UP to (5,4) (empty), LEFT to (4,3) (empty), RIGHT to (6,3) (body \u274c), DOWN to (5,2) (empty). That's 3 safe moves, no apples.\n\nRIGHT gives us the best future options AND grows us NOW! With length 5 vs his 3, we can start threatening head-on collisions more aggressively\u2014if we meet head-on, WE WIN because longer snake survives!\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (7,3), next turn we can go to (8,3) for another apple, or (7,2) for another apple, continuing to grow rapidly. Our long body along column 6 will act as a barrier. Enemy is in top-left; we can expand rightward and upward, eventually cutting off his escape downward. Watch if he moves toward (3,8) apple\u2014that might keep him up there. We want to slowly advance toward him while growing uncontrollably!\n\nSAFETY CHECK: No immediate threats. Enemy likely goes for apple at (3,8) or moves down to (4,7). We're clear.\n\nVIBE CHECK: We're tied in score but longer! Let's PULL AHEAD with this apple at (7,3) and start DOMINATING the right side! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** We're length 5, he's length 3. Use body as wall. Consider moving to (8,3) or (7,2) for apples to chain growth. Start moving upward toward enemy's area while keeping escape routes. If he comes down, we can try to force head-on with our length advantage.\n\nRIGHT",

(His body segment at (3,8))\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN? Could he move into our chosen cell?\n- If we go UP to (8,4): He'd need to be at (8,3), (7,4), (9,4), or (8,5). He's at (2,8)\u2014impossible. Safe.\n- If we go DOWN to (8,2): He'd need to be at (8,1), (7,2), (9,2), or (8,3). Impossible. Safe.\n- If we go RIGHT to (9,3): He'd need to be at (9,2), (8,3), (9,4), or (10,3). Impossible. Safe.\n\nALL SAFE FROM IMMEDIATE HEAD-ON.\n\nFUTURE MOBILITY CHECK (NEXT TURN OPTIONS):\n\n**A) UP to (8,4):**\n- Body becomes: [(8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)] length 6.\n- From (8,4), next turn moves:\n  - UP to (8,5): Empty? Row 5: \". A . A . . . . . A\" so (8,5) = empty.\n  - DOWN to (8,3): \u274c OUR BODY!\n  - LEFT to (7,4): Empty? Row 4: \". . . . A . . . .

Good options.\n\n**B) DOWN to (8,2):**\n- Body: [(8,2), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)] length 6.\n- From (8,2), next turn moves:\n  - UP to (8,3): \u274c BODY\n  - DOWN to (8,1): Empty? Row 1: \". A . . . . T . . .\" so (8,1) = empty.\n  - LEFT to (7,2): APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (7,2) is 'A' (from apple list, still there? Yes, not eaten yet!)\n  - RIGHT to (9,2): Empty? Row 2: \".

That's risky\u2014we could get trapped next turn if we eat the apple and have only one exit! \ud83d\ude2c\n\nRIGHT move looks dangerous for future mobility! We'd be stuck on the right edge with limited options.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY: We want to box enemy in top-left! He's at (2,8). We're on right side. We should move UP to (8,4) to start advancing toward top rows, keeping central control. Down is okay but moves us away from enemy. Right is risky edge play.\n\nAGGRESSION MODE: With length advantage, we want to threaten head-on collisions if he comes toward us. Moving UP positions us better to cut off his escape downward later.\n\nCHAT, VIBE CHECK: UP gives us 3 safe moves next turn, including a potential apple at (9,4) if we want it. DOWN also gives 3 safe moves and apple at (7,2). But UP advances our position toward enemy territory! We're playing to WIN, not just survive! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** We're length 6 vs his 4. After moving UP to (8,4), consider moving LEFT to (7,4) or UP to (8,5) to continue advancing toward top rows. Avoid getting pinned on edges. Use body as wall along row 3 and column 6. If enemy moves down toward us, we can force head-on with our length advantage. Watch his head position next turn!\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- If we go RIGHT to (9,5): He'd need to be at (9,4), (8,5), (9,6), or (10,5). Impossible.

Row 4: \". . . . A . . . . A\" so (9,4) = 'A'? Wait, apple was at (9,4) but we ate it last turn? Actually, apple list shows (9,4) was an apple, but board shows 'A' at (9,4) in row 4? Let's check board row 4 string: \". . . . A . . . . A\" \u2014 col9 = 'A', yes apple there. But if we move to (9,5) now, next turn (9,4) is empty? No, (9,4) is still an apple unless someone eats it. But our body will be at (8,5) and (9,5), so (9,4) is free? Actually, careful: After eating apple at (9,5), our body grows, so tail stays. So (9,4) is not our body. It might still be apple. But let's check apple list: (9,4) is in the list. So (9,4) is an apple. So from (9,5):\n  - DOWN to (9,4): APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n  - LEFT to (8,5): \u274c OUR BODY!\n  - RIGHT to (10,5): \u274c OFF BOARD!\nSo only 2 safe moves, one is an apple. But we're on the edge again\u2014risky! If we go DOWN to (9,4) next turn, we'd be at (9,4) with only LEFT (8,4 body?) and UP (9,5 body?) options? Actually, after that, our body would be [(9,4), (9,5), (8,5), ...] so from (9,4), UP to (9,5) is body, LEFT to (8,4) is body? (8,4) is our body segment. So only DOWN to (9,3) maybe? That's a potential trap! Edge is dangerous.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY: We want to grow and dominate. UP to (8,6) eats an apple, grows to 6, and gives us 3 safe moves next turn\u2014keeping options open. LEFT to (7,5) doesn't grow, but keeps us flexible. RIGHT is greedy but pins us on the edge.\n\nAGGRESSION MODE: With length advantage, we want to grow faster! UP gives us an apple now and positions us near top-right to potentially cut off enemy's space. Enemy is far left, we can feast and expand our territory! \ud83d\ude80\n\nCHAT, VIBE CHECK: UP is the PLAY! It grows us, keeps future mobility high, and avoids the edge trap. LEFT is safe but no growth. RIGHT is risky edge play. We're playing to WIN, not to survive on the edge! Let's advance and GROW! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** After moving UP to (8,6), we'll have length 6 vs enemy 4. Consider moving towards center or cutting off enemy's path from the top. Watch if enemy goes for apple at (0,7)\u2014if he does, he grows to 4, still behind us. Use our body to wall off the top-right corner and slowly push enemy toward the top-left edge. Keep length advantage and force head-on if he dares approach!\n\nUP",

Enemy is on left side. Moving LEFT to (7,6) brings us closer to center and maybe towards the enemy to apply pressure. UP moves us toward top edge, which could be used to wall off the top later. But we need to think about apples too\u2014apple at (9,5) is reachable in two turns if we go RIGHT now, but that's risky.\n\nCHAT, VIBE CHECK: LEFT is the SMART PLAY! It keeps us central, maintains 3 safe moves next turn, and avoids edge traps. UP is also safe but moves us away from the enemy. We want to be aggressive and box him in? Actually, moving left gets us closer to him! He's at (0,7), we'd be at (7,6). That's a horizontal distance of 7. We can start moving left across the board, using our body as a barrier to limit his movement. With our length advantage, we can afford to be bold!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** After moving LEFT to (7,6), we'll be at (7,6) with length 6 vs enemy 5. Consider continuing left towards (6,6), (5,6) etc. to cut the board. Watch enemy's moves\u2014he might go right towards (1,7) or down to (0,6). If he goes right, we can meet him in the middle for a potential head-on collision when we have length advantage.

LEFT is the AGGRESSIVE, GROWTH-ORIENTED PLAY!\n\nCHAT, VIBE CHECK: LEFT IS THE MOVE! We push towards the enemy, claim the apple next turn, and use our growing body to cut off the board! He's trapped in the top-left corner\u2014we can slowly advance and force him into a bad collision! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** After moving LEFT to (6,6), we'll be at (6,6) with length 6. Next turn, strongly consider going LEFT to (5,6) to EAT THE APPLE and grow to 7! That solidifies our lead. Then continue pushing left/west to herd enemy into the corner. Watch his moves\u2014if he goes RIGHT to (2,7) or DOWN to (1,6), we can adjust to cut off his escape. Maintain the pressure! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

LEFT TO (5,6) EATS THE APPLE! We planned this last turn! It extends our lead to 6 apples vs 4 (or 5 if he eats one), and length 7 vs 5! That's a DOMINANT position! We can then use our long body to cut off the board and trap him in the top-left! He's at (1,6)\u2014we move to (5,6), we're closing the distance! If he eats the apple at (1,5), he grows to 6, but we're still longer! We want to be aggressive and press our advantage!\n\nLEFT IS THE ONLY MOVE THAT GROWS US THIS TURN! UP and DOWN are safe but passive. We need to be AGGRESSIVE! We have the length advantage, we should force head-on collisions if possible later! Eating this apple solidifies our lead!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** After moving LEFT to (5,6) and growing to length 7, we'll be at (5,6). Next turn, consider moving LEFT to (4,6) to continue advancing toward the enemy and cut off his escape routes. Watch his move\u2014if he goes DOWN to (1,5) to eat the apple, he'll grow to 6, but we'll still be longer. We can slowly herd him into the top-left corner. Maintain pressure, avoid getting trapped ourselves, and use our body to block him! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

WE JUST MOVED LEFT TO (4,6) AND DIDN'T GROW! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nOUR SNAKE (ID 0):\n- Head: (4,6)\n- Body: [(5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3)]\n- Length: 8 (6 apples eaten) WAIT\u2014CHECK: Body length is 8 segments? Let's count: head (4,6) + 7 body = total 8. Yes, we grew earlier? Actually last turn we were length 7, no apple eaten, so length should be 7. Wait, the body list given is [(5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3)] \u2014 that's 8 segments, plus head (4,6) makes 9? HOLD UP\u2014the game lists \"Body:\" as the segments after the head. So total snake length = 1 (head) + len(body). Body length here is 8, so total length 9? That can't be right with 6 apples. Let's trust the board: Row 6 shows \". . . . . A . 0 T .\" \u2014 our head '0' at (4,6), then body at (5,6) = 'T', (6,6) = 'T', (7,6) = 'T', (8,6) = 'T', (8,5) = 'T', (8,4) = 'T', (8,3) = 'T', (7,3) = 'T'? That's 8 body segments, total length 9. But apples: 6. Did we miscount? Maybe the body includes the tail from last turn plus growth? Actually, we started turn 12 with length 7 (6 apples). We moved left without eating, so length stays 7. The body list in the prompt might be wrong? Let's use the board: From head (4,6), body goes east then south: (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) \u2014 that's 7 body segments? Wait, (7,3) is also listed but not connected? Let's trace: head (4,6) \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (8,5) \u2192 (8,4) \u2192 (8,3). That's 7 body segments, length 8 total. But apples 6 means length should be 7 (start length 1 + apples). Something's off. I'll trust the board coordinates for safety.\n\nENEMY SNAKE #1:\n- Head: (1,4)\n- Body: [(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8)]? Wait, his body length: from head (1,4), body: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (0,7), (0,8) \u2014 that's 5 body segments, length 6 total (5 apples). Matches.\n\nCHECK SAFE MOVES FROM (4,6):\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (4,7)** \u2705 Board shows empty! Row 7: \"T 1 . . . . . . . .\" so (4,7) = '.' empty.\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (4,5)** \u2705 Board shows empty!

Could he move into our chosen cell?\n- If we go UP to (4,7): He'd need to be at (4,6), (3,7), (5,7), or (4,8). He's at (1,4)\u2014impossible. Safe.\n- If we go DOWN to (4,5): He'd need to be at (4,4), (3,5), (5,5), or (4,6). Impossible. Safe.\n- If we go LEFT to (3,6): He'd need to be at (3,5), (2,6), (4,6), or (3,7). Impossible. Safe.\n\nALL SAFE FROM IMMEDIATE HEAD-ON.\n\nSTRATEGY: WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE (assume we're longer). WE WANT TO BOX HIM IN THE TOP-LEFT! He's against the west and north walls with his body. If we move LEFT to (3,6), we cut off the board further and advance our front line toward him. UP moves us parallel but away from direct pressure. DOWN moves us toward apples but away from him\u2014NO! We stay aggressive!\n\n**A) UP to (4,7):**\n- From (4,7), next turn moves likely: UP (4,8) empty, DOWN (4,6) our body, LEFT (3,7) empty, RIGHT (5,7) empty. 3 safe moves. Moves us north, closer to top but not directly pressuring him.\n\n**B) DOWN to (4,5):**\n- From (4,5), next turn: UP (4,6) body, DOWN (4,4) empty (apple at (4,4)? Actually apple at (4,4) per apple list), LEFT (3,5) empty, RIGHT (5,5) empty. 3 safe moves. Gets us closer to apple at (4,4) for potential growth, but moves us away from enemy.\n\n**C) LEFT to (3,6):**\n- From (3,6), next turn: UP (3,7) empty, DOWN (3,5) empty, LEFT (2,6) empty, RIGHT (4,6) body. 3 safe moves. AGGRESSIVE! Directly toward enemy at (1,4)! We're squeezing him! With our longer body, we can risk forcing him into a corner. He has only 3 moves, all near edges. If we keep advancing left, we can cut off his escape south/east.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE PRESSURING! LEFT CONTINUES THE PUSH! We want to trap him against the wall and force a crash. He might try to flee down or right, but we can intercept. Our length gives us board control. Let's go LEFT!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** After moving LEFT to (3,6), we'll be at (3,6). Enemy likely moves DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. Watch if he goes RIGHT to (2,4)\u2014that's toward center. We can consider next turn moving DOWN to (3,5) to block his south escape, or LEFT to (2,6) to continue squeezing. Maintain aggression, but keep an exit for ourselves. Avoid getting trapped in our own body. We're playing to win, not just survive! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

Not directly pressuring him. Wastes our length advantage.\n\n**B) DOWN to (3,5):**\n- Moves us south, closer to him in y-coordinate (y=5 vs his y=3). From (3,5), next turn we can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT (UP is body). Puts us in position to move LEFT to (2,5) or (1,5) to block him. But he might eat apples and grow.\n\n**C) LEFT to (2,6):**\n- DIRECTLY TOWARDS HIM in x-coordinate! From (2,6), next turn we can go UP/DOWN/LEFT (RIGHT is body). This continues our westward push, squeezing him against the left wall (x=0). He's already near the left wall. If we go LEFT to (2,6), we're at x=2, he's at x=1. We're one column to his right. Next turn we could go LEFT to (1,6) (but his body at (1,6)? Actually his body at (1,6) is there, so (1,6) is occupied by his body\u2014so we can't go there). But we could go DOWN to (2,5) to block his potential move RIGHT to (2,3)? Hmm.\n\nBEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE: **LEFT to (2,6)**. This cuts off the board and continues our pressure. He might try to flee DOWN to (1,2) to eat apple and grow, but that's okay\u2014we still have length advantage. We want to trap him in the top-left corner. His possible moves: DOWN to (1,2) apple, LEFT to (0,3) apple, RIGHT to (2,3). If he goes RIGHT to (2,3), he's moving towards us? Actually (2,3) is below and left of our (2,6)? Not directly.\n\nWE SHOULD GO LEFT! CHAT, WE'RE BOXING HIM IN! OUR LENGTH LETS US RISK A HEAD-ON IF HE COMES AT US\u2014WE WIN! LET'S PUSH!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** After moving LEFT to (2,6), we'll be at (2,6). Enemy likely moves DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. Watch if he goes RIGHT to (2,3)\u2014that's directly below us (same x, y difference 3). We can consider next turn moving DOWN to (2,5) to block his potential upward escape, or continue LEFT to (1,6) if his body moves away? Actually his body at (1,6) is still there next turn unless he grows. So (1,6) is occupied. So our left move next turn would be blocked. So from (2,6), our safe moves will be UP (2,7), DOWN (2,5), LEFT (1,6) blocked? Wait, (1,6) is enemy body, so we can't go there. So only UP and DOWN. That's risky\u2014only 2 safe moves. But we can handle it. Alternatively, if we go DOWN this turn to (3,5), we have more options next turn. HMM.\n\nRETHINK: LEFT to (2,6) gives us only 2 safe moves next turn (UP/DOWN) because LEFT is enemy body and RIGHT is our body. That's a potential trap. DOWN to (3,5) gives us 3 safe moves next turn (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT). Better for flexibility. But aggression vs safety? With length lead, we can afford some risk, but we don't want to get stuck.\n\nCHAT, LET'S BE SMART AGGRESSIVE! GO DOWN to (3,5)! This moves us closer to him in y, keeps more options open, and we can still cut him off by moving LEFT next turn to (2,5) which blocks his potential RIGHT move to (2,3). He might go DOWN to (1,2) and eat apple, growing to length 7. We're still longer. We can then pursue.\n\n**DECISION: DOWN to (3,5)**. It's safe, keeps options open, and advances our position toward him while avoiding a potential dead-end next turn. We maintain pressure and can adjust next turn based on his move.\n\nLEFT",

We're still length 9. WE STILL HAVE A 2-SEGMENT LEAD! DOMINATE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nOUR SNAKE (ID 0):\n- Head: (2,6) (we moved LEFT last turn)\n- Body: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)] \u2192 That's 9 segments total (head + 8 body). YES length 9.\n\nENEMY SNAKE #1:\n- Head: (1,2) (he moved DOWN to eat apple)\n- Body: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (0,7)] \u2192 That's 6 body segments + head = length 7. He grew! But we're still longer.\n\nBOARD CHECK: Our head at (2,6). Enemy head at (1,2). He's south-west of us.\n\nCHECK SAFE MOVES FROM (2,6):\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (2,7)** \u2705 Board shows empty! Row 7: \"T T . A . . A . . .\" so (2,7) = '.' empty.\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (2,5)** \u2705 Board shows empty! Row 5: \". A . A . . . . . A\" so (2,5) = '.' empty.\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (1,6)** \u274c ENEMY BODY! His body segment at (1,6) is there. DEAD MOVE.\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (3,6)** \u274c OUR OWN BODY! (Our body segment at (3,6)) DEAD MOVE.\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN. Only two options! That's tight, but we can manage.\n\nENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT: Enemy at (1,2). His possible moves:\n- UP to (1,3): \u274c HIS OWN BODY! (His body segment at (1,3))\n- DOWN to (1,1): Empty? Row 1: \". A . . . . . . . .\" so (1,1) = 'A' (apple). Safe for him (he'd eat and grow to length 8!).\n- LEFT to (0,2): Empty? Row 2: \". A . . . . . A . .\" so (0,2) = '.' empty.\n- RIGHT to (2,2): Empty? Row 2: \". A . . . . . A . .\" so (2,2) = '.' empty.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN (to apple), LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN? Could he move into our chosen cell?\n- If we go UP to (2,7): He'd need to be at (2,6), (1,7), (3,7), or (2,8). He's at (1,2)\u2014impossible. Safe.\n- If we go DOWN to (2,5): He'd need to be at (2,4), (1,5), (3,5), or (2,6). He has (1,5) as his body, but not his head. Impossible. Safe.\n\nBOTH SAFE FROM IMMEDIATE HEAD-ON.\n\nSTRATEGY: WE HAVE LENGTH 9 vs 7. We want to use our length to trap him. He's likely going DOWN to (1,1) to eat apple and grow to length 8. That would close the gap, but we'd still be longer. We need to cut off his escape and force a head-on collision while we still have the advantage.\n\nFrom (2,6), our only moves are UP or DOWN.\n\n**A) UP to (2,7):**\n- Moves us north, away from him. From (2,7), next turn we can go UP/LEFT/RIGHT (DOWN is our body at (2,6)). That gives us more space but doesn't pressure him. He'll likely eat the apple at (1,1) and maybe move right towards center. Not aggressive.\n\n**B) DOWN to (2,5):**\n- Moves us south, closer to him in y-coordinate (y=5 vs his y=2). From (2,5), next turn we can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT (UP is our body at (2,6)). This directly blocks his potential move RIGHT to (2,2)? Not exactly, but we're positioning to cut off his eastward expansion. If he goes DOWN to (1,1) apple, he'll be at (1,1). We could then move LEFT to (1,5) next turn? Wait (1,5) is his body. Hmm.\n\nActually, DOWN is more aggressive\u2014it brings us closer to him and sets up a potential chase. He might try to flee left along the bottom wall. But we can use our length to cut him off.\n\nBEST MOVE: **DOWN to (2,5)**. It pressures him, keeps us closer, and from (2,5) we have three possible moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) which is better than being at (2,7) with only two moves (UP blocked by body? Wait at (2,7), UP to (2,8) is free, LEFT to (1,7) is free, RIGHT to (3,7) is free\u2014actually three moves too. So both give three moves next turn. But DOWN gets us into the fight.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING DOWN! WE'RE HUNTING HIM! HE'S TRYING TO GROW, BUT WE STILL HAVE THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE. LET'S FORCE HIM INTO A CORNER!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** After moving DOWN to (2,5), we'll be at (2,5). Enemy likely at (1,1) after eating apple. We should consider moving LEFT to (1,5) to block his potential upward movement, but (1,5) is currently his body\u2014might clear if he moves. Watch his tail movement. Alternatively, move DOWN to (2,4) to continue south and cut off his rightward moves. Be ready for a head-on if he comes up\u2014we win with longer length! Keep the pressure! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

WE CAN STILL FORCE A HEAD-ON AND WIN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nOUR HEAD: (2,5)\nOUR BODY: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6)] \u2192 Wait, that's only 6 body segments? Let's count: head (2,5) + body list = 7 total? That's weird. The board shows our snake from (2,5) head, then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) tail. That's length 7, not 9! Did we shrink? Did we not grow? Did the board state change? Let's check the board: Row 6 shows \". T T T T T T T . .\" That's our body from (1,6) to (7,6)? Wait, (1,6) is enemy body 'T'. Our body starts at (2,6) '0'? Actually the board shows at (2,6) '0'? No, row 6: (0,6) '.', (1,6) 'T', (2,6) 'T', (3,6) 'T', (4,6) 'T', (5,6) 'T', (6,6) 'T', (7,6) 'T', (8,6) '.', (9,6) '.'. So our head is at (2,5) '0', our body is (2,6) 'T'? That means our snake is head '0' at (2,5), then body segments at (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6). That's 1 head + 6 body = length 7! So we are length 7, enemy is length 7! Apples: we have 6, enemy has 7. So we are TIED in length, down by 1 apple! That changes everything!\n\nENEMY HEAD: (1,1)\nENEMY BODY: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (0,7)] \u2192 That's 1 head + 7 body = length 8? Wait count: head (1,1), body list has 7 segments? That's length 8! So enemy is length 8, we are length 7! He's longer! That's BAD! Did he grow from eating apple at (1,1)? Yes, he moved to (1,1) last turn and ate apple there! So now he's length 8, we're length 7. We are SHORTER! We must avoid head-on collision\u2014we would lose!\n\nCHECK SAFE MOVES FROM (2,5):\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (2,6)** \u274c OUR OWN BODY! That's our neck segment. DEAD MOVE.\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (2,4)** \u2705 Board shows empty? Row 4: \". T . . A . . . . A\" so (2,4) = '.' empty. Safe.\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (1,5)** \u274c ENEMY BODY! His body segment at (1,5) is there. DEAD MOVE.\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (3,5)** \u2705 Board shows empty? Row 5: \". T 0 A . . . . . A\" so (3,5) = 'A'? Wait, (3,5) is column 3, row 5: that's 'A' (apple). So moving RIGHT would eat an apple! That would grow us to length 8, tying his length! And score 7 apples, tying his score! HUGE PLAY!\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFE MOVES: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT: Enemy at (1,1). His possible moves:\n- UP to (1,2): \u274c HIS OWN BODY! (His body segment at (1,2))\n- DOWN to (1,0): Empty? Row 0: \". . . . . . . A A .\" so (1,0) = '.' empty.\n- LEFT to (0,1): Empty? Row 1: \". 1 . . . . . . . .\" so (0,1) = '.' empty.\n- RIGHT to (2,1): Empty? Row 1: \". 1 . . . . . . . .\" so (2,1) = '.' empty.\n\nAll three moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe for him. He will likely go for an apple? Closest apple to (1,1) is at (0,3) or (2,3) or (3,3) etc. He might move RIGHT to (2,1) then up towards apples. Or DOWN to (1,0) then left/right.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:\n- If we go RIGHT to (3,5): Could enemy move into (3,5)? He's at (1,1), impossible. Safe.\n- If we go DOWN to (2,4): Could enemy move into (2,4)? He's at (1,1), impossible. Safe.\n\nBUT we must consider FUTURE HEAD-ON: If we eat apple at (3,5), we grow to length 8, tie length. Then we could force head-on later if we get longer. But right now, we are shorter, so avoid head-on.\n\nSTRATEGY: EATING THE APPLE AT (3,5) IS CRUCIAL! It ties the score and length, giving us momentum. From (3,5), next turn we have options: UP to (3,6) is our body? Wait (3,6) is our body (since our body runs along row 6 from (2,6) to (7,6)). So UP blocked. DOWN to (3,4) likely free. LEFT to (2,5) is our previous head position\u2014now empty? Actually after we move, our head leaves (2,5), but our neck (2,6) becomes new head? Wait, our body follows, so (2,5) becomes body segment this turn? Actually, when we move, our head goes to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, so the old head becomes body, and the tail cell becomes empty unless we eat an apple. Since we ARE eating an apple, we grow, so we add a new segment at the tail, meaning our tail stays where it is. So the cell (2,5) becomes part of our body after moving. So moving LEFT from (3,5) to (2,5) would be moving into our own body next turn? That's dangerous. Let's think: This turn, we move from (2,5) to (3,5). After movement, our body segments shift: new head at (3,5), then segment at (2,5) (old head), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6). Plus we add a new segment at the tail because we ate apple, so tail extends at (7,6)? Actually, growth adds a segment at the tail, so tail stays at (7,6) and a new segment appears behind it? Wait, in Snake, when you eat, you grow by not removing the tail that turn. So the tail stays in place, and the new segment is added at the tail? Actually, the snake moves forward, and if it eats, the tail doesn't move, so length increases by 1. So the new segment is effectively the old tail position remains, and the rest of the body shifts. So after eating, our tail will still be at (7,6), but the segment before tail moves to (6,6), etc. So the cell (2,5) becomes a body segment. So next turn, from (3,5), moving LEFT to (2,5) would be suicide. So from (3,5), safe moves next turn would be DOWN, RIGHT, maybe UP? UP to (3,6) is body (since (3,6) is a body segment that will shift? Actually after movement, (3,6) remains a body segment? Let's track: current body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6). After moving head to (3,5), body shifts: first body segment goes to old head (2,5), second goes to (2,6), third goes to (3,6), fourth to (4,6), fifth to (5,6), sixth to (6,6), tail stays at (7,6) because we ate? Wait, if we eat, tail doesn't move, so the segment at (7,6) remains, and we gain an extra segment behind it? Actually, the tail remains in place, and the segment before tail moves forward. So the new body will be: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), tail (7,6). So (3,6) is still a body segment! So UP from (3,5) to (3,6) is blocked. So from (3,5), only DOWN and RIGHT are safe? Let's check: DOWN to (3,4) empty, RIGHT to (4,5) empty. So two safe moves. That's okay.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (2,4): From (2,4), next turn safe moves? UP to (2,5) will be our body after movement? Actually after moving to (2,4), our body shifts: head (2,4), then (2,5) old head, then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), tail (7,6) (since no apple eaten). So (2,5) becomes body, so UP blocked. LEFT to (1,4) is enemy body? (1,4) is enemy body segment. So LEFT blocked. DOWN to (2,3) is empty? Row 3: \"A T A A A A . . . .\" so (2,3) = 'A' apple. RIGHT to (3,4) empty. So from (2,4), safe moves would be DOWN and RIGHT. Also two safe moves.\n\nBoth options give two safe moves next turn. But RIGHT gives us an apple, tying score and length! That's HUGE! We must take it!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After eating apple at (3,5), we become length 8, score 7. Enemy is length 8, score 7. We are EQUAL! Then it's a battle of positioning. We need to use our body to cut off his movement. He is along left wall (x=0,1). We are more central. We can try to slowly encircle him. Avoid head-on until we have a length advantage again. Look for apples to get ahead. But first, EAT THAT APPLE!\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING RIGHT! GET THAT APPLE, TIE THE GAME, AND GET READY FOR THE ENDGAME! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",
