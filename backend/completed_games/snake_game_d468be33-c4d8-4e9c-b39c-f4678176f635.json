They can move in 4 directions but are far enough that they won't immediately threaten us. Moving UP to (6,9) keeps us safe from them.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nCollect apples safely while avoiding traps. Starting with (6,9) gives us immediate points and good positioning near the top-right corner where there are multiple apples in the vicinity (6,6 is also an apple below us).\n\nThe UP move is clearly the best choice - it's safe, gets an apple, and positions us well for future moves.\n\nUP",

RIGHT or UP would delay reaching nearby apples and could open up more complex trap scenarios with the enemy.\n\nSTART PLAN\nAim for the closest apple along a safe path: move DOWN to (0,6) this turn, then DOWN to (0,5) on the next turn to eat the apple and grow. Keep monitoring the enemy head at (6,8); avoid paths that could lead to a sudden head-on or being forced into a corner. If an opportunity to safely reach other apples (e.g., (2,6) or (4,6)) appears, adjust by shifting directions to stay mobile and avoid self-trapping.\nEND PLAN\nDOWN",

Moving there would be immediate death (self-collision).\n\nSo, valid moves are DOWN and LEFT.\nComparing DOWN and LEFT:\n*   **DOWN (5,8)**: Moves towards the center of the board (where many apples are: (6,6), (4,6), (2,6), (4,4), (7,5), (5,3)). This opens up access to the central apple cluster.\n*   **LEFT (4,9)**: Stays on the edge (row 9). The only apple on row 9 is (2,9). Moving left gets me closer to (2,9), but (2,9) is far (distance 2). Moving down brings me closer to (6,6) (distance 3) and (4,6) (distance 3).\n\nStrategy: Since I am on the top row (y=9), I have limited options (only DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT along the edge). To get to the dense apple clusters in the middle of the board (rows 4-6), I must go DOWN. Staying on the top row limits my movement and leads to a dead end eventually. Moving DOWN opens up the board and allows me to maneuver toward the central apples. Also, the apple at (6,6) is directly below the empty space at (6,8) and (6,9).\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,8) is the best move to expand my territory and head towards the high-value area.\n\n**Plan:** Move DOWN to (5,8) to descend from the top edge and head towards the central apple cluster at (6,6) and (4,6).\n\nDOWN",

Moving UP puts my head directly into my own body. This results in immediate death.\n        *   **Verdict:** **INVALID.**\n\n    *   **LEFT (`(4, 8)`):**\n        *   **Collision Check:** `(4, 8)` is empty ('.' on the board).\n        *   **Immediate Safety:** Safe.\n        *   **Enemy Threat:** Enemy head `(0, 4)` is far away (Manhattan distance 8). No immediate head-on collision risk.\n        *   **Future Options:**\n            *   From `(4, 8)`, possible moves are `UP` (out of bounds), `DOWN` (`(4, 7)`), `LEFT` (`(3, 8)`), `RIGHT` (`(5, 8)`).\n            *   `DOWN` to `(4, 7)` is empty.\n            *   `LEFT` to `(3, 8)` is empty.\n            *   `RIGHT` returns to `(5, 8)`.\n            *   This move keeps me relatively high on the board (y=8), which provides access to the dense apple cluster at `y=6` (e.g., `(4, 6)`, `(2, 6)`, `(6, 6)`).\n\n    *   **DOWN (`(5, 7)`):**\n        *   **Collision Check:** `(5, 7)` is empty ('.' on the board).\n        *   **Immediate Safety:** Safe.\n        *   **Enemy Threat:** Safe.\n        *   **Future Options:**\n            *   From `(5, 7)`, moves are `UP` (`(5, 8)`), `DOWN` (`(5, 6)`), `LEFT` (`(4, 7)`), `RIGHT` (`(6, 7)`).\n            *   **Critical Observation:** Looking at row 6: `(4, 6)`, `(6, 6)`, `(2, 6)` are all apples. Row 6 is a high-value zone.\n            *   If I move `DOWN` to `(5, 7)`, my next move could be `DOWN` to `(5, 6)`.\n            *   However, if I move `LEFT` to `(4, 8)` now, I can reach `(4, 6)` in two moves (`DOWN` to `(4, 7)`, then `DOWN` to `(4, 6)`). Similarly, `(2, 6)` is reachable from `(4, 8)`.\n            *   Moving `DOWN` to `(5, 7)` places me in a column with no apples at `(5, 6)`, forcing a horizontal move to reach the nearest apples at `(4, 6)` or `(6, 6)`.\n            *   Moving `LEFT` to `(4, 8)` aligns me vertically with the apple at `(4, 6)`.\n\n3.  **Strategic Comparison:**\n    *   Moving `LEFT` to `(4, 8)` positions the head directly above the apple at `(4, 6)` (2 steps away) and horizontally aligned with the apple at `(6, 6)` (also 2 steps away). This is a strong central position.\n    *   Moving `DOWN` to `(5, 7)` moves me to a position with no apples on the adjacent row (Row 6 at x=5 is empty). It requires a detour to reach the nearest apples.\n    *   The board shows that the area `x=4` to `x=6` at `y=6` is rich in apples. Securing a position closer to this cluster is advantageous.\n    *   The enemy is far away (x=0), posing no immediate threat to the center.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   `LEFT` is the superior move. It avoids a dead-end on the top wall, aligns me with the nearest high-density apple cluster at `y=6` (specifically the apple at `x=4`), and maintains a safe distance from the boundary while keeping options open.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (4, 8) to align vertically with the apple at (4, 6) and position for a run down the center column. This avoids the empty column at x=5 and sets up an approach to the (4,6), (6,6), and (2,6) apple cluster.\n\nLEFT",

My immediate goal is to secure the apple at (4,6) by moving DOWN from (4,8). The apple at (4,6) is valuable because it clears a path to the dense cluster at y=6 (x=2, x=4, x=6). I need to avoid trapping myself against the top wall (y=9) or getting boxed in by the enemy. The enemy is likely moving away from me (towards y=4 or y=2), so the center is relatively safe for now.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n1.  **My Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (4, 8)\n    *   Body: [(5, 8)]\n    *   Apples: 1\n    *   Last Move: LEFT (from (5, 8) to (4, 8))\n2.  **Enemy Snake #1:**\n    *   Head: (0, 3)\n    *   Body: [(0, 4)]\n    *   Apples: 1\n    *   Likely direction: Since the head moved from (0, 4) to (0, 3), and the body is at (0, 4), the snake grew (ate an apple). This suggests it moved DOWN to (0, 3) to eat an apple (likely the one at (0, 0) or (0, something)? Wait, looking at the board state in the prompt: Apples include (0,0) and (4,0). The enemy head is at (0,3). The apple at (0,0) is far. The apple at (4,0) is far. Actually, the board state shows a \"T\" at (5,8) in the visualization? No, that's my tail. Let's re-read the board state carefully.\n    *   Board Visualization provided in prompt:\n        ```\n         9 . . A . . . . . . .\n         8 . . . . 0 T . . . .\n         7 . . . . . . . . . .\n         6 . . A . A . A . . .\n         5 . . . . . . . A . .\n         4 T . . . A . . . A .\n         3 1 . . . .

A . . . A .`. At (5,4) there is a `T`? No, the column 5 is the 6th column (0,1,2,3,4,5...). The row 4 is the 5th line. `(5,4)` is an `A` according to the text \"4 T . . . A . . . A .\". Let's check coordinates. `(0,4)` is row 4, col 0. `(5,4)` is row 4, col 5. The text says `A` at col 5. So the `T` is at `(0,4)`? No, the text says `4 T . . .`. This implies `T` is at (0,4). But the enemy snake #1 is at `(0,3)` head and `(0,4)` body. So the board visualization matches: `(0,4)` is the enemy body (marked T for Tail? Or just Body?). `(0,3)` is enemy head (marked 1).\n    *   Where did the enemy move from? It was at `(0,4)` (head) and `(0,5)` (body) last turn. Now it is at `(0,3)` (head) and `(0,4)` (body). It moved DOWN. It must have eaten an apple at `(0,3)`? No, the apple list includes `(0,0)`, `(5,0)`, `(4,0)`, etc. `(0,3)` is empty in the visual (`1` is the snake head). Wait, let's check the apple list again: `(0,0), (4,0), (5,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)`. The enemy didn't eat at `(0,3)`.\n    *   *Correction:* The enemy moved from `(0,4)->(0,3)`. The body was `(0,5)->(0,4)`. This is a normal move. If it ate, it would have grown. The board shows `1` at `(0,3)` and `T` at `(0,4)`. The board shows no apple at `(0,3)`. So the enemy just moved there.\n    *   *Wait*, looking at the board state again:\n        `3 1 . . . . A . . . A`\n        `4 T . . . A . . . A .`\n        There is an `A` at `(4,4)` (and `(9,4)`, `(9,3)`).\n        Is there an apple at `(0,3)`? No.\n        So the enemy moved DOWN to `(0,3)`. It is heading towards the bottom-left area where there are apples at `(0,0), (4,0), (5,0)`.\n    *   My current position is `(4,8)`. My body is `(5,8)`. I am quite high up.\n\n**Turn 4 Analysis:**\n1.  **My Options from (4, 8):**\n    *   **UP (4, 9):** Out of bounds (y max is 9? Wait, 0-9 is 10 units. 9 is valid. But looking at the board, row 9 is `9 . . A . . . . . . .`. (4,9) is '.'.\n        *   *Risk:* If I go to (4, 9), I am at the top wall. From there, I can only go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. If I go UP again, I die. This restricts my future moves.\n    *   **DOWN (4, 7):** This is empty ('.' on board).\n        *   *Benefit:* This moves me closer to the apple at (4, 6).\n        *   *Body Collision:* My body is at (5, 8). (4, 7) is not my body.\n    *   **LEFT (3, 8):** This is empty ('.' on board).\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 8):** This is my own body (Tail). Moving here would kill me immediately. **INVALID.**\n\n2.  **Safety Check:**\n    *   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (0, 3). Body at (0, 4). It is moving DOWN or staying vertical? It's likely going for the apples at the bottom. It is far away (Manhattan distance ~8-9). It is not an immediate threat to my head-on collision unless I move towards it.\n    *   **My Body:** (5, 8). If I move LEFT to (3, 8) or DOWN to (4, 7), I am safe. If I move UP to (4, 9), I am safe but restricted.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Apple Targeting:** The densest cluster of apples is at Y=6: `(2,6), (4,6), (6,6)`.\n    *   My current position is (4, 8). The apple at (4, 6) is directly below me (2 steps away).\n    *   **Option DOWN (to 4,7):**\n        *   Next turn, from (4,7), I can go DOWN to (4,6) to eat the apple.\n        *   From (4,7), I can also go LEFT (3,7) or RIGHT (5,7).\n        *   This seems the most direct path to a guaranteed apple (4,6).\n    *   **Option UP (to 4,9):**\n        *   Moves me to the edge. The apple at (4,9) doesn't exist. The apple at (3,9) or (5,9) doesn't exist.\n        *   This forces me to retreat later. Not ideal.\n    *   **Option LEFT (to 3,8):**\n        *   Moves me away from the (4,6) apple.\n        *   Moves me towards the left side. The apple at (2,6) is reachable from here, but further than (4,6) is from (4,8).\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   The move **DOWN** to (4, 7) is the strongest. It puts me in a position to eat the apple at (4, 6) on the very next turn.\n    *   While moving UP to (4, 9) is safe, it puts me in a corner (top wall) and delays my approach to the apple cluster.\n    *   The enemy is at the bottom left (x=0). I am in the center/upper middle (x=4). I have space to maneuver.\n\n    *   *Self-Correction/Deep Think:* The last move was LEFT to (4,8). The body is at (5,8). If I move DOWN to (4,7), my body will move to (4,8). This leaves (5,8) empty.\n    *   Is there any immediate head-on collision risk?\n        *   Enemy is at (0,3). It is moving. Where can it move?\n        *   It can move DOWN to (0,2) (empty), LEFT (invalid), RIGHT (1,3) (empty), UP (0,4) (its own body? No, wait. If it moves UP to (0,4), that's its *current* tail position. In standard Snake rules, the tail moves *after* the head. If the snake moves UP to (0,4), it moves into the cell its body is currently occupying. This is usually fatal *unless* it eats an apple at (0,4) which would cause it to grow. Is there an apple at (0,4)? No. So moving UP is likely suicide for the enemy (unless they are very dumb).\n        *   The enemy is likely moving DOWN to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,3) to pursue apples at (0,0) or (4,0)/etc.\n        *   I am at x=4. The enemy is at x=0. A head-on collision is extremely unlikely.\n\n    *   **Plan:** Move DOWN to (4, 7). Next turn, move DOWN to (4, 6) to eat the apple.\n\n**Final Check:**\n*   Move: DOWN\n*   New Head: (4, 7)\n*   Is (4, 7) empty? Yes ('.' on board).\n*   Is (4, 7) out of bounds? No (0-9).\n*   Is (4, 7) my own body? No (Body is (5,8)).\n*   Is (4, 7) enemy body? No (Enemy is at x=0).\n\nThis move is safe and advances my objective.\n\nDOWN",

I should target the apple at (2,6) next. My direct path is LEFT to (4,6), but that is occupied by my own body. I must take a detour to avoid cutting off my own escape route. Moving DOWN to (5,5) is safe and avoids the immediate collision. From (5,5), I can move LEFT to (4,5) and then UP to (4,6), or continue moving towards the other available apples like (6,6) or (7,5). The enemy snake is still near the bottom left and poses no immediate threat. I need to ensure I don't trap myself against my own body. Moving DOWN is the safest immediate move that opens up the path to the left cluster.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n1.  **My Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (5, 6)\n    *   Body: [(4, 6), (4, 7)]\n    *   Apples: 3 (just ate at 4,6)\n2.  **Enemy Snake #1:**\n    *   Head: (0, 1)\n    *   Body: [(0, 2)]\n    *   Apples: 1\n    *   Status: Enemy is at (0,1), likely targeting (0,0) or (4,0).\n3.  **Target Apple:**\n    *   (2, 6): 2 steps Left. Blocked by own body at (4,6).\n    *   (6, 6): 1 step Right.\n    *   (5, 5): 1 step Down. (Not an apple, but a safe pathing move).\n4.  **Safety Check:**\n    *   **UP (5,7):** My body is at (4,7).

The apple at (2,6) will still be there or grow elsewhere, but the bottom cluster is rich.\n    *   Also, moving DOWN avoids the body at (4,6) naturally.\n\n    *   *Correction:* The apple at (6,6) is literally right there. Taking the guaranteed point is usually correct. But let's look at the board again.\n        ```\n        9 . . A . . . . . .\n        8 . . . . T . . . .\n        7 . . . . T . . . .\n        6 . .

My body becomes [(5,6), (4,6), (4,7)].\n        Next turn, I can move to (6,5) or (7,6) or (6,7).\n        This seems fine.\n        \n        Let's reconsider the \"Don't trap yourself\" rule.\n        My body is at (4,6) and (4,7).\n        If I go RIGHT to (6,6), I am at (6,6).\n        If I go DOWN to (5,5), I am at (5,5).\n        \n        The bottom left has apples at (4,4), (5,3), (5,1), (4,0).\n        The cluster at (2,6) is nice, but (4,4) is closer vertically.\n        \n        Let's look at the immediate safety of LEFT.\n        LEFT is (4,6). That is my body. I cannot go LEFT.\n        \n        So the choices are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n        UP (5,7): Safe. Moves toward top right.\n        DOWN (5,5): Safe.

Body (4,6), (4,7).\n        The apple at (6,6) is visible.\n        \n        Let's look at the enemy. Enemy is at (0,1). Very far.\n        \n        Is there any danger in taking the apple at (6,6)?\n        From (6,6), I can go to (6,5) or (7,6) or (6,7).\n        This keeps options open.\n        \n        Is there danger in going DOWN?\n        From (5,5), I can go to (5,4) (Apple at 5,3 below), (4,5) (Apple at 4,4 below), (6,5) (Safe).\n        \n        The \"Long-term plan\" I wrote in my head (before outputting) was to go DOWN to access the cluster.\n        But RIGHT is an immediate point.\n        \n        Let's look at the \"Rules\". \"prefer moves that both increase your chance of safely eating apples\".\n        RIGHT eats an apple.\n        \n        However, I must be careful of \"future options\".\n        If I am at (6,6), I am at the edge of the map (x=9 is right edge, so 6 is not the edge).\n        Actually, (6,6) is fine.\n        \n        Let's check the board for \"7 5\" which is an apple.\n        (7,5) is an apple.\n        If I go RIGHT to (6,6), I am adjacent to (7,5).\n        \n        Okay, the decision is between RIGHT (guaranteed apple) and DOWN (positioning).\n        \n        Usually, eating an available apple is the best move unless it leads to a trap.\n        Going to (6,6) does not lead to a trap.\n        \n        However, I noticed I am at (5,6). My body is at (4,6) and (4,7).\n        If I go RIGHT to (6,6), my body is (5,6), (4,6), (4,7).\n        If I go DOWN to (5,5), my body is (5,6), (4,6), (4,7).\n        \n        The map shows a tight space at x=4.\n        If I stay near x=4, I am walking along my own body.\n        Moving RIGHT to x=6 separates me from my body.\n        \n        Yes, moving RIGHT to (6,6) is the best move. It grabs an apple and moves me into open space.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Analyze the Current State**\n*   **Turn:** 7\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (5, 6)\n    *   Body: [(4, 6), (4, 7)]\n    *   Apples: 2\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:**\n    *   Head: (1, 1)\n    *   Body: [(0, 1)]\n    *   Apples: 1\n    *   Location: Bottom left quadrant. Not an immediate threat to my current position.\n*   **Board Map:**\n    *   My head is at (5, 6).\n    *   My body occupies (4, 6) and (4, 7).\n    *   Apples near me:\n        *   (6, 6) - 1 step Right\n        *   (2, 6) - 3 steps Left (blocked by my body at (4, 6) directly in the path)\n        *   (5, 5) - 1 step Down (Empty, not an apple, but safe)\n        *   (5, 7) - 1 step Up (Empty, not an apple, but safe)\n\n**2. Evaluate Possible Moves**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6):**\n    *   Target coordinates: (4, 6)\n    *   Status: **OCCUPIED BY MY BODY.**\n    *   Result: Death.\n    *   Verdict: **ILLEGAL.**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 6):**\n    *   Target coordinates: (6, 6)\n    *   Status: Contains an apple ('A').\n    *   Collision Risk: Empty.\n    *   Board Edges: (6, 6) is well within the 10x10 board (indices 0-9).\n    *   Result: Snake grows by 1. Score increases to 3. New body becomes [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)].\n    *   Future Outlook: From (6, 6), I have access to (6, 5), (7, 6), and (6, 7). This moves me away from the crowded left side and my own body.\n\n*   **UP to (5, 7):**\n    *   Target coordinates: (5, 7)\n    *   Status: Empty.\n    *   Collision Risk: Low. My body is at (4, 7) (adjacent), but not at (5, 7).\n    *   Result: No apple. No growth.\n    *   Future Outlook: Moves me toward the top-right corner. (5, 8) is empty. However, this moves away from the central apple cluster.\n\n*   **DOWN to (5, 5):**\n    *   Target coordinates: (5, 5)\n    *   Status: Empty.\n    *   Collision Risk: Low.\n    *   Result: No apple. No growth.\n    *   Future Outlook: Moves me toward the center. From (5, 5), I can reach (5, 4) (near apple at 5,3) or (4, 5) (near apple at 4,4). This is a safe pathing move but delays scoring.\n\n**3. Decision Process**\n*   **Safety Check:** LEFT is fatal. RIGHT, UP, and DOWN are all safe regarding immediate collisions. Enemy snake is at (1, 1), nowhere near (5, 6).\n*   **Scoring vs. Positioning:**\n    *   RIGHT offers an immediate apple. Taking an available apple is generally optimal in Snake games unless it forces a trap.\n    *   Checking for traps: Moving to (6, 6) does not trap me. My tail will move from (4, 7) to (4, 6) (assuming I don't grow, but since I *am* eating, the tail stays at (4, 7) effectively because I add a segment). Wait, if I eat, I grow. My body becomes [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)]. This is a valid snake shape.\n    *   Comparing RIGHT vs. DOWN/UP:\n        *   Moving DOWN/UP saves the apple at (6, 6) for later. Is it safe to save it?\n        *   From (5, 6), moving DOWN to (5, 5) or UP to (5, 7) leaves (6, 6) available.\n        *   However, looking at the map, (6, 6) is somewhat isolated on the right. The denser cluster is lower left/center: (4,4), (5,3), (7,5).\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (6, 6), I am at x=6. If I go DOWN to (5, 5), I am at x=5.\n        *   The apple at (2, 6) is to the left, but my body at (4, 6) blocks the direct path. I would have to loop around, which takes time.\n        *   The apple at (6, 6) is the closest reachable apple (1 move). The next closest is (7, 5) (2 moves via Right-Down) or (5, 5) is empty but leads to apples.\n        *   Standard Snake strategy dictates taking the closest safe apple unless it leads to a dead end.\n        *   (6, 6) is not a dead end. It has 3 exits (excluding the one I came from, which is effectively blocked by my body immediately after moving).\n\n**4. Final Verification**\n*   **Move:** RIGHT\n*   **Target:** (6, 6)\n*   **Check 1 (Board):** (6, 6) is within 0-9 for both x and y. **Pass.**\n*   **Check 2 (Self Collision):** My body is at (5, 6) and (4, 6). (6, 6) is empty. **Pass.**\n*   **Check 3 (Enemy Collision):** Enemy is at (1, 1). **Pass.**\n*   **Check 4 (Benefit):** Gains 1 apple. Increases score to 3. **Pass.**\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to eat the apple at (6, 6). This secures a point and moves me into an open area. From (6, 6), I will look to move Down or Right to access the cluster of apples in the center of the board (specifically targeting (7, 5) or (5, 3) next).\n\nRIGHT",

Since I consumed an apple, I grow. The tail at (4, 7) does *not* move this turn. The new body becomes [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)].

My body occupies (5, 6), (4, 6), and (4, 7).\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (6, 7)**\n    *   **Target:** (6, 7).\n    *   **Safety:** Is (6, 7) occupied?\n        *   My body: (4, 7) is at x=4, so no collision. (5, 6) and (4, 6) are lower. **Safe.**\n        *   Enemy: Far away. **Safe.**\n        *   Board limits: y=9. **Safe.**\n    *   **Future:** From (6, 7), I can go to (6, 8), (7, 7), or (5, 7). (5, 7) is currently empty. (7, 7) is empty. This moves me away from the dense apple cluster in the center/bottom (5,3, 4,4, 5,5, 7,5). This is a move toward the top-right corner, which might be risky if I get trapped up there later.\n\n*   **Option B: DOWN to (6, 5)**\n    *   **Target:** (6, 5).\n    *   **Safety:** Is (6, 5) occupied?\n        *   My body: No. The closest part is (5, 6) (diagonal). **Safe.**\n        *   Enemy: No. **Safe.**\n        *   Board limits: y=0. **Safe.**\n    *   **Future:** From (6, 5), I can go to (6, 4), (7, 5), (5, 5).\n        *   (7, 5) is an Apple.\n        *   (5, 5) is empty (leads to potential apples at 5,3 and 4,4).\n        *   (6, 4) is empty.\n    *   **Analysis:** This moves me *towards* the central apple cluster. It keeps options very open. (6, 5) is a central pivot point.\n\n*   **Option C: RIGHT to (7, 6)**\n    *   **Target:** (7, 6).\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 6) is empty on the map. **Safe.**\n    *   **Future:** From (7, 6), I can go to (7, 5) (Apple), (8, 6), or (7, 7).\n    *   **Analysis:** This moves toward the apple at (7, 5). However, looking at the map, (7, 6) is a \"hallway\" of sorts. If I go RIGHT to (7, 6), my body will trail back to (6, 6). From (7, 6), if I then go DOWN to (7, 5) to eat the apple, I will be at (7, 5) with my body filling (7, 6) and (6, 6). This leaves me with only (7, 4) and (6, 5) as valid moves (assuming I haven't grown further). (6, 5) is currently blocked by my own body if I am at (7, 5). Wait, if I am at (7, 5), my body is at (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)... so (6, 5) is free. But (6, 5) is adjacent to (6, 6) which is my body, so (6, 5) is a safe move. The right side (8, 5) is open. This path is viable.\n\n*   **Option D: LEFT to (5, 6)**\n    *   **Target:** (5, 6).\n    *   **Safety:** (5, 6) is occupied by my body (it is my neck). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **Verdict:** ILLEGAL.\n\n**3. Comparison and Strategy**\nComparing DOWN (6, 5) vs. RIGHT (7, 6) vs. UP (6, 7):\n\n*   **UP (6, 7):** Moves away from the main apple cluster. While safe, it isolates me in the top-right. I currently have 3 apples. The enemy has 1. I should prioritize score acceleration. Moving UP delays scoring opportunities.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 6):** Moves toward the apple at (7, 5). However, (7, 6) is a narrow spot. If I commit to (7, 6), I am essentially funneling myself toward (7, 5).\n*   **DOWN (6, 5):** This is the key position.\n    *   It is central.\n    *   It offers access to (7, 5) (Apple) to the right.\n    *   It offers access to (5, 5) to the left.\n    *   It offers access to (6, 4) below.\n    *   It connects to the area around (5, 3) and (4, 4) which are high-value zones.\n    *   From (6, 5), if I need to retreat, I can go back up to (6, 6) (which will be free by then because I will have moved, unless I ate an apple and grew, but usually the tail moves).\n\n**Decision:**\n**DOWN to (6, 5)** is the superior move.\n1.  **Safety:** It is fully safe.\n2.  **Positioning:** (6, 5) is a \"hub\" cell. It connects the right side (7, 5) to the center-left (5, 5) and bottom (6, 4).\n3.  **Scoring:** It puts me one step away from the apple at (7, 5) and two steps away from the cluster at (5, 3) and (4, 4).\n4.  **Enemy:** The enemy is at (2, 1). By staying in the center-right, I maintain a buffer zone. If I go UP or RIGHT too aggressively, I might corner myself near the wall, making it easier for the enemy to eventually cut off paths if they grow (though currently they are small).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (6, 5) to centralize. From there, evaluate moving towards the apple at (7, 5) or pivoting left towards the cluster at (5, 3)/(4, 4). Maintain awareness of the enemy's expansion from the bottom-left.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n*   Move: DOWN\n*   Target: (6, 5)\n*   Board Boundaries: (6, 5) is within [0, 9] x [0, 9]. OK.\n*   Self Collision: My body is at (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7). (6, 5) is empty. OK.\n*   Enemy Collision: Enemy is at (2, 1). OK.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Analysis of the current board state (Turn 9):\n- **My Position**: Head at (6, 5), Body at [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)].\n- **Enemy Position**: Snake #1 at Head (3, 1), Body [(2, 1)].\n- **Immediate Threats**:\n  - (6, 6) is currently occupied by my body. I cannot go UP back to (6, 6) without dying.\n  - (5, 5) is empty.\n  - (7, 5) contains an apple.\n  - (6, 4) is empty.\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 6)**:\n    - **Status**: **DEADLY**.\n    - **Reason**: (6, 6) is currently occupied by the second segment of my own body (my neck). Moving backwards kills the snake immediately.\n    - **Verdict**: Eliminated.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 4)**:\n    - **Status**: Safe.\n    - **Coordinates**: (6, 4).\n    - **Future Options**: From (6, 4), I can move to (6, 3), (5, 4), or (7, 4).\n    - **Apple Proximity**: Nearest apple is at (6, 1) (distance 3) or (7, 5) (distance 2). This move keeps me relatively central but moves away from the apples at (7, 5) and (5, 5).\n    - **Risk**: Low immediate risk.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 5)**:\n    - **Status**: Safe.\n    - **Coordinates**: (5, 5).\n    - **Future Options**: From (5, 5), I can move to (5, 4), (5, 6), or (4, 5).\n    - **Apple Proximity**: (5, 5) is empty now, but adjacent to apples at (5, 3) (down), (4, 4) (left), and (5, 0) (down-left). This is a central hub for the apple cluster in the lower-middle-left of the board.\n    - **Risk**: Low. Moving toward the apple cluster increases potential scoring but also potential traffic.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 5)**:\n    - **Status**: Safe (contains an apple).\n    - **Coordinates**: (7, 5).\n    - **Future Options**: From (7, 5), I can move to (7, 4), (8, 5), or (7, 6).\n    - **Apple Proximity**: I eat the apple at (7, 5) immediately (+1 point).\n    - **Risk**: (7, 5) is near the edge of the board (x=9). While (8, 5) is open, moving too far right can eventually lead to a trap against the wall if not careful. However, looking at the map, (7, 6) is currently empty. The path back to (6, 6) is blocked by my body, but (6, 5) will become free on the next turn as my tail moves (assuming I don't eat another apple immediately to extend my length).\n\n**Comparison and Decision:**\n- **LEFT (5, 5)** is a strong strategic position. It places my head in the center of the board's lower half, surrounded by potential apples ((5, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0)). It maximizes future flexibility.\n- **RIGHT (7, 5)** guarantees an apple gain immediately. However, looking at the board state:\n  - Row 5: `. . . . . . . A . .`\n  - If I go RIGHT, I consume the apple at (7, 5).\n  - From (7, 5), the best move next turn is likely DOWN to (7, 4) or LEFT to (6, 5) (once it clears).\n  - However, the apple cluster at (5, 3) and (4, 4) is very dense. Securing territory around that cluster is valuable.\n  - The enemy snake is at (2, 1). If I go LEFT, I am positioning myself to compete for the apples in the center-left (4,4) and bottom-left (5,0) areas. If I go RIGHT, I am moving away from the enemy and the densest cluster.\n\n**Risk Analysis - Enemy Interaction:**\nThe enemy is at (3, 1). They are slow and currently low. They are not an immediate threat to my head position at (6, 5).\nIf I move **RIGHT to (7, 5)**, I get an apple. This is the \"safe\" points play.\nIf I move **LEFT to (5, 5)**, I move toward the densest apple cluster. This is the \"territory\" play.\n\nGiven the board state, the apple at (7, 5) is somewhat isolated compared to the cluster at (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 0). Gaining territory in the center is usually more advantageous for long-term survival and scoring flexibility. However, consuming an apple is also vital for growth.\n\nLet's look closely at the coordinates:\n- (6, 5) -> LEFT -> (5, 5).\n- (6, 5) -> RIGHT -> (7, 5) (Apple).\n- (6, 5) -> DOWN -> (6, 4).\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I eat an apple. My body length increases. My tail (4, 6) won't move this turn.\nNext turn from (7, 5), I can go DOWN to (7, 4) (safe) or LEFT to (6, 5) (which will be empty next turn).\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 5), I am positioning for the (4, 4) apple or (5, 3) apple.\n\nActually, looking at the \"Board State\" text provided in the prompt again:\nRow 4: `. A . . A . . . A .` -> (5, 4) is empty.\nRow 3: `. A . . . A . . . A` -> (5, 3) is empty (wait, (5, 3) is an apple per the \"Apples at\" list, but the map shows `. . . A` at coordinates 3,4,5,6... let's check the map text again).\n*Map Check:*\nRow 3 (y=3): `. A . . . A . . . A`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nIndex 2 is '.'.\nIndex 3 is '.'.\nIndex 4 is '.'.\nIndex 5 is 'A'.\nSo (5, 3) IS an apple (The 'A' is at index 5).\n(4, 4) is an apple (Row 4 index 4 is 'A').\n\nMoving **LEFT to (5, 5)** places me adjacent to (4, 4) and (5, 3). This is a very strong cluster position.\nMoving **RIGHT to (7, 5)** grabs a single apple but puts me near the wall.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am currently at (6, 5). The apple at (7, 5) is right there. Eating it guarantees a score increase. However, if I eat it, I become longer, and my immediate path becomes slightly constrained (can't go back up immediately).\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 5), I open up the path to (4, 4) and (5, 3). I also maintain the ability to pivot right or down.\n\nIs the apple at (7, 5) worth the potential risk of being cornered?\nIf I take (7, 5):\n- Next turn: (7, 5) -> (7, 4). From (7, 4), I can go (7, 3), (6, 4), (8, 4).\nIf I take (5, 5):\n- Next turn: (5, 5) -> (5, 4) or (4, 4) or (5, 6). (5, 6) is my body eventually.\n- (4, 4) is an apple.\n\nGiven the turn count (9/150) and the low score (3 vs 1), I need to grow. The apple at (7, 5) is the closest. Eating it is a solid tactical move. It removes an apple from the board and grows my snake. While it's on the right edge, the board is only 10x10, so being at x=7 isn't a death sentence yet, especially with (8,5) and (7,4) available.\n\nHowever, the prompt asks to \"outwit him and outlast him\". Moving into the dense cluster (Left) secures territory. Moving Right takes a free apple.\nLet's reconsider the map.\nThe apple at (7, 5) is isolated.\nThe apples at (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 0) form a group.\nSecuring the group is usually better. But the apple at (7, 5) is *immediate*.\n\nLet's look at the \"Board State\" again.\nRow 6: `. . A . T T T . . .`\nWait, the board state shows `T T T` at indices 3, 4, 5 on row 6? No, looking at the map:\n`9 . . A . . . . . . .`\n`6 . . A . T T T . . .`\nIndices:\n0: '.'\n1: '.'\n2: 'A'\n3: '.'\n4: 'T'\n5: 'T'\n6: 'T'\n...\n\nWait, looking at the provided board state text in the prompt:\n`6 . . A . T T T . . .`\nThis corresponds to y=6.\nx=0: '.'\nx=1: '.'\nx=2: 'A'\nx=3: '.'\nx=4: 'T'\nx=5: 'T'\nx=6: 'T'\nx=7: '.'\n...\n\nMy body is at (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). According to this map, (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) are 'T' (Tail/Body). Correct.\nBut note (2,6) is 'A' (Apple).\nAnd (3,6) is '.' (Empty).\n\nSo, I am at (6, 5). If I go LEFT to (5, 5), I am at (5, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 5), I am at (7, 5).\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 4), I am at (6, 4).\n\nThe apple at (7, 5) is valuable. Let's check the risks of taking it.\nIf I take (7, 5):\n- I am at (7, 5).\n- My body length increases.\n- Next turn, I cannot go UP to (7, 6) because... wait, (7, 6) is currently empty (Row 6 index 7 is '.').\n- Actually, if I eat (7, 5), my tail (4, 6) won't move.\n- From (7, 5), I can go UP (7, 6), DOWN (7, 4), LEFT (6, 5).\n- (6, 5) will be empty next turn (unless I crash, but my body moves).\n- (7, 6) is empty.\n- (7, 4) is empty.\n\nSo, taking (7, 5) is safe and yields an apple.\nComparing to LEFT (5, 5):\n- (5, 5) is currently empty.\n- (5, 5) connects to (4, 4) (Apple) and (5, 3) (Apple).\n- (5, 5) also connects to (5, 6), which is my body (neck).\n- (5, 5) connects to (6, 5) (current head).\n\nIf I go LEFT, I have to be careful not to get trapped against my own body.\nIf I go RIGHT, I get an apple immediately.\nGiven the low turn count (9), securing points is good.\nThe apple at (7, 5) is \"free\".\nThe apples at (4, 4) and (5, 3) require me to navigate through the center.\n\nLet's look at the enemy. (3, 1).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving away from the enemy. The enemy is slow. I have time.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving towards the center.\nThe apple at (7, 5) is isolated. Taking it doesn't commit me to a bad path.\n\nLet's compare the \"Future Options\" strictly:\n**RIGHT (7, 5):**\n- Eat apple (+1).\n- Options: (7, 6), (7, 4), (6, 5).\n- (6, 5) is the position I just left. It will be free.\n- (7, 6) is empty.\n- (7, 4) is empty.\n- This seems very open.\n\n**LEFT (5, 5):**\n- No apple.\n- Options: (5, 6) [Blocked by my body], (4, 5), (5, 4).\n- Wait, (5, 6) is currently occupied by my body (the neck). If I move to (5, 5), then (5, 6) is still occupied by the body segment that was at (6, 6) (if I don't eat an apple) or (6, 6) (if I do eat).\n- Actually, if I don't eat an apple, my tail (4, 6) moves.\n- My body becomes: Head (5, 5), (6, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6).\n- (5, 6) is occupied. So I cannot go BACK to (6, 5) immediately? No, I can go to (6, 5) from (5, 5). That's forward relative to the previous head direction (6->5 is left).\n- But from (5, 5), I cannot go UP to (5, 6) because that is my body.\n- So from (5, 5), valid moves are (4, 5), (5, 4). (6, 5) is valid.\n- So I have 3 options (4,5), (5,4), (6,5). This is also open.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe apple at (7, 5) is right there. It's a guaranteed point. The apple cluster at (4, 4) is also valuable, but (7, 5) is immediately accessible.\nThe board state shows I am at (6, 5).\n(6, 5) is adjacent to (7, 5) (Apple) and (5, 5) (Empty).\nUsually, taking a guaranteed apple is the correct move unless it leads to immediate death or a trap.\n(7, 5) does not look like a trap. It leads to the right edge, but the board is small.\nAlso, consider that the apple at (7, 5) is an \"outlier\". If I don't take it now, it might be harder to get to later if I block myself. If I move into the center (Left), I might have to fight through the cluster to get to (7, 5) again.\nTaking (7, 5) now clears the right side.\nAlso, looking at the map, (7, 5) is an apple. (5, 5) is empty.\nPoints win games. I am tied 3-1 (actually I have 3, enemy has 1). I should extend the lead.\n\nOne final check: Is there any collision?\nMy head (6, 5) -> (7, 5).\nMy body: (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6).\n(7, 5) is empty.\nEnemy: (3, 1). Far away.\nBoundaries: (7, 5) is valid.\n\nSo, RIGHT to (7, 5) is a safe, point-gaining move.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (7, 5) to eat the apple.\n2. On the next turn, evaluate moving DOWN to (7, 4) to stay central and keep options open, or LEFT to (6, 5) if safe.\n\n**Double check:**\nThe prompt says \"Think very hard... Ultrathink\".\nIs there a reason NOT to take (7, 5)?\nIf I take (7, 5), I am at x=7.\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 5), I am at x=5.\nThe enemy is at x=3.\nGoing Left puts me in the middle, potentially squeezing the enemy if he wants to expand right. But he is at y=1, I am at y=5. We are not vertically aligned yet.\nGoing Right gets a point.\nLet's look at the apple list: `(7, 5)` is in the list.\n`(5, 5)` is NOT in the list.\nSo (5, 5) is just a transit point. (7, 5) is a resource.\n\nI will take the resource.\n\nOne detail: The move is simultaneous.\nIf the enemy is at (3, 1) and moves UP to (3, 2), no issue.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (3, 2) and I move to (7, 5), no issue.\nThere is no head-on collision risk.\n\nFinal check on the \"backwards\" rule.\nMoving from (6, 5) to (7, 5).\nMy previous head was (6, 5)? No, wait.\nTurn 8 info: \"Head: (6, 6)\". \"Last move: DOWN\".\nSo Turn 8 I was at (6, 6) and moved DOWN to (6, 5).\nWait, the \"Last Move Info\" says:\n\"START LAST MOVE PICK\nDOWN\nEND LAST MOVE PICK\"\nAnd \"Your Snake (ID: 0): Head: (6, 5)\"\nSo I am currently at (6, 5).\nMy previous position was (6, 6).\nMy body is currently [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)].\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5), I am not moving backwards (which would be UP to (6, 6)).\nSo it is safe.\n\nWait, looking at the prompt again:\n\"Your Snake (ID: 0): Head: (6, 5) Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]\"\nIf I move UP, I go to (6, 6). (6, 6) is in my body list. So UP is illegal.\nIf I move RIGHT, I go to (7, 5). (7, 5) is not in my body list. Safe.\nIf I move LEFT, I go to (5, 5). Safe.\nIf I move DOWN, I go to (6, 4). Safe.\n\nThe apple is at (7, 5). It is the only immediate reward.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\n**Short Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (7, 5) to extend my lead. From (7, 5), move towards the central area (DOWN or LEFT) to access the dense apple cluster (4, 4), (5, 3) while keeping the right flank open.\n\n**Final Move:**\nRIGHT\n\nWait, I should be careful.\nThe map shows:\nRow 5: `. . . . . . . A . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(7, 5) is indeed an apple.\n\nLet's check if (5, 5) might be better.\nIf I go to (5, 5), I am \"sandwiching\" the enemy? No, enemy is at (3, 1).\nIf I go to (7, 5), I am securing a point.\nGiven the game is about points and survival, and (7, 5) is safe and yields a point, I should take it.\nUsually, \"Center control\" is good. (5, 5) is more central than (7, 5).\nHowever, (7, 5) is an apple. (5, 5) is empty.\nPoints > Position (in the early game, especially when leading).\nI have 3 apples. Enemy has 1. I should push the lead.\nAlso, (7, 5) is not a bad position. It's just not the *center*.\nBut (7, 5) allows access to (7, 4), (8, 5), (7, 6).\n(5, 5) allows access to (5, 4), (4, 5), (6, 5).\nBoth offer 3 directions (since (5,6) is blocked for (5,5) and (6,6) is blocked for (6,5) -> wait, (6,5) is blocked? No, (6,5) is my current position.\nFrom (5, 5), I can go (6, 5). That is back the way I came.\nFrom (7, 5), I can go (6, 5). That is back the way I came.\nSo both have similar \"retreat\" options.\nBut (7, 5) has an apple.\nSo (7, 5) is strictly better than (5, 5) for this turn.\n\nWhat about (6, 4)?\n(6, 4) is empty.\n(6, 4) is closer to the apples at (6, 1), (5, 0).\nBut (7, 5) is an apple *right now*.\nTaking (7, 5) is the best move.\n\nOne final check on \"outwitting\".\nIs there a trap?\nIf I go to (7, 5), the enemy cannot reach me this turn.\nNext turn, if I am at (7, 5), I am safe.\nIf I go to (5, 5), I am also safe.\nThe difference is the apple.\nI will take the apple.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nWait, looking at the apple list again:\n(6, 1), (2, 6), (0, 0), (5, 1), (4, 0), (9, 3), (8, 4), (5, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4), (7, 5), (5, 3), (2, 9), (1, 3), (1, 4)\n(7, 5) is in the list.\n(5, 5) is NOT in the list.\n(6, 4) is NOT in the list.\nSo RIGHT is the only move that yields an immediate point.\n\nWhy would I not take it?\nMaybe if (7, 6) or (8, 5) were blocked. But they are empty.\nMaybe if the enemy could intercept me next turn. The enemy is at (3, 1). They would need to travel 5+ tiles in 1 turn. Impossible.\n\nSo, RIGHT is correct.\n\nWait, let's look at the map one last time.\n`5 . . . . . . . A . .`\nIndex 7 is 'A'.\nMy head is at (6, 5).\n(6, 5) is index 6.\nSo I am moving from index 6 to index 7.\nThis is valid.\n\nOne edge case: Head-on collision.\nMy head moves to (7, 5).\nAny other snake head moving to (7, 5)?\nEnemy head is at (3, 1).\nCan enemy reach (7, 5) in one turn? No.\nSo no head-on collision.\n\nI am confident in RIGHT.\n\n**Plan:**\nEat the apple at (7, 5). Prepare to move towards the center (Down/Left) on the next turn to engage the cluster at (4, 4) / (5, 3).\n\n**Move:**\nRIGHT",

The cluster of apples at (4, 4), (5, 3), and (5, 0) is high-value territory.\nCurrent Position: (6, 5). Target: (7, 5) for the immediate point.\nNext Turn Considerations:\nAfter eating (7, 5), my tail (4, 6) remains until I eat again or 5 turns pass (depending on game rules, usually 5 turns without eating kills you, but usually tails just don't move until you eat). Wait, in standard Snake, the tail moves every turn unless you eat. Actually, in this specific \"multi-apple\" variant described, it's likely the standard rules where the tail moves every turn, extending length if an apple is eaten.\nActually, re-reading the prompt: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\".\nGrowth usually means the tail doesn't move.\nWait, the prompt says: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point\".\nIt doesn't explicitly state the tail behavior, but standard snake rules imply the tail stays if you eat, moves if you don't.\nHowever, the prompt *does* say: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nThis implies the body segments move in a chain.\nIf I eat (7, 5), I grow. My tail (4, 6) might stay. My body becomes (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 6) (new tail is same as old tail).\nIf I don't eat, my tail moves forward. (4, 6) -> (5, 6).\nThe board state says: \"Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]\".\nThis implies the order is Head -> Body -> Tail.\nWait, the prompt says: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\nCurrent Head: (7, 5).\nCurrent Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)].\nWait, the provided board state says \"Head: (7, 5)\".\nWait, the prompt says:\n\"Your snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (7, 5)\n  - Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]\"\nWait, the prompt says \"Turn: 10 / 150\".\nAnd \"Your last move information: ... RIGHT\".\nAnd \"START LAST MOVE PICK ... RIGHT ... END\".\nWait, if my last move was RIGHT, and I was at (6, 5) previously...\nPrevious state (Turn 9): Head at (6, 5).\nCurrent state (Turn 10): Head at (7, 5).\nThis implies I successfully moved RIGHT to (7, 5).\nWait, if I moved RIGHT to (7, 5), and there was an apple there, I should have grown.\nBut the \"Body\" list hasn't changed length? It still has 4 segments.\nMaybe I didn't eat? Or maybe the list just hasn't updated the tail yet in the description?\nLet's check the apples list again.\nApples at: (6, 1), (2, 6), (0, 0), (5, 1), (4, 0), (9, 3), (8, 4), (5, 0), (4, 4), (5, 3), (2, 9), (1, 3), (1, 4), (7, 7), (9, 4)\nWait, (7, 5) is NOT in the list!\nThe prompt says: \"Apples at: ...\" and lists them.\nThen it says: \"Board state: ... 4 . A . . A . . . A A\".\nRow 4 is y=4.\nColumn 7 is x=7.\nRow 4, Col 7 is '.'.\nWait, the map shows Row 5 (y=5): \". . . . . . . A . .\"\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo (7, 5) is indeed an 'A' on the map.\nBut the \"Apples at:\" list provided at the top does NOT include (7, 5).\nThis is a discrepancy.\nThe \"Apples at:\" list is usually the source of truth for scoring.\nHowever, the map shows (7, 5) as 'A'.\nMaybe the map is the ground truth?\nOr maybe I am hallucinating the map?\nLet's look at the map again carefully:\n`5 . . . . . . . A . .`\nThis is y=5.\nx=7 is 'A'.\nSo (7, 5) has an apple.\nWhy isn't it in the list?\nThe list says: `(6, 1), (2, 6), (0, 0), (5, 1), (4, 0), (9, 3), (8, 4), (5, 0), (4, 4), (5, 3), (2, 9), (1, 3), (1, 4), (7, 7), (9, 4)`\nIt does NOT contain (7, 5).\nThis is very strange. The map says A, the list says no.\nIf I move to (7, 5) and there is no apple, I don't eat.\nIf I move to (7, 5) and there IS an apple (per map), I eat.\nThe prompt says \"Apples at:\".\nUsually, the list is what matters.\nBUT, looking at the previous turn's rationale (the \"last rationale\" provided in the prompt), the AI said: \"RIGHT to (7, 5): Status: Safe (contains an apple).\"\nSo the AI *thought* there was an apple there.\nAnd the map shows an apple there.\nThe list provided might be incomplete or I should trust the map visualization.\nHowever, if I rely on the map, (7, 5) is an apple.\nIf I rely on the list, (7, 5) is NOT an apple.\nIf I trust the map, I should eat (7, 5).\nIf I trust the list, (7, 5) is just empty space.\nGiven that the map visualization is often generated from the state, and the list is a summary, I will assume the map is correct and the list might be missing (7, 5) for some reason (or maybe I am misreading the map).\nWait, is (7, 5) an apple?\nMap Row 5: `. . . . . . . A . .`\nYes.\nSo, I should eat (7, 5).\n\nWait, let's re-read the prompt carefully.\n\"Turn: 10 / 150\"\n\"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (7, 5)\"\n\"Apples at: ... (7, 7) ...\"\nIf I am at (7, 5), and I need to make a move.\nWait, if I am at (7, 5), and I am *making* the move for Turn 10, that means I arrived at (7, 5) *after* Turn 9.\nSo, did I eat an apple at (7, 5) on Turn 9?\nIf I ate, my length should have increased.\n\"Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]\"\nLength is 5 (Head + 4 body).\nIf I ate, I should be length 6.\nThe prompt says \"Scores so far: ... Your snake (ID 0) apples: 4\".\nIf I ate (7, 5), it would be 5 apples.\nThe score is 4. So I did NOT eat an apple at (7, 5).\nThis means (7, 5) was NOT an apple.\nThis means the map visualization in the prompt text is incorrect or misleading, or the 'A' at (7, 5) is a visual artifact or refers to something else?\nOr, perhaps the 'A' at (7, 5) was eaten by the enemy? No, enemy is at (3, 1).\nOr, perhaps the 'A' at (7, 5) is just not there?\nLet's look at the map again.\n`5 . . . . . . . A . .`\nIf (7, 5) is an apple, and I am at (7, 5), and I didn't score, then the game is broken.\nOR, the map is showing the *current* board state, and I am currently sitting on the apple spot, but haven't \"processed\" the eating yet? No, scores are given \"so far\".\nIf I am at (7, 5) and there is an apple, I should have eaten it and my score should be 5.\nMy score is 4.\nConclusion: (7, 5) is NOT an apple.\nThe map is wrong or the 'A' is actually my body or something?\nNo, my body is `T` on the map.\nWait, the map key: `0` is my head. `T` is my body. `1` is enemy head.\n`A` is apple.\nMap Row 5: `. . . . . . . A . .`\nx=7 is `A`.\nIf I am at (7, 5), and x=7 is `A`, then I am on an apple.\nIf I am on an apple, I should have eaten it.\nIf I didn't eat it, maybe it's because I just moved there and the turn hasn't \"finished\"?\nNo, the prompt says \"Turn: 10\". The move for Turn 9 is done. I am at (7, 5).\nIf there was an apple there, it's gone.\nIf it's gone, the map should show me `0` at (7, 5).\nThe map shows `A` at (7, 5).\nThis implies the map is static and the 'A' is still there.\nThis implies I am NOT at (7, 5)?\n\"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (7, 5)\"\nOkay, the text says I am at (7, 5).\nThe map says (7, 5) is an 'A'.\nThis is a contradiction.\nHowever, usually in these text-based games, the text description of the snake's position is the ground truth, and the map is just a visual aid that might not update perfectly or might have artifacts.\nBut if I am at (7, 5), and I need to move *now*, and I want to eat apples...\nIf (7, 5) was an apple and I didn't eat it, that would be a bug.\nAssuming the game is consistent, I am at (7, 5) and there is NO apple there.\nThe 'A' on the map at (7, 5) might be a mistake in the prompt generation, or perhaps it's an apple that I *cannot* eat because I am on it? (No, I eat when I move onto it).\nLet's look at the \"Apples at:\" list again.\nIt does NOT contain (7, 5).\nI must trust the \"Apples at:\" list over the map visual if they conflict, because the list is the data.\nSo, (7, 5) is empty.\nI am at (7, 5).\nNow I need to move for Turn 10.\n\nCurrent Position: (7, 5)\nBody: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]\nApples: (6, 1), (2, 6), (0, 0), (5, 1), (4, 0), (9, 3), (8, 4), (5, 0), (4, 4), (5, 3), (2, 9), (1, 3), (1, 4), (7, 7), (9, 4)\n\nPossible moves from (7, 5):\n1.  **UP to (7, 6)**:\n    *   Is it safe? (7, 6) is empty on the map (Row 6, Col 7 is '.').\n    *   Is it occupied by my body? My body is at (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6). (7, 6) is not in this list.\n    *   Is it an apple? No.\n    *   Result: Move to empty space.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 4)**:\n    *   Is it safe? (7, 4) is empty on the map (Row 4, Col 7 is '.'). Wait, Row 4: `. A . . A . . . A A`. Index 7 is '.'.\n    *   Is it occupied by my body? No.\n    *   Is it an apple? No.\n    *   Result: Move to empty space.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 5)**:\n    *   Is it safe? (6, 5) is currently my *second* body segment.\n    *   Wait, my body is `[(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]`.\n    *   (6, 5) is the segment *immediately* behind my head.\n    *   Rule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n    *   Result: **DEADLY**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 5)**:\n    *   Is it safe? (8, 5) is empty on the map (Row 5, Col 8 is '.').\n    *   Is it occupied by my body? No.\n    *   Is it an apple? No.\n    *   Result: Move to empty space.\n\nSo, LEFT is deadly.\nUP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe empty spaces.\n\nNow, which one is best?\nLet's look at apples nearby.\nMy head is at (7, 5).\nApples:\n(7, 7) - Distance 2 (Up).\n(8, 4) - Distance 2 (Right-Down).\n(9, 4) - Distance 3 (Right-Down).\n(9, 3) - Distance 3 (Right-Down).\n(5, 3) - Distance ~4 (Left-Down).\n(4, 4) - Distance ~4 (Left-Down).\n\nIf I go **UP to (7, 6)**:\n  - I get closer to (7, 7).\n  - (7, 7) is an apple.\n  - From (7, 6), I can go to (7, 7) next turn.\n  - However, (7, 6) is near the top right.\n  - From (7, 6), I can go (7, 7), (8, 6), (6, 6).\n  - (6, 6) is currently my body. By the time I am at (7, 6), my body will have moved.\n    - Old body: (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6).\n    - New head: (7, 6).\n    - New body: (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6).\n    - So (6, 6) will be part of my body.\n    - So from (7, 6), I cannot go LEFT to (6, 6) (it will be my body).\n    - I can go UP (7, 7) or RIGHT (8, 6).\n  - (7, 7) is an apple. This is a good path.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (7, 4)**:\n  - I get closer to (8, 4).\n  - (8, 4) is an apple (Right).\n  - (9, 4) is an apple (Right).\n  - (7, 4) is also close to the center.\n  - From (7, 4), I can go (7, 5), (6, 4), (8, 4), (7, 3).\n  - (7, 5) will be empty (previous head).\n  - (8, 4) is an apple.\n  - (6, 4) is empty.\n  - (7, 3) is empty.\n  - This gives good flexibility towards the center and the bottom-right apples.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (8, 5)**:\n  - (8, 5) is empty.\n  - From (8, 5), I can go (8, 4) (Apple!), (9, 5), (8, 6), (7, 5).\n  - (8, 4) is an apple.\n  - (9, 4) is an apple.\n  - This puts me very close to two apples.\n  - However, I am moving deeper into the right side of the board.\n  - (9, 5) is empty.\n  - (8, 6) is empty.\n  - Risk: If I go RIGHT, I might be funneling myself towards the wall if I don't find an exit.\n  - But with (8, 4) and (9, 4) right there, it's a good scoring opportunity.\n\nComparison:\n- **UP (7, 6)**: Targets (7, 7). Safe direction. Leads to top edge.\n- **DOWN (7, 4)**: Targets (8, 4) or (9, 4). Leads to bottom-right corner.\n- **RIGHT (8, 5)**: Targets (8, 4). Leads to bottom-right corner.\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 1). They are far away. They are not a threat to the right side immediately.\nThe most valuable immediate target is (8, 4) or (7, 7).\n(8, 4) is closer if I go DOWN or RIGHT.\n(7, 7) is closer if I go UP.\n\nLet's check the map for safety of these moves.\n(7, 6): Empty.\n(7, 4): Empty.\n(8, 5): Empty.\n\nIs there a trap?\nIf I go UP to (7, 6), I am committing to the top edge.\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I can still access the center (via (6, 4)) or the bottom-right corner.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5), I am committing to the corner.\n\nThe board is 10x10.\n(9, 9) is top right.\n(7, 6) is getting close to (7, 7) and (9, 9).\n(7, 4) is safer regarding space. It allows movement to (6, 4) which leads to the center (5, 4) and (4, 4).\nThe center cluster (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 0) is still there.\nThe right side has (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3).\nThe top has (7, 7), (2, 9).\n\nI want to avoid getting trapped in the corner.\nGoing DOWN to (7, 4) seems like the most flexible move.\nFrom (7, 4), I can:\n- Go RIGHT to (8, 4) (Apple).\n- Go LEFT to (6, 4) (Center access).\n- Go DOWN to (7, 3) (Access to lower rows).\n- Go UP to (7, 5) (Retreat).\n\nFrom (7, 6) (Up):\n- Go UP to (7, 7) (Apple).\n- Go RIGHT to (8, 6).\n- Go LEFT to (6, 6) (Body).\n- (Retreat to 7, 5).\n\nFrom (8, 5) (Right):\n- Go DOWN to (8, 4) (Apple).\n- Go RIGHT to (9, 5).\n- Go UP to (8, 6).\n- Go LEFT to (7, 5).\n\nThe cluster at (4, 4), (5, 3) is valuable.\nHowever, the apples on the right (8, 4), (9, 4) are also valuable.\nI am currently at (7, 5). I am already on the right side.\nIt makes sense to clear the apples on the right (which are closer) before venturing all the way back to the left center, unless the left center is extremely high value.\n(4, 4) is one apple. (5, 3) is one apple. (5, 0) is one apple.\nRight side: (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3), (7, 7).\nThere are several apples on the right.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I can eat (8, 4) next turn.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5), I can eat (8, 4) next turn.\nIf I go UP to (7, 6), I can eat (7, 7) next turn.\n\nWhich direction offers the best *long-term* path?\n(7, 7) is near the top.\n(8, 4) is near the bottom.\nThe bottom right is a corner. Corners are dangerous because you have fewer exits.\nThe top right is a corner.\n(7, 6) is not yet a corner. (7, 7) is getting close.\n(7, 4) is safe.\n\nWait, look at the map again.\nRow 4: `. A . . A . . . A A`\nRow 3: `. A . . . A . . . A`\nRow 2: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 1: `. . T T 1 A A . . .`\nRow 0: `A . . . . A A . . .`\n\nThere is a wall of apples at the bottom right (Row 0 indices 5,6).\nBut there is also (8, 4) and (9, 4) and (9, 3).\nThe bottom right corner (9,0) is empty.\nThe top right corner (9,9) is empty.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I am moving towards the \"denser\" part of the board (Rows 0-4).\nIf I go UP to (7, 6), I am moving towards the \"emptier\" part (Rows 6-9).\nThe map shows Row 6, 7, 8, 9 are mostly empty.\nRow 6 has apples at (2, 6) and my body.\nRow 7 has (7, 7).\nRow 9 has (2, 9).\nSo the top is relatively empty.\nThe bottom is full of apples and the enemy.\n\nGoing UP (7, 6) seems safer because there is more space to maneuver later. The bottom right is a corner.\nHowever, (7, 6) puts me right next to (7, 7) (Apple) and (8, 6) (Empty).\nIf I go UP to (7, 6):\n- Next turn I can eat (7, 7).\n- After eating (7, 7), I am at (7, 7).\n- From (7, 7), I can go (7, 8), (8, 7), (6, 7).\n- (6, 7) is empty.\n- (8, 7) is empty.\n- (7, 8) is empty.\n- This is a very safe area with lots of space.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4):\n- Next turn I can eat (8, 4).\n- After eating (8, 4), I am at (8, 4).\n- From (8, 4), I can go (8, 3), (9, 4), (8, 5), (7, 4).\n- (8, 3) is empty.\n- (9, 4) is an apple.\n- (8, 5) is empty.\n- (7, 4) is previous position.\n- From (8, 4), I am getting closer to the wall.\n\nComparing the \"future options\":\nFrom (7, 6): (7, 7), (8, 6), (6, 7). All empty or apple. Wide open space.\nFrom (7, 4): (8, 4), (9, 4), (8, 3), (7, 5). (8, 4) and (9, 4) are apples. (8, 3) is empty.\nActually, (7, 4) also offers (6, 4) which leads to (5, 4) and the center.\nThe center (4, 4) is an apple.\n\nSo, UP is safe and leads to a single apple (7, 7) and then open space.\nDOWN is safe and leads to a cluster of apples (8, 4, 9, 4) but is closer to the wall.\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 1). They are not an immediate threat to either side.\nHowever, the \"outlast\" objective implies avoiding walls as long as possible.\nThe top of the board (Rows 6-9) is mostly empty. The bottom (Rows 0-4) is crowded with apples.\nCrowded with apples means I want to go there to score.\nBut crowded also means potential traps if the enemy comes up.\nBut the enemy is slow.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Right\" move to (8, 5).\nFrom (8, 5):\n- (8, 4) is Apple (Down).\n- (9, 5) is Empty (Right).\n- (8, 6) is Empty (Up).\n- (7, 5) is Empty (Left).\nThis is also a central pivot.\n(8, 5) is slightly more \"cornered\" than (7, 4) or (7, 6).\n\nLet's look at the map again.\n`4 . A . . A . . . A A`\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4):\nI am at y=4.\n(6, 4) is empty. (Left).\n(5, 4) is empty (Index 5 of row 4 is '.').\nWait, row 4: ` . A . . A . . . A A`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(5, 4) is '.'.\n(4, 4) is 'A' (Index 4).\nSo if I go to (7, 4), I am very close to (4, 4).\nDistance from (7, 4) to (4, 4) is 3 steps.\nDistance from (7, 4) to (8, 4) is 1 step.\nDistance from (7, 4) to (7, 7) is 3 steps.\n\nIf I go UP to (7, 6):\nDistance to (7, 7) is 1 step.\nDistance to (4, 4) is ~5 steps.\n\nSo, (7, 4) is better for the cluster (4, 4).\n(7, 6) is better for (7, 7).\n\nWhich cluster is better?\n(4, 4) is part of a group: (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 0).\n(7, 7) is isolated.\n\nAlso, there is (8, 4) and (9, 4) near (7, 4).\nSo (7, 4) is the \"hub\" for the lower-right and lower-center apples.\n(7, 6) is the hub for the upper-right apple.\n\nGiven the apples are more dense in the lower half (and my snake is currently in the lower half), staying in the lower half seems reasonable.\nHowever, I am already at y=5.\n(7, 4) is just one step down.\n(7, 6) is one step up.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4):\nI open up the path to (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4) (Apple).\nOr (7, 4) -> (8, 4) (Apple).\n\nIf I go UP to (7, 6):\nI open up the path to (7, 7) (Apple).\n\nIs there a risk in going DOWN?\nThe enemy is at (3, 1). They are far.\nMy body is at (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6).\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4):\nNext turn I can go (6, 4).\n(6, 4) is empty.\nIf I go (6, 4), I am getting closer to my body at (6, 5) and (6, 6).\nBut my body will have moved.\nOld body: (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6).\nNew body (after move to 7, 4): (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6).\nSo (6, 5) and (6, 6) are occupied.\nSo from (7, 4), I cannot go UP to (7, 5) next turn? No, (7, 5) will be occupied by my neck.\nWait, from (7, 4), I can go:\n- (7, 5) -> Neck (Occupied).\n- (7, 3) -> Safe.\n- (8, 4) -> Safe.\n- (6, 4) -> Safe.\nSo I have 3 safe moves from (7, 4).\n\nIf I go UP to (7, 6):\nNew body: (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6).\nFrom (7, 6), I can go:\n- (7, 5) -> Neck (Occupied).\n- (7, 7) -> Safe.\n- (8, 6) -> Safe.\n- (6, 6) -> Body (Occupied).\nSo I have 2 safe moves from (7, 6).\n\n(7, 4) offers 3 safe moves. (7, 6) offers 2 safe moves.\n(7, 4) is more flexible.\n\nAlso, (7, 4) allows access to the cluster (4, 4).\nThe cluster (4, 4) is valuable.\nI should take the move that keeps my options open and leads to the cluster.\n(7, 4) is the best choice.\n\nFinal check on immediate death:\n- (7, 4) is empty.\n- (7, 4) is not my body.\n- (7, 4) is not enemy body (Enemy is at y=1).\n- (7, 4) is not off-board.\n\nSo, DOWN is safe and strategically superior.\n\nOne small detail: The map shows (7, 4) as empty.\nThe map shows (6, 4) as empty.\nThe map shows (5, 4) as empty.\nThe map shows (4, 4) as 'A'.\nThis path is clear.\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 1). They cannot reach (7, 4) in one turn.\n\nDecision: DOWN.\n\nOne final check on the \"Apples at\" list.\n(4, 4) is in the list.\n(8, 4) is in the list? No.\nWait, (8, 4) is NOT in the list.\n`Apples at: ... (9, 3), (8, 4) ...`\nWait, `(8, 4)` is in the list.\nYes: `(9, 3), (8, 4)`.\nSo (8, 4) is an apple.\n(9, 4) is in the list.\n(7, 7) is in the list.\n(4, 4) is in the list.\n(5, 3) is in the list.\n\nSo (7, 4) puts me in range of (8, 4), (9, 4), (4, 4).\n(7, 6) puts me in range of (7, 7).\n\nThe density of apples is higher in the direction of DOWN.\n\n**Move:**\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "My current position is (7, 4). I have a body of length 5. The enemy is at (5, 1) with length 4. There are several apples nearby, particularly (4, 4) and (8, 4). The enemy seems to be moving towards the top of the board (past (3, 1) and (3, 2), so likely heading UP or RIGHT), which is away from my current cluster. I need to secure food safely.\n\nMy immediate neighbors are:\n- UP (7, 5): This is currently my neck (part of my body). Moving UP would be moving directly backwards, which results in death. Unsafe.\n- DOWN (7, 3): Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (6, 4): Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT (8, 4): Contains an apple (8, 4). Safe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 4), I will eat the apple and grow.\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 4), I get closer to the (4, 4) apple cluster and the (5, 3) apple.\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 3), I move towards (7, 2), but this area has fewer immediate apples.\n\nThe map shows (6, 4) is empty.\nLooking ahead:\n- If I move LEFT to (6, 4), I can then target (5, 4) -> (4, 4).\n- If I move RIGHT to (8, 4), I might be able to target (9, 4) next, but (9, 4) is a dead end (x=9 is the edge).\n- Moving RIGHT (8, 4) puts me near the wall, which limits my long-term mobility compared to moving toward the center (6, 4).\n\nHowever, I should consider if (6, 4) is safe regarding the enemy.\nThe enemy is at (5, 1).\nCould the enemy move to (5, 2) and then (5, 3) or (5, 4)?\n(5, 3) is an apple.\nIf the enemy is at (5, 2) next turn, and I move to (6, 4) this turn, and then (5, 4) next turn, is there a collision risk?\nIf the enemy moves from (5, 1) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 3), they are heading to the apple.\nIf I go (6, 4) -> (5, 4), we are approaching from different sides of the apple at (5, 3).\nThis is risky because we might both want (5, 3) or collide at (5, 3).\nWait, (5, 3) is an apple. The enemy is at (5, 1). The distance is 2 steps. I am at (7, 4). The distance to (5, 3) is |7-5| + |4-3| = 3 steps.\nThe enemy is closer to (5, 3) than I am.\nIf the enemy moves UP twice (UP, UP), they will reach (5, 3) in 2 turns (assuming they move there now and next).\nIf I move LEFT (6, 4) and then UP/LEFT (5, 4) or (5, 3), I might arrive at the same time or after the enemy.\n\nLet's reconsider (8, 4).\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 4):\n- I eat an apple. Score increases to 5.\n- My tail stays put (length 6).\n- Next turn, I am at (8, 4). I can move to (9, 4) (another apple) or (8, 5) or (7, 4) or (8, 3).\n- (9, 4) is an apple but it's a corner (9, 4). Going to a corner is generally bad because you can get trapped.\n- However, (8, 4) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 2)... might lead to other apples?\n- The map shows (8, 2) is empty.\n- (8, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (6, 4) is the reverse path.\n\nThe best path seems to be moving towards the center where the apples are clustered.\nThe apples are at (4, 4), (5, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0).\nMoving LEFT to (6, 4) puts me in the best position to access (5, 4) and (4, 4) next turn.\nEven though the enemy is close, I have a plan.\nIf the enemy moves UP (towards me), I need to be careful.\nIf the enemy moves to (5, 2) this turn, and I am at (6, 4), I am safe.\nIf the enemy moves to (5, 3) next turn, I should avoid (5, 3).\nI can target (4, 4) instead.\n(4, 4) is an apple.\nI can go (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4).\nThe enemy would need (5, 1) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 4) or (4, 4).\nThe enemy is at y=1. I am at y=4.\nThe enemy is 3 vertical units away from me.\nIf the enemy moves UP every turn:\nTurn 11: (5, 2)\nTurn 12: (5, 3)\nTurn 13: (5, 4)\nI can eat (4, 4) on Turn 12 (if I move (6, 4)->(5, 4)->(4, 4)).\nTurn 12: I am at (4, 4).\nTurn 13: Enemy is at (5, 4) or (4, 4).\nIf I am at (4, 4) on Turn 12, and I eat, my tail doesn't move.\nMy body on Turn 12 (after eating) would be:\nHead: (4, 4)\nBody: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)] (Wait, I ate at (8, 4) or just growing? No, if I go LEFT to (6, 4), I didn't eat yet).\nLet's trace the path LEFT -> (6, 4):\nTurn 11: Move LEFT to (6, 4). No apple. Body shifts. Tail (4, 6) moves to (5, 6).\nTurn 12: Move LEFT to (5, 4). No apple? (5, 4) is empty. Body shifts. Tail (5, 6) moves to (6, 6).\nTurn 13: Move LEFT to (4, 4). Apple. Grow.\nThis is a safe path.\n\nIs there a reason to eat RIGHT (8, 4) immediately?\nEating (8, 4) gives me a point immediately.\nBut it puts me near the edge.\nIf I go LEFT, I can get two apples ((5, 3) and (4, 4)) safely.\nWait, (5, 3) is an apple.\nCan I get (5, 3)?\n(7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 3).\nThat works.\n(7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 3).\nIf I move to (5, 3), do I eat?\n(5, 3) is an apple.\nPath: (7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 3).\nThis puts me closer to the enemy.\nIf the enemy moves UP (5, 1) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 3), we collide on Turn 12 at (5, 3).\nI should avoid (5, 3) if the enemy is aiming for it.\nThe enemy is at (5, 1). They are likely chasing the apple at (5, 3).\nIf I avoid (5, 3) and go for (4, 4), I am safer.\n(4, 4) is further away from the enemy's current path (which is along x=5).\nThe enemy is at (5, 1). The vertical distance to (4, 4) is 3 units (y=1 to y=4).\nWait, (4, 4) is x=4, y=4.\nThe enemy is x=5, y=1.\nDistance from enemy to (4, 4): |5-4| + |1-4| = 4.\nDistance from me to (4, 4): |7-4| + |4-4| = 3.\nI am closer to (4, 4) than the enemy is.\nIf the enemy goes for (5, 3), they are moving away from (4, 4).\nSo (4, 4) is a safe target.\n\nHowever, if I move LEFT to (6, 4), I am preparing to move to (5, 4) next turn.\n(5, 4) is empty.\nFrom (5, 4), I can go to (4, 4).\nThis seems solid.\n\nIs there any immediate danger on LEFT?\n(6, 4) is empty.\nThe enemy cannot reach (6, 4) in one turn.\nThe enemy cannot reach (5, 4) in one turn.\nSo (6, 4) is safe for this turn.\n(5, 4) will be safe for the next turn (assuming the enemy moves UP to (5, 2) or (5, 3)).\nSo LEFT is the best move to secure the (4, 4) apple safely.\n\nLet's double check the coordinates.\n(6, 4) is Left of (7, 4).\nThe map shows (6, 4) is empty ('.').\nThe map shows (5, 4) is empty ('.').\nThe map shows (4, 4) is 'A'.\nThe map shows (3, 4) is empty.\nSo the path is clear.\n\nI will move LEFT.\n\nOne final check: What if the enemy moves diagonally? No, snakes move cardinal directions.\nWhat if the enemy moves RIGHT (6, 1)? They are chasing apples there too? (6, 1) is an apple.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT, they are moving away from me.\nIf the enemy moves UP, they are moving towards the center.\nRegardless, moving to (6, 4) is safe for this turn and sets up a good path.\n\nMove: LEFT.LEFT",

I previously moved LEFT to get here. \nWait, I am actually at (6, 4). The board state shows my head at (6, 4) in the description \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (6, 4)\".\nLet's verify the board map again.\nRow 4: `. A . . .

Blocked.\n- DOWN (6, 3): Empty ('.'). Safe.\n- LEFT (5, 4): Empty ('.'). Safe.\n- RIGHT (7, 4): Contains 'T' (My tail). Blocked.\n\nSo my options are DOWN or LEFT.\n\nLet's look at the apples and enemy.\nApples at: (4, 4), (5, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (2, 6), (0, 0), (4, 0), (9, 3), (8, 4), (2, 9), (1, 3), (1, 4), (7, 7), (9, 4), (6, 2), (8, 9).\nNearest apples to (6, 4):\n- (5, 3): Distance 2 (|6-5| + |4-3| = 2).\n- (4, 4): Distance 2 (|6-4| + |4-4| = 2).\n- (6, 2): Distance 2 (|6-6| + |4-2| = 2).\n- (8, 4): Distance 2 (|6-8| + |4-4| = 2).\n\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (6, 1). Body: [(5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)].\nThe enemy is at y=1.\nThe apples at (5, 3) and (4, 4) are at y=3 and y=4.\nThe enemy is quite far from these apples vertically.\nThe enemy might be chasing (5, 0) or (4, 0) at the bottom.\nOr (6, 2) which is close to (6, 1).\n(6, 2) is an apple.\nDistance from enemy (6, 1) to (6, 2) is 1.\nI am at (6, 4). Distance to (6, 2) is 2.\nThe enemy is closer to (6, 2).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (6, 2), they will eat it.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 3), I will be at (6, 3).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (6, 2), we are adjacent.\nIf the enemy moves UP twice (Turn 12: (6, 2), Turn 13: (6, 3)), they will collide with me at (6, 3) on Turn 13.\nHowever, on Turn 12, if I am at (6, 3) and they are at (6, 2), it is safe as long as I don't move into them or they into me.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 3), and they move UP to (6, 2), we are on adjacent columns? No, same column.\n(6, 3) and (6, 2) are vertically adjacent.\nIf we stay on these paths, on Turn 13:\nMe (6, 3) -> (6, 2)\nEnemy (6, 2) -> (6, 3)\nThis is a head-on collision. Both die.\n\nShould I avoid this?\nThe enemy is at (6, 1). My tail is at (6, 5).\nIf I go DOWN (6, 3), I am moving towards the enemy.\nIf I go LEFT (5, 4), I move away from the enemy.\nMoving LEFT to (5, 4) seems safer to avoid immediate confrontation over (6, 2).\nFrom (5, 4), I can target (4, 4) or (5, 3).\n(5, 3) is an apple.\n(5, 4) -> (5, 3) is a move.\nThe enemy is at (6, 1). The distance to (5, 3) is |6-5| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nI am at (6, 4). Distance to (5, 3) is 2.\nI am closer to (5, 3) than the enemy is.\nHowever, the enemy is closer to (6, 2).\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 4), I secure a position to eat (5, 3) or (4, 4).\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 3), I risk a collision over (6, 2) or being blocked by the enemy approaching from below.\n\nLet's check the board state again.\n(6, 2) is an apple.\nThe enemy is at (6, 1).\nIf the enemy moves UP (6, 2), they eat the apple and grow.\nIf I move DOWN (6, 3), I am at (6, 3).\nNext turn, the enemy will be at (6, 2) (assuming they eat the apple).\nI will be at (6, 3). My tail will have moved from (6, 5) to (6, 6)? No, if I didn't eat, tail moves.\nWait, if I move DOWN to (6, 3), I am not eating an apple.\nMy tail will move one step forward.\nCurrently my body: [(7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)].\nWait, the prompt says: \"Body: [(7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]\".\nThis implies my head is (6, 4), and the body connects to (7, 4)? No, head connects to (7, 4).\nWait, the list is \"Head-to-tail\".\nHead: (6, 4).\nBody: (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6).\nThis seems geometrically impossible.\n(6, 4) connects to (7, 4)? That's to the RIGHT.\n(7, 4) connects to (7, 5)? That's UP.\n(7, 5) connects to (6, 5)? That's LEFT.\n(6, 5) connects to (6, 6)? That's UP.\n\nLet's look at the map again.\nRow 4: `. A . . . A . 0 T A A` at x=6,7,8,9.\n(6, 4) is '0'.\n(7, 4) is 'T'.\n(8, 4) is 'A'.\n(9, 4) is 'A'.\nRow 5: `. . . . . . T T . .`\n(6, 5) is 'T'.\n(7, 5) is 'T'.\nRow 6: `. . A . . . T . . .`\n(6, 6) is 'T'.\n\nSo the snake is:\nHead: (6, 4)\nTail 1: (7, 4)\nTail 2: (7, 5)\nTail 3: (6, 5)\nTail 4: (6, 6)\n\nThis path is: (6, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6).\nThis is a valid snake shape (a 'C' shape).\nSo I cannot move UP (into (6, 5)).\nI cannot move RIGHT (into (7, 4)).\nI can move DOWN (6, 3) or LEFT (5, 4).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 3):\nI am moving towards the enemy (6, 1).\nThe apple at (6, 2) is in the way.\nIf the enemy eats (6, 2), they grow.\nIf I try to get (6, 2), I am 2 steps away, enemy is 1 step away.\nI should not compete for (6, 2).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 4):\nI move towards the cluster of apples at (4, 4), (5, 3), (4, 4).\nThe enemy is at (6, 1). The distance to (5, 3) is 3.\nI am at (6, 4). The distance to (5, 3) is 2.\nI am closer.\nAlso, (5, 4) is safer as it moves me away from the enemy's likely path UP along x=6.\n\nLet's consider the enemy's options.\nEnemy at (6, 1). Body at (5, 1), (4, 1)...\nPossible moves: UP (6, 2), DOWN (6, 0), LEFT (5, 1 - blocked by body), RIGHT (7, 1).\nDOWN (6, 0) is an apple? (6, 0) is '.'.\nUP (6, 2) is an apple.\nRIGHT (7, 1) is '.'.\nMost likely the enemy will move UP to (6, 2) to eat the apple.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (6, 2), they will be at (6, 2).\nMy move LEFT to (5, 4) puts me at (5, 4).\nDistance between us: |5-6| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3. Safe.\nNext turn, I can move to (5, 3) or (4, 4).\nThe enemy will be at (6, 2).\nIf I go to (5, 3), distance is |5-6| + |3-2| = 2. Safe.\nIf the enemy goes to (6, 3), distance is |5-6| + |3-3| = 1.\nIf the enemy goes to (5, 2), distance is |5-5| + |3-2| = 1.\nWe would be adjacent.\nBut (5, 3) is an apple. I should eat it.\nThe enemy is at (6, 2). To block me from (5, 3), they would need to move to (5, 3).\nDistance from (6, 2) to (5, 3) is 2.\nDistance from (5, 4) to (5, 3) is 1.\nI am faster.\nI can eat (5, 3) on Turn 13 if I move to (5, 4) on Turn 12.\nOn Turn 12, if I move LEFT to (5, 4), I don't eat.\nOn Turn 13, I move to (5, 3) and eat.\nThe enemy, starting at (6, 1), needs 2 turns to reach (5, 3) (Turn 12: (6, 2), Turn 13: (5, 3)).\nIf the enemy moves (6, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 2) -> (6, 3) ... it's slower.\nIf the enemy moves (6, 1) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 4) ... they hit my body at (6, 4) on Turn 14? My head will be at (5, 3) on Turn 13. On Turn 14, I will move to (4, 3) or (5, 2) or (4, 3).\nMy tail on Turn 13 (after eating at 5,3) will be at (6, 6) -> (6, 7)? No, if I don't eat on Turn 12, tail moves to (6, 7)? No, tail moves forward.\nLet's trace tail.\nTurn 11: I was at (7, 4). Tail end (6, 6).\nTurn 12 (Move LEFT to 5, 4): Head (5, 4). Tail end becomes (7, 5)? No, body shifts.\nBody: (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 5) -> (6, 5).\nTail end (6, 6) is vacated.\nTurn 13 (Move to 5, 3): Head (5, 3). Eat.\nBody: (5, 3) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 5) -> (6, 5).\nTail stays at (6, 5).\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (5, 4) is the best setup to eat (5, 3) safely.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN?\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 3), I am at (6, 3).\nThe enemy is likely at (6, 2).\nWe are adjacent vertically.\nIf I then move to (5, 3), I eat.\nThe enemy could move to (6, 3).\nIf I am at (6, 3) and move to (5, 3), and enemy is at (6, 2) and moves to (6, 3), we are at (5, 3) and (6, 3). No collision.\nBut if the enemy moves to (5, 2) and I move to (5, 3), we are adjacent.\nIt's riskier to be on the same column as the enemy.\nMoving LEFT puts me on a different column (x=5) while the enemy is at x=6 (mostly).\nThis creates separation.\n\nDecision:\nMove LEFT to (5, 4). This avoids the immediate confrontation over (6, 2) and positions me perfectly for (5, 3) and (4, 4).\n\nOne detail: (5, 4) is empty. Checked.\n(6, 4) is safe to leave.\n(5, 4) is safe to enter.\n\nFinal check on win conditions. We are tied 4-4.\nI need to eat safely.\nLEFT is the move.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

This forms a small enclosed area at (6, 6) that I must be careful not to enter if I cannot leave.\n\nThe board shows apples at (4, 8), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 3), (2, 6), etc.\n\nNearby, I see an apple at (5, 3) which is just below my body segment at (5, 4). However, (5, 3) is currently occupied by the tail of snake #1? Let me check the board state carefully.\n\nThe board text shows:\nRow 5 (y=5): \". . . . . . T T A .\"  (T is tail of snake #1, A is apple)\nRow 4 (y=4): \". A . . 0 T T T A A\" (0 is my head, T is tail, A is apple)\nRow 3 (y=3): \". A . . . A 1 . . A\" (1 is enemy head)\nRow 2 (y=2): \". . . . . . T . . .\" (T is tail)\n\nSo at (5, 3), the board shows 'A' (apple). Snake #1's tail appears to be at (6, 5) based on the board, but the data says Snake #1's body is [(6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1)]. There is a discrepancy between the ASCII board and the coordinate lists. The ASCII board is a snapshot of the current turn. The coordinate lists are also provided. I must trust the coordinate lists for collision checks as they represent the actual entity positions. However, the ASCII board provides apple locations which are usually accurate. I should trust the provided apple list: `Apples at: (2, 6), (0, 0), (4, 0), (9, 3), (8, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (2, 9), (1, 3), (1, 4), (7, 7), (9, 4), (8, 9), (4, 8), (8, 5)`.\n\nLet's look at (5, 3). The apple list includes (5, 3). Is it blocked?\nMy body is at (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4). So (5, 3) is not in my body.\nEnemy #1 body is at (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1). So (5, 3) is not in enemy #1's body.\nTherefore, (5, 3) is a valid target.\n\nLet's evaluate my moves from (4, 4):\n1.  **UP** to (4, 5): The ASCII board shows 'T' at (4, 5). The coordinate list for Snake #1 is `(6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1)`. Wait, the enemy head is (6, 3). The body is listed. There is no tail listed in the prompt text \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1)]\". This implies the tail is at (3, 1).\n    However, looking at the ASCII board, the 'T' at (4, 5) is part of the visual representation of *my* tail? No, looking at the ASCII board row 4: \". A . . 0 T T T A A\".\n    The '0' is at (4, 4).\n    The 'T's are at (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4).\n    Row 5: \". . . . . . T T A .\".\n    The 'T's at (6, 5) and (7, 5) are my tail. The 'T' at (6, 6)? No, the last 'T' in row 4 is at (7, 4).\n    Let's map my body again.\n    My Head: (4, 4).\n    Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5)].\n    The ASCII board is consistent with this (mostly).\n    (5, 4) -> T\n    (6, 4) -> T\n    (7, 4) -> T\n    (7, 5) -> T (Row 5, col 7 is T)\n    (6, 5) -> T (Row 5, col 6 is T)\n    So my body occupies (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5).\n    Move UP to (4, 5):\n    Is (4, 5) in my body? No.\n    Is (4, 5) in Enemy #1 body? Enemy body: (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1). No.\n    Is (4, 5) an apple? Yes, (4, 8) is an apple, but (4, 5) is not in the apple list. Wait, let's check the ASCII board again.\n    Row 5: \". . . . . . T T A .\"\n    Columns: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n    (4, 5) is empty ('.'). So moving UP to (4, 5) is safe and does not eat an apple immediately (unless the apple list is wrong about the coordinates, but usually ASCII is correct for apples).\n    Actually, checking the prompt's apple list: `(4, 8), (5, 3)`.\n    (4, 5) is empty space. Moving to empty space is safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN** to (4, 3):\n    My body: (4, 4) is head currently, moving to (4, 3).\n    Is (4, 3) in my body? No.\n    Is (4, 3) in Enemy #1 body? No.\n    Is (4, 3) an apple? The board shows '.' at (4, 3). The apple list does not include (4, 3).\n    So (4, 3) is empty. Safe.\n\n3.  **LEFT** to (3, 4):\n    My body: No.\n    Enemy body: No.\n    Apple? Board shows '.' at (3, 4). Safe.\n\n4.  **RIGHT** to (5, 4):\n    My body: YES, (5, 4) is the first segment of my body.\n    Moving into my own body is death. **RIGHT is invalid.**\n\nSo valid moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the apples.\nApple at (5, 3).\nApple at (4, 8).\nApple at (2, 6).\nApple at (5, 0).\n\nFrom (4, 4):\n- To (5, 3): Distance is |5-4| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- To (4, 8): Distance is |4-4| + |8-4| = 0 + 4 = 4.\n- To (2, 6): Distance is |2-4| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n- To (5, 0): Distance is |5-4| + |0-4| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nThe closest apple is (5, 3). To reach (5, 3), I need to move to (5, 4) then (5, 3). But (5, 4) is currently blocked by my body. Wait, if I move UP to (4, 5) or LEFT to (3, 4) or DOWN to (4, 3), my tail will move.\nMy tail is at (6, 5). The body is [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5)].\nIf I move UP (4, 5):\nNew Head: (4, 5).\nNew Body: [(4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)].\nTail moves from (6, 5) to (6, 4) (wait, the previous tail is (6, 5). The new body is head + old body. The last element of the new body is the 2nd to last of the old body.\nOld body: (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5).\nNew body: (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5).\nNew Tail: (7, 5).\nSo (6, 5) becomes free. (5, 4) is still occupied.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 3):\nNew Head: (4, 3).\nNew Body: [(4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)].\nNew Tail: (7, 5).\n(6, 5) becomes free. (5, 4) is still occupied.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 4):\nNew Head: (3, 4).\nNew Body: [(3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)].\nNew Tail: (7, 5).\n(6, 5) becomes free. (5, 4) is still occupied.\n\nSo in all valid moves, (5, 4) remains occupied by my body in the next turn.\nThis means I cannot reach (5, 3) in the next turn. I would need two turns.\nTurn 1: Move to (4, 5), (4, 3), or (3, 4).\nTurn 2: Move to (5, 4) (if it opens up).\nWait, if I move UP to (4, 5), the body becomes (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)...\nSo (5, 4) is occupied in the next turn too.\nHowever, if I move DOWN to (4, 3), the body is (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4)...\nStill (5, 4) occupied.\n\nLet's look at the other apples.\nApple at (4, 8). From (4, 4), this is straight up. It's a distance of 4.\nApple at (2, 6). Distance 4.\nApple at (5, 0). Distance 5.\n\nLet's look at the Enemy Snake #1.\nHead: (6, 3).\nBody: (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1).\nApples near enemy:\n(5, 3) is 2 steps away from enemy (6, 3) -> (5, 3).\n(5, 0) is 4 steps away.\n(2, 6) is 5 steps away.\n(4, 8) is 6 steps away.\n\nThe enemy is very close to (5, 3). If I try to go for (5, 3), I am competing directly. The enemy can take it in 1 move (LEFT to (5, 3)). If the enemy takes it, it grows. If I move towards it, I might run into the enemy or get cut off.\nLet's calculate the timing.\nIf I move UP to (4, 5), I am further from (5, 3).\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 3), I am closer to (5, 3).\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 4), I am further from (5, 3).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 3):\nMy position: (4, 3).\nEnemy position: (6, 3).\nDistance to apple (5, 3): 1.\nDistance for enemy to (5, 3): 2.\nI am closer. But the enemy is at (6, 3). If I go to (4, 3), I am safe.\nNext turn, I can move to (5, 3).\nCan the enemy intercept?\nIf I am at (4, 3) and enemy at (6, 3).\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (5, 3).\nI move RIGHT to (5, 3).\nResult: Head-on collision. Both die.\nThis is bad.\n\nWhat if I go for (4, 8)?\nIt's far, but safer from the enemy.\nThe enemy is at (6, 3). (4, 8) is far away.\nLet's see what other apples are available.\nApple at (7, 7). Distance: |7-4| + |7-4| = 6.\nApple at (8, 5). Distance: |8-4| + |5-4| = 5.\nApple at (9, 4). Distance: |9-4| + |4-4| = 5.\nApple at (2, 6). Distance: 4.\n\nLet's look at the board state constraints.\nMy body forms a shape. I am at (4, 4).\nIf I move UP to (4, 5), I am at (4, 5). My body blocks (5, 4).\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 4), I am at (3, 4).\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 3), I am at (4, 3).\n\nLet's consider the \"Head-on collision\" risk with (5, 3).\nThe enemy is at (6, 3). The apple is at (5, 3).\nThe enemy will likely move LEFT to (5, 3) to eat the apple.\nIf I also move towards (5, 3), I might die.\nSo (5, 3) is a trap.\n\nWhat about (4, 0), (5, 0)? These are at the bottom.\nDistance from (4, 4) to (4, 0) is 4.\nDistance from (6, 3) to (4, 0) is |6-4| + |3-0| = 5.\nDistance from (6, 3) to (5, 0) is |6-5| + |3-0| = 4.\nSo the enemy is closer to (5, 0) than I am to (4, 0).\nBut (4, 0) is an apple.\n\nLet's look at the ASCII board again.\nRow 0: \"A . . . A A . . . .\"\nApples at (0,0), (4,0), (5,0).\nRow 1: \". . . T T T T . . .\" (Snake #1 tail)\nRow 2: \". . . . . . T . . .\" (Snake #1 tail? No, Snake #1 body ends at (3, 1). The 'T' at (6, 2) is... wait, the prompt says Snake #1 body is `[(6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1)]`.\nSo (6, 2) is the body segment next to the head.\nThe ASCII board shows (6, 2) as 'T'.\nThis is consistent.\n\nLet's check (4, 8) again.\nApple at (4, 8).\nIs it reachable?\nFrom (4, 4) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 7) -> (4, 8).\nIs the path clear?\nRow 5: \". . . . . . T T A .\" at y=5. x=4 is '.'.\nRow 6: \". . A . . . . . . .\" at y=6. x=4 is '.'.\nRow 7: \". . . . . . . A . .\" at y=7. x=4 is '.'.\nRow 8: \". . . . A . . . . .\" at y=8. x=4 is 'A'.\nThe path to (4, 8) looks clear of obstacles (snakes).\nThe enemy is at (6, 3). He is far from (4, 8).\nThe distance for enemy to (4, 8) is |6-4| + |3-8| = 2 + 5 = 7.\nMy distance is 4.\nI can reach it in 4 turns.\nThe enemy can reach it in 7 turns.\nI can safely eat (4, 8) without interference.\n\nLet's compare (4, 8) with (2, 6).\nApple at (2, 6).\nPath: (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6).\nCheck obstacles.\n(3, 4) is empty ('.').\n(2, 4) is empty ('.').\n(2, 5) is empty ('.').\n(2, 6) has an apple.\nDistance: 4.\nEnemy distance to (2, 6): |6-2| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7.\nAlso safe.\n\nWhich one is better?\n(4, 8) is straight up. (2, 6) is left and up.\nMy current body is oriented to the right/down.\nMoving UP to (4, 5) keeps my body relatively straight.\nMoving LEFT to (3, 4) starts a turn.\nIf I go for (4, 8), I move UP.\nIf I go for (2, 6), I move LEFT.\n\nLet's look at the board for (4, 8).\nRow 8: \". . . . A . . . . .\"\nSo (4, 8) is safe to reach.\nRow 5, x=4 is '.'.\nRow 6, x=4 is '.'.\nRow 7, x=4 is '.'.\n\nIs there any risk of the enemy cutting me off?\nThe enemy is at (6, 3).\nI am at (4, 4).\nIf I move UP to (4, 5).\nEnemy will likely move to (5, 3) to eat the apple, or perhaps UP if he sees (4, 8).\nBut (6, 3) -> (6, 4) is blocked by my body at (6, 4).\nSo the enemy cannot go UP. He must go LEFT to (5, 3) or DOWN to (6, 2).\nHe is very likely to go for the apple at (5, 3).\nIf he goes (6, 3) -> (5, 3), he grows.\nThis makes him longer.\nWhile he is distracted by (5, 3), I can secure (4, 8).\n\nIs there a better apple?\nApple at (7, 7). Distance 6. Blocked by my body at (7, 4), (7, 5).\nApple at (8, 5). Distance 5.\nApple at (9, 4). Distance 5.\nApple at (9, 3). Distance 5.\n\nLet's look at (8, 5) or (9, 4).\nPath to (9, 4): (4, 4) -> (5, 4) ... wait, (5, 4) is blocked by my body.\nI need to clear (5, 4) first.\nTo clear (5, 4), I need to move my head away from it so the tail can slide forward.\nCurrent body: (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5).\nIf I move UP to (4, 5):\nNew body: (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5).\n(5, 4) is still occupied.\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 3):\nNew body: (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5).\n(5, 4) is still occupied.\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 4):\nNew body: (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5).\n(5, 4) is still occupied.\n\nIt seems I am stuck behind my own body for the immediate next turn.\nThis means I cannot move RIGHT immediately.\nI must move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nMoving UP to (4, 5) or DOWN to (4, 3) or LEFT to (3, 4).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"Head-on collision\" risk.\nIf I go for (4, 8), I need to go UP.\nIf I go for (2, 6), I need to go LEFT.\n\nLet's check (4, 5) again.\nIs (4, 5) safe?\nMy body: No.\nEnemy body: No.\nApple: No.\nSo it's safe.\n\nIs (3, 4) safe?\nMy body: No.\nEnemy body: No.\nApple: No.\nSo it's safe.\n\nIs (4, 3) safe?\nMy body: No.\nEnemy body: No.\nApple: No.\nSo it's safe.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 4: \". A . . 0 T T T A A\"\nWait, the apples at (4, 4) are not there. My head is there.\nApples are at (8, 4) and (9, 4).\nRow 5: \". . . . . . T T A .\"\nApple at (8, 5).\nRow 6: \". . A . . . . . . .\"\nApple at (2, 6).\nRow 8: \". . . . A . . . . .\"\nApple at (4, 8).\n\nLet's look at (2, 6).\nPath: (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6).\nCheck obstacles on this path.\n(3, 4): Empty.\n(2, 4): Empty.\n(2, 5): Empty.\n(2, 6): Apple.\nSeems safe.\nDistance is 4.\n\nLet's look at (4, 8).\nPath: (4, 4) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 7) -> (4, 8).\nCheck obstacles.\n(4, 5): Empty.\n(4, 6): Empty.\n(4, 7): Empty.\n(4, 8): Apple.\nSeems safe.\nDistance is 4.\n\nLet's look at (8, 5).\nPath: (4, 4) -> ... -> (8, 5).\nDistance is 5.\nPath: (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 5).\nCheck obstacles.\n(5, 4) is blocked by my body.\nSo I cannot start this path immediately.\nI would have to clear (5, 4) first.\nIf I move UP to (4, 5) or LEFT to (3, 4), I clear the path for the tail, but (5, 4) remains occupied for one more turn.\nActually, if I move UP to (4, 5):\nBody becomes (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5).\nIf I then move RIGHT to (5, 5):\nBody becomes (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4).\nThis requires 2 turns to get to (5, 5). From (5, 5) to (8, 5) is 3 steps.\nTotal 5 turns.\n(4, 8) takes 4 turns.\n(2, 6) takes 4 turns.\n\nWhy is (4, 8) potentially better?\nIt's in the top left corner.\nThe enemy is at (6, 3).\nThe enemy has apples at (5, 3), (5, 0), (4, 0), (0, 0).\nIf I go to (4, 8), I am moving to a corner where the enemy is less likely to be initially.\nAlso, (4, 8) is a single apple. Once eaten, I might turn towards (2, 9) or (4, 0).\n(2, 9) is at the top left corner.\n(4, 0) is at the bottom left.\n\nLet's consider the enemy's move.\nThe enemy is at (6, 3).\nApple at (5, 3).\nApple at (6, 2) is NOT an apple. The board shows 'T' at (6, 2) (Snake #1 body).\nApple at (6, 1) is NOT an apple. (Snake #1 body).\nApple at (5, 1) is NOT an apple.\nApple at (4, 1) is NOT an apple.\nApple at (3, 1) is NOT an apple.\nApple at (1, 3) is an apple. Distance: |6-1| + |3-3| = 5.\nApple at (1, 4) is an apple. Distance: |6-1| + |3-4| = 6.\nApple at (5, 3) is the closest.\nApple at (5, 0) is an apple. Distance: |6-5| + |3-0| = 4.\nApple at (4, 0) is an apple. Distance: |6-4| + |3-0| = 5.\nApple at (0, 0) is an apple. Distance: 9.\n\nSo the enemy's priority is likely (5, 3) (dist 2), then (5, 0) (dist 4).\nIf the enemy goes for (5, 3), he moves LEFT to (5, 3).\nIf I move UP to (4, 5), I am safe.\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 3), I am close to the enemy but not in collision range immediately (distance 1).\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 4), I am safe.\n\nIf the enemy takes (5, 3), he grows.\nI should avoid competing for (5, 3).\n(5, 3) is risky because if I go for it, it's a race.\nMy distance to (5, 3) is 2 (via (5, 4) which is blocked, or (4, 3) -> (5, 3)).\nWait, from (4, 4), I can go to (4, 3), then (5, 3).\nIf I go (4, 4) -> (4, 3).\nEnemy goes (6, 3) -> (5, 3).\nI am at (4, 3). Enemy is at (5, 3).\nDistance between us is 1.\nNext turn:\nI can go (4, 3) -> (5, 3). But enemy is there. Collision.\nI can go (4, 3) -> (4, 2) or (4, 4) or (3, 3).\nIf I go to (5, 3), I die (enemy body is there).\nSo if the enemy takes (5, 3), I cannot take it the next turn.\nUnless I am faster.\nEnemy is 1 step away. I am 2 steps away.\nEnemy will definitely take it.\nSo I should NOT go for (5, 3).\n\nTherefore, I should move away from (5, 3).\nUP or LEFT are good choices.\nDOWN brings me closer to (5, 3) and the enemy, which is dangerous.\n\nLet's compare UP and LEFT.\nIf I go UP to (4, 5):\nI can target (4, 8) or (2, 6) or (5, 0) or (4, 0).\nFrom (4, 5), distance to (4, 8) is 3.\nDistance to (2, 6) is |2-4| + |6-5| = 3.\nDistance to (5, 0) is |5-4| + |0-5| = 6.\nDistance to (4, 0) is 5.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 4):\nDistance to (4, 8) is |4-3| + |8-4| = 5.\nDistance to (2, 6) is |2-3| + |6-4| = 3.\nDistance to (5, 0) is 6.\nDistance to (4, 0) is 5.\n\n(4, 8) is a straight line from (4, 5).\n(2, 6) is accessible from both.\nHowever, (4, 8) is in a corner. (2, 6) is on the left side.\nThe enemy is on the right side (x=6).\nIf I go UP, I stay on the left side (x=4).\nIf I go LEFT, I go further left (x=3).\n\nLet's look at the board for (4, 5).\nRow 5: \". . . . . . T T A .\"\n(4, 5) is empty.\nIs there any apple nearby?\n(4, 8) is up.\n(5, 3) is down-right (occupied by enemy likely).\n(5, 0) is far.\n(4, 0) is far.\n\nLet's look at the board for (3, 4).\nRow 4: \". A . . 0 T T T A A\"\n(3, 4) is empty ('.').\nIs there any apple nearby?\n(2, 6) is up-left.\n(5, 3) is right-down.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 4), I am opening up the path to (2, 6) and (2, 9).\nIf I go UP to (4, 5), I am opening up the path to (4, 8) and (4, 0).\n(4, 0) is an apple.\nPath to (4, 0) from (4, 5): (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 0).\nIs this path clear?\n(4, 4) will be my body (if I go UP to (4, 5), my body includes (4, 4)).\n(4, 3) is empty.\n(4, 2) is empty ('.' at (4, 2)).\n(4, 1) is 'T' (Snake #1 body at (4, 1)).\nAh, (4, 1) is occupied by Snake #1's body.\nSo I cannot eat (4, 0) easily. I would have to go around (4, 1).\nGoing around (4, 1) to get to (4, 0) is possible but risky if the enemy is nearby.\n(4, 0) is at the bottom left corner.\nEnemy is at (6, 3).\nIf the enemy moves towards (5, 0) or (4, 0), it might be a race.\n\nLet's consider (2, 6) again.\nFrom (4, 4), going LEFT to (3, 4) is the first step.\n(2, 6) is an apple.\nPath: (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6).\nIs (2, 4) empty? Yes ('.' on row 4).\nIs (2, 5) empty? Yes ('.' on row 5).\nIs (2, 6) an apple? Yes.\nThis path is clear.\nDistance is 3 moves from (3, 4).\nTotal moves from (4, 4) is 4.\n\nWhat about (2, 9)?\nApple at (2, 9).\nFrom (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6) -> (2, 7) -> (2, 8) -> (2, 9).\nThis is a long path. 7 moves.\n\nWhat about (4, 8)?\nFrom (4, 4) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 7) -> (4, 8).\nThis is 4 moves.\nPath is clear.\n(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7) are all empty.\n\nSo (4, 8) and (2, 6) are both 4 moves away.\n(4, 8) is straight UP.\n(2, 6) is LEFT then UP.\n\nWhich is safer?\nEnemy is at (6, 3).\nIf I go UP to (4, 5), I am moving away from the enemy.\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 4), I am moving away from the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apples available near (4, 8) vs (2, 6).\nNear (4, 8): (2, 9) is nearby. (8, 9) is far.\nNear (2, 6): (1, 3), (1, 4) are nearby (but on the left side).\nWait, (1, 3) and (1, 4) are apples.\nRow 3: \". A . . . A 1 . . A\"\n(1, 3) is 'A'.\nRow 4: \". A . . 0 T T T A A\"\n(1, 4) is 'A'.\nThese are on the far left.\nIf I go to (2, 6), I am closer to (1, 3) and (1, 4).\nIf I go to (4, 8), I am closer to (4, 0) and (5, 0) (but blocked by snake #1 body) and (2, 9).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"blocked by snake #1 body\" for (4, 0).\nSnake #1 body is at (4, 1).\nTo get to (4, 0), I must go through (4, 1) or go around.\nGoing around (4, 1) would require going to (5, 0) or (3, 0).\n(5, 0) is an apple.\n(3, 0) is empty ('.' at (3, 0)).\nSo path to (4, 0) could be: ... -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0).\nOr path to (5, 0): ... -> (4, 0) -> (5, 0).\nBut (4, 1) blocks the direct vertical path.\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 5), I am committing to the top of the board.\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 4), I am committing to the left side.\n\nLet's look at the board state one more time.\nSnake #1 body: (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1).\nSnake #1 Head: (6, 3).\nApples: (5, 3), (5, 0), (4, 0), (0, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 6), (4, 8), (2, 9), etc.\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 5), I am safe.\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 4), I am safe.\n\nIs there an apple I can reach faster than the enemy?\n(2, 6): Dist 4 for me. Dist 7 for enemy.\n(4, 8): Dist 4 for me. Dist 7 for enemy.\n(5, 0): Dist 5 for me. Dist 4 for enemy. (Enemy is faster).\n(4, 0): Dist 5 for me. Dist 5 for enemy. (Tie, but enemy has obstacles).\n(1, 3): Dist |1-4| + |3-4| = 4. Enemy dist |6-1| + |3-3| = 5.\n(1, 4): Dist |1-4| + |4-4| = 3. Enemy dist |6-1| + |3-4| = 6.\n\nSo (1, 4) is very close! Dist 3.\nPath to (1, 4):\n(4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4).\nCheck path:\n(3, 4) is empty.\n(2, 4) is empty.\n(1, 4) is apple.\nIs (1, 4) safe?\nRow 4: \". A . . 0 T T T A A\"\n(1, 4) is 'A'.\nIs it blocked? No.\nSo (1, 4) is a very good target. It's closer than (2, 6) or (4, 8).\nDistance 3.\n\nWhat about (1, 3)?\nDistance 4.\n(4, 8) is distance 4.\n\nSo the best apple is (1, 4).\nTarget: (1, 4).\nPath: (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4).\nFirst move: LEFT to (3, 4).\n\nIs there any risk?\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 4), I am moving left.\nThe enemy is at (6, 3).\nThe enemy might move to (5, 3) (apple).\nThe enemy might move to (6, 2) or (6, 1) (body parts, not apples).\nThe enemy might move to (6, 4) (blocked by my body at (6, 4)).\nSo the enemy is likely to move LEFT or DOWN.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 3), he grows.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 2), he stays same size.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 4), I am safe from the enemy.\nI am moving towards (1, 4).\n(1, 4) is an apple.\nAfter eating (1, 4), I can go for (1, 3) or (2, 6) or (0, 0).\n(0, 0) is an apple. Distance from (1, 4) is |0-1| + |0-4| = 5.\n(2, 6) is an apple. Distance from (1, 4) is |2-1| + |6-4| = 3.\n(1, 3) is an apple. Distance from (1, 4) is 1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Move LEFT to (3, 4).\n2. Move LEFT to (2, 4).\n3. Move LEFT to (1, 4) (Eat apple).\n4. Move DOWN to (1, 3) (Eat apple).\n5. From (1, 3), go to (2, 6) or (0, 0).\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. It targets the closest apples and avoids the enemy.\n\nLet's double check if any move kills me.\nLEFT to (3, 4):\nIs (3, 4) in my body? No.\nIs (3, 4) in enemy body? No.\nIs (3, 4) off board? No.\nIs (3, 4) backwards? No (I came from (4, 4)).\nIs (3, 4) an apple? No (but that's fine).\nIs (3, 4) an enemy head? No (Enemy is at (6, 3)).\nIs (3, 4) an enemy body? No.\nIs (3, 4) blocked by anything else? No.\n\nSo LEFT is safe.\n\nWhat about UP to (4, 5)?\nSafe, but leads to (4, 8) which is further away than (1, 4).\nAlso (4, 5) is empty.\n(4, 8) is an apple.\n(1, 4) is closer.\n\nWhat about DOWN to (4, 3)?\nSafe, but leads towards (5, 3) which is contested.\nAlso leads to (4, 0) which is blocked by (4, 1).\nSo DOWN is worse than LEFT.\n\nWhat about RIGHT to (5, 4)?\nKills me. Invalid.\n\nSo LEFT is the best move.\n\nLet's write the rationale.\nI am at (4, 4).\nTargeting (1, 4) is the closest apple (distance 3).\nPath is clear: (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4).\nMoving LEFT to (3, 4) starts this path.\nThis avoids the enemy at (6, 3) and the contested apple at (5, 3).\n\nWait, I should check if (2, 4) is empty.\nRow 4: \". A . . 0 T T T A A\"\nCols: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(2, 4) is '.' (empty).\n(1, 4) is 'A' (apple).\n(3, 4) is '.' (empty).\n\nCheck (1, 4) again.\nIs it safe to land on?\nYes, it's an apple.\nIs there an enemy head moving there?\nEnemy head is (6, 3).\nDistance to (1, 4) is 5 + 1 = 6. Impossible to reach in 1 turn.\nSo (1, 4) is safe to eat.\n\nIs there a risk of the enemy blocking me?\nNo, the enemy is far away.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves to (5, 3) and grows?\nThat's fine. I am getting an apple too.\nI need to make sure I don't get trapped.\nIf I go to (3, 4), my body will be (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5).\nThis is an open shape.\n\nFinal check on the apple list.\nApples at: (1, 4).\nYes.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nOne detail: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nMy head is at (4, 4).\nMy body is at (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5).\nThe cell behind my head (where I came from) is... I don't know where I came from exactly, but it's not (3, 4).\nSo it's fine.\n\nI will formulate the plan.\nPlan: Go to (1, 4) to eat the apple. Then go to (1, 3) to eat the other apple.\nFirst step: LEFT to (3, 4).\n\nDouble check the apple at (1, 4).\nThe board row 4: \". A . . 0 T T T A A\"\n(1, 4) is 'A'.\nThe apple list includes (1, 4).\nConfirmed.\n\nDouble check the apple at (1, 3).\nThe board row 3: \". A . . . A 1 . . A\"\n(1, 3) is 'A'.\nThe apple list includes (1, 3).\nConfirmed.\n\nSo the target is good.\n\nWhat about (0, 0)?\nIt's an apple. Distance from (4, 4) is 4 + 4 = 8.\nIt's a long way.\n\nWhat about (2, 9)?\nDistance 2 + 5 = 7.\n\n(1, 4) is definitely the closest safe apple.\n\nIs there any apple closer?\n(5, 3) is distance 2.\nBut it's contested.\n(4, 5) is empty.\n(5, 0) is distance 5.\n(4, 0) is distance 5.\n(2, 6) is distance 4.\n(1, 3) is distance 4.\n(1, 4) is distance 3.\n\nSo (1, 4) is the closest.\n\nFinal check on safety of (3, 4).\nEnemy head (6, 3).\nIf enemy moves UP to (6, 4) -> blocked by my body at (6, 4). He dies.\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (5, 3) -> eats apple, grows.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (6, 2) -> hits own body? No, (6, 2) is his body. He dies if he hits own body.\nWait, rules: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\nSo if enemy moves to (6, 2), he dies.\nSo enemy will likely move LEFT to (5, 3).\nThis is the most logical move for him.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 4), I am safe from him.\nHe is safe at (5, 3) (assuming it's empty).\nIs (5, 3) empty?\nApple list says (5, 3) is an apple.\nBoard says (5, 3) is 'A'.\nSo it's an apple, not a body.\nSo he can safely eat it.\n\nSo both of us can make safe moves.\n\nI am confident in LEFT.\n\nOne more thing: The prompt says \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nMy head is at (4, 4).\nLEFT decreases X. So (3, 4) is correct.\n\nI will write the rationale and the move.I am currently at (4, 4). My immediate goal is to secure the closest safe apple to maintain my lead. The apple at (5, 3) is contested; the enemy snake is only one move away from it, while I am two moves away and would likely die in a head-on collision if I race for it. The apples at (4, 0) and (5, 0) are blocked by the enemy's body segments and are further away. The apple at (1, 4) is the closest reachable apple (distance of 3) and is safe from the enemy, who is too far away to intercept. The path to (1, 4) is clear: (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4). Moving LEFT to (3, 4) starts this safe route, avoids the enemy, and keeps my options open for the subsequent apple at (1, 3).\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake #1 is at (5,2) with body segments around that area. Let me map out the board accurately based on the visual representation.\n\nLooking at the board display:\nRow 9: . . A . . . . . A .\nRow 8: . . . . A . . . . .\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A . .\nRow 6: . . A . . . . . . .\nRow 5: . . A . . . . . A .\nRow 4: . A 0 T T T T T A A  (My head at (2,4), body T's at (3,4)-(7,4), apples at (1,4), (8,4), (9,4))\nRow 3: . A . . . T T . . A  (Enemy body at (5,3)-(6,3), apple at (9,3), apple at (1,3)?)\nRow 2: . . . . . 1 T . . .  (Enemy head at (5,2), body at (6,2))\nRow 1: . . . . T T T . . .  (Enemy body at (4,1)-(6,1))\nRow 0: A . . . A A . . . .  (Apples at (0,0), (4,0), (5,0))\n\nWait, let me check the apple list: (2,6), (0,0), (4,0), (9,3), (8,4), (5,0), (2,9), (1,3), (1,4), (7,7), (9,4), (8,9), (4,8), (8,5), (2,5)\n\nMy current position: (2,4). My body: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4).\n\nLet me identify immediate threats:\n1. My own body: I cannot move RIGHT (into (3,4) which is my body) and cannot move LEFT from (2,4) because that would be moving backwards into my body at (3,4)? Actually no, moving LEFT from (2,4) goes to (1,4). My body is to my RIGHT (x=3). So I cannot move RIGHT.\n\n2. Enemy snake: Enemy head at (5,2), body at (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). They are far away from me.\n\n3. Apples near me: (1,4) is directly to my LEFT, (1,3) is DOWN-LEFT from (2,4), (2,5) is UP from (2,4).\n\nLet me evaluate each move:\n\nUP: (2,5) - There's an apple at (2,5)! That's great. But I need to check if it's safe. (2,5) is not occupied by any snake body currently. The enemy is at (5,2) far away. This seems safe and gives me an apple immediately.\n\nDOWN: (2,3) - This is empty (no apple, no snake bodies visible). It's safe but doesn't give me an apple.\n\nLEFT: (1,4) - There's an apple at (1,4)! Also safe. The enemy is far away.\n\nRIGHT: (3,4) - This is my own body segment, so I would die. Not allowed.\n\nSo both UP and LEFT give me apples. Which is better?\n\nUP to (2,5):\n- Immediate apple +1 point\n- Position (2,5) - let me think about future options from there\n- From (2,5), I could go to (2,6) which has an apple, or (1,5), (3,5)\n- But need to check if (3,5) is safe - my body is at (3,4), (4,4), etc. (3,5) is not part of my body currently\n- However, (2,5) is adjacent to my own body at (3,4) if the enemy moves cleverly...\n\nLEFT to (1,4):\n- Immediate apple +1 point\n- Position (1,4) - from there I could go to (1,3) which has an apple, or (0,4), (2,4), (1,5)\n- (1,3) has an apple and is accessible\n\nBoth are good options. Let me think about long-term strategy. I have 5 apples, enemy has 6. I need to catch up. Getting an apple now is important.\n\nBut also consider: If I go UP to (2,5), I'm moving away from the cluster of apples on the left side (1,3), (1,4), (0,0), etc. If I go LEFT to (1,4), I'm moving toward more apples and away from the enemy (who is on the right side).\n\nAlso, from (1,4), I have more maneuverability - I can go to (1,3), (0,4), (1,5), or back to (2,4). From (2,5), I'm more constrained - I can only go to (1,5), (3,5), or (2,4) (which is backwards into my body if I just moved there, so actually I can't go back immediately after moving forward unless I grow, but that's a future concern).\n\nWait, important rule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" So after moving, if the cell I just left becomes part of my body, I cannot move back into it.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the movement. When I move, my entire body shifts. So if I move from (2,4) to (2,5), my body becomes: head at (2,5), then (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4). So my old position (2,4) becomes part of my body. Then in the next turn, I cannot move back to (2,4).\n\nGiven this, from (2,5), my possible moves would be:\n- UP to (2,6) - has an apple!\n- DOWN to (2,4) - this is backwards into my own body, would kill me\n- LEFT to (1,5) - empty\n- RIGHT to (3,5) - empty (but need to check if it's safe)\n\nFrom (1,4), my possible moves would be:\n- UP to (1,5) - empty\n- DOWN to (1,3) - has an apple!\n- LEFT to (0,4) - empty (but is it on board? Yes, (0,4) is on the left edge)\n- RIGHT to (2,4) - backwards into my own body, would kill me\n\nBoth have good options. But let me think about the enemy's potential moves. The enemy is at (5,2) with 6 apples. They might be going for apples too. Are there any apples in their vicinity? Looking at the apple list: (9,3), (8,4), (9,4) are in the top-right corner, far from enemy. (4,0), (5,0) are near but not directly adjacent to enemy head at (5,2). Enemy might go DOWN to (5,1) but that's their body. Or LEFT to (4,2), or RIGHT to (6,2) which is their body, or UP to (5,3) which is their body.\n\nActually, looking at the board: Row 2 shows \"1\" at (5,2) and \"T\" at (6,2). So (6,2) is enemy body. (5,3) is also enemy body. So enemy cannot move UP or RIGHT directly. They can move DOWN to (5,1) or LEFT to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is empty on the board. (5,1) is enemy body (the board shows \"T\" at (5,1)). So the only safe move for enemy might be LEFT to (4,2).\n\nIf enemy moves to (4,2), that's getting closer to the apples at (4,0) and (5,0). So enemy might be targeting those.\n\nFor me, both UP and LEFT are safe. But I think LEFT is slightly better because:\n1. It puts me at (1,4), which is closer to the cluster of apples on the left side (1,3, 0,0, etc.)\n2. From (1,4), I have more escape routes - I can go DOWN to (1,3) to get another apple, or LEFT to (0,4), or UP to (1,5)\n3. It moves me away from the enemy's potential path (enemy is on the right side)\n\nActually, let me double-check the board for any immediate threats I might have missed. Looking at the visual:\n\nRow 4: . A 0 T T T T T A A\nThis means:\n(0,4): empty\n(1,4): apple\n(2,4): my head (0)\n(3,4): my body (T)\n(4,4): my body (T)\n(5,4): my body (T)\n(6,4): my body (T)\n(7,4): my body (T)\n(8,4): apple\n(9,4): apple\n\nSo (1,4) is indeed an apple and is empty (not my body, not enemy body). Safe.\n\nFor UP to (2,5): Looking at row 5, column 2. Row 5: . . A . . . . . A .\nSo (2,5) is an apple. Is it empty? Yes, the board shows \".\" there (actually it shows \"A\" at (2,5) according to the apple list, and row 5 shows \". . A\" which means (0,5): empty, (1,5): empty, (2,5): apple). So (2,5) has an apple and is empty.\n\nBoth are equally good in terms of getting an apple now. But let me think about future turns.\n\nIf I go to (1,4):\n- Next turn I can go DOWN to (1,3) which also has an apple!\n- That would be 2 apples in a row: (1,4) and (1,3)\n- From (1,3), I could go LEFT to (0,3), DOWN to (1,2), or RIGHT to (2,3), or UP to (1,4) (but that's backwards into my body)\n\nIf I go to (2,5):\n- Next turn I can go UP to (2,6) which also has an apple!\n- That would be 2 apples in a row: (2,5) and (2,6)\n- From (2,6), I could go LEFT to (1,6), RIGHT to (3,6), or DOWN to (2,5) (backwards)\n\nBoth routes give me a path to two consecutive apples. But the left route (1,4 -> 1,3) is more isolated from the enemy, while the up route (2,5 -> 2,6) is closer to the center.\n\nAlso, I need to consider my body length. I currently have 5 apples, which means my body is 5 segments long (not counting the head). Wait, no - if I have 5 apples collected, and I started with a length, the game usually starts with length 3 or 4. Let me check: my body list shows 5 segments: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). So including head, my length is 6. With 5 apples, that makes sense if I started at length 1 or 2.\n\nActually, standard snake starts at length 1 (just head). But here my body has 5 segments, so total length is 6. With 5 apples eaten, that suggests I started at length 1 (head only), and each apple adds 1 segment. So I started at (2,4) with length 1, ate 5 apples, now length 6.\n\nThis means I need to be careful about not trapping myself. The LEFT route moves me toward the edge, but the board is 10x10 so edges are not necessarily traps.\n\nLet me think about the edge. (1,4) is not at the edge yet. (0,4) is the left edge. I can go to (0,4) if needed.\n\nActually, I realize I should also consider if the enemy might move in a way that threatens me. Enemy is at (5,2). I'm at (2,4). The distance is 3 in x and 2 in y. Even if enemy moves optimally towards me, they can't reach me in one turn. So both moves are safe from enemy collision this turn.\n\nDecision time: I think LEFT is slightly better because:\n1. It positions me to get a second apple quickly at (1,3)\n2. It moves me away from the enemy's general location (right side of board)\n3. The left side of the board seems to have more apples (0,0, 1,3, 1,4, maybe others)\n4. More strategic options on the left edge\n\nSo I'll go LEFT.\n\nWait, but I need to be absolutely sure (1,4) is safe. Let me check the board again. Row 4: \". A 0 T T T T T A A\" means (1,4) is \"A\" (apple) and is not occupied by any snake. Yes, safe.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. The enemy has 6 apples, I have 5. I need to catch up. Getting an apple now is critical. Both LEFT and UP give me an apple. Which one is safer long-term?\n\nFrom (1,4): I can go to (1,3) for another apple. That's good.\nFrom (2,5): I can go to (2,6) for another apple. That's also good.\n\nBut looking at the full apple list: (2,6), (1,3), (1,4), (0,0), (4,0), (5,0), etc. The left cluster seems denser. Also, (2,6) is near the top-right area which might be closer to the enemy's potential path if they go after (8,4), (9,4), etc.\n\nI think LEFT is the right choice. It's safer and leads to more apples in a cluster.\n\nOne final check: Is there any way the enemy could move to (1,4) this turn? No, they're at (5,2). They'd need to move 4 steps left, which is impossible in one turn.\n\nIs there any way I could trap myself by going LEFT? From (1,4), I can go to (1,3), (0,4), (1,5). All are valid moves (not into my own body). The only forbidden move would be back to (2,4) which would be backwards. So I have 3 options, which is good.\n\nTherefore, I choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Analyzed the board state. The enemy snake (#1) is located at (4,1) with its body extending to the right. My head is at (0,4). The immediate apples are at (1,4) (to the right) and (0,5) (up). Moving left is illegal (off-board). Moving down to (0,3) is not an apple but is safe. Moving right to (1,4) is an apple. Moving up to (0,5) is not an apple.\n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (4,1). If the enemy moves Up, it will reach (4,2). If the enemy moves Right, it will reach (5,1). If the enemy moves Down, it goes off-board and dies. If the enemy moves Left, it reaches (3,1). None of these potential moves threaten my position at (0,4) or (1,4) immediately.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,4), I consume the apple and grow. My tail will stay at (6,4), extending my body length to 7 segments (head at 1,4). This move is safe from the enemy's current position and potential moves.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,5), I do not collect an apple, but I stay on the edge. However, moving RIGHT gives me an apple and places my head at (1,4). From (1,4), I can access (1,3) and (1,5) next turn. (1,3) contains an apple. This creates a path to collect multiple apples.\n\nComparing the immediate options:\n- RIGHT to (1,4): +1 Apple, safe. Opens up (1,3) for next turn.\n- UP to (0,5): +0 Apple, safe. Openings are (0,6) and (1,5).\n- DOWN to (0,3): +0 Apple, safe. Openings are (0,2) and (1,3).\n\nThe option to move RIGHT to (1,4) provides an immediate score increase and positions me well to collect the apple at (1,3) on the subsequent turn. This is the most efficient path to catching up to the enemy's score of 6 (currently I am at 6, but the prompt implies I need to increase my lead or at least maintain pace; actually, the prompt says \"I need to catch up to the enemy's score of 6\", but my apples are listed as 6. The prompt text says \"Snake #1 apples: 6\" and \"Your snake apples: 6\". Wait, the prompt says \"I need to catch up to the enemy's score of 6\". If I also have 6, I am tied. However, looking at the \"Scores so far\" in the prompt: \"Your snake (ID 0) apples: 6\" and \"Snake #1 apples: 6\". The rationale in the LAST MOVE info says \"I need to catch up to the enemy's score of 6\". This might be a slight inconsistency in the prompt history or a perspective shift, but the data clearly shows both at 6. Regardless, moving to an apple is strictly better than not moving to an apple, provided it is safe.\n\nThe move RIGHT is safe. The enemy is at (4,1). The distance is significant. There are no other snakes. My own body is at (1,4) through (6,4). Wait, my head is at (0,4). My body is [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)].\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,4), I am moving into the cell currently occupied by my own body (the segment immediately following my head). According to the rules: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" and \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n\nMy current head is at (0,4). My body starts at (1,4). Moving RIGHT goes to (1,4). This is moving directly backwards into my own body. This is illegal and fatal.\n\nI must avoid moving into my own body.\nMy body occupies: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4).\nMy head is at (0,4).\nPossible moves:\n- Right: (1,4). Occupied by my body. Illegal.\n- Left: (-1,4). Off board. Illegal.\n- Up: (0,5). Empty (checked the board grid: row 5, col 0 is '.'). Safe.\n- Down: (0,3). Empty (row 3, col 0 is '.'). Safe.\n\nSo I cannot move Right. I must choose between Up and Down.\n- Up to (0,5).\n- Down to (0,3).\n\nApples nearby:\n- (1,3) is an apple.\n- (1,4) is an apple (currently occupied by my body, but will move away next turn if I survive).\n- (0,0) is an apple (far away).\n- (2,5) is an apple (up/right).\n\nIf I move UP to (0,5):\n- I am at (0,5).\n- Next turn I can move to (1,5) or (0,6) or (0,4).\n- (1,4) will be empty next turn (tail moves from (6,4) to (5,4), so (1,4) becomes empty).\n- From (0,5), I can move RIGHT to (1,5) next turn. (1,5) is empty. Then I can move DOWN to (1,4) to eat the apple there. Then DOWN to (1,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0,3):\n- I am at (0,3).\n- (1,3) is an apple. I can move RIGHT to (1,3) next turn and eat it.\n- (0,2) is empty.\n\nLet's compare the paths.\nPath A (UP): (0,4) -> (0,5) -> (1,5) -> (1,4) [Eat] -> (1,3) [Eat]. This takes 3 turns to start eating, but eats 2 apples in 4 turns.\nPath B (DOWN): (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) [Eat]. This takes 1 turn to start eating.\n\nHowever, the apple at (1,4) is currently occupied by my body. The apple at (1,3) is free.\nIf I go DOWN to (0,3), I am setting up to eat (1,3) immediately next turn.\nIf I go UP to (0,5), I am setting up to eat (1,4) (which I must wait to be free) or (1,5) (no apple).\nActually, looking at the board:\nRow 5: \". . A . . . . . A .\" -> (2,5) is an apple.\nRow 4: \"0 T T T T T T . A A\" -> (8,4) and (9,4) are apples.\nRow 3: \". A . . . T T . . A\" -> (1,3) and (9,3) are apples.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,5):\n- I am at (0,5).\n- Next move could be RIGHT to (1,5). (1,5) is empty.\n- From (1,5), I can move DOWN to (1,4). (1,4) will be empty. This allows me to eat the apple at (1,4) on turn 20.\n- Then DOWN to (1,3) to eat the apple there on turn 21.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0,3):\n- I am at (0,3).\n- Next move RIGHT to (1,3) eats the apple immediately on turn 19.\n- From (1,3), I can move UP to (1,4) on turn 20. (1,4) will be empty. This eats the apple at (1,4).\n- Then I can move UP to (1,5) or RIGHT to (2,3).\n\nBoth paths allow me to eat both apples (1,4) and (1,3).\nPath Down: Eat (1,3) first.\nPath Up: Eat (1,4) first (wait one turn).\n\nHowever, there is a critical detail: My body is currently blocking (1,4). If I move DOWN to (0,3), my body shifts.\nCurrent Body: [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)]\nHead moves (0,4) -> (0,3).\nTail moves (6,4) -> (5,4).\nNew Body: [(0,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)].\nWait, the list is head-to-tail.\nHead: (0,3).\nSegment 1: (1,4) (previous head position? No, previous head was (0,4). The body list provided in the prompt is the list of body segments excluding head? No, prompt says \"Head: (0,4), Body: [(1,4)...]\". So the full snake is: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4)...\nIf I move DOWN to (0,3):\nNew Head: (0,3).\nNew Body starts at (0,4).\nSo the new body list is: [(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)].\nThe tail (6,4) is removed.\nSo (1,4) is still occupied by my body in the next turn! (It is the second segment).\nTo eat the apple at (1,4), I need (1,4) to be empty.\nCurrently (1,4) is occupied.\nIf I move DOWN to (0,3), (1,4) remains part of my body (segment index 1).\nIf I move UP to (0,5), my body becomes [(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)]. (1,4) is still occupied.\n\nIn both cases, (1,4) remains occupied for the next turn.\nTo eat (1,4), I need to wait until the tail passes over it, or I need to grow enough that I don't need to wait? No, the segment (1,4) is fixed in the body chain for a while.\nLet's trace the movement of the segment at (1,4).\nCurrent chain: ... (0,4) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) ...\nIf I move DOWN: (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) ...\nThe segment at index 1 (currently at (1,4)) moves to (1,4) -> (2,4)? No.\nSegment 0 (Head) moves from (0,4) to (0,3).\nSegment 1 moves from (1,4) to (0,4) (where head was).\nSegment 2 moves from (2,4) to (1,4).\nSo, after moving DOWN, the cell (1,4) will contain Segment 2 (which was previously at (2,4)).\nSo (1,4) is still occupied by my body.\n\nThis means I cannot eat the apple at (1,4) immediately. I have to wait for the tail to vacate the space or for the apple to be \"uncovered\" by the movement.\nThe apple at (1,4) is currently covered by my body. I cannot eat it until that part of my body moves away.\nSince I am moving, my body moves.\nIf I move DOWN:\n(1,4) is currently occupied by the 2nd segment.\nAfter moving, the 2nd segment moves to (2,4). The 1st segment moves to (1,4).\nSo (1,4) remains occupied by my body.\nThe apple at (1,4) is effectively \"inside\" my body. I cannot eat it until that segment of my body moves away from that coordinate.\nThis happens when the tail moves. The tail is at (6,4). The chain length is 7 (Head + 6 Body).\nThe coordinate (1,4) is at index 1 (counting from 0).\nIt will take 6 moves for the tail to reach that position and vacate it, assuming I don't grow.\nWait, that's incorrect. The body slides.\nIf I don't grow, the segment at (1,4) will move to (2,4), then (3,4), etc.\nSo I can never eat an apple that is currently buried inside my body by just moving forward. The apple must be in an empty cell in front of my head (or I must eat it by moving onto the cell it occupies, but I can't move onto my body).\nWait, if an apple is at (1,4) and my body is at (1,4), I cannot eat it because I can't occupy that space. The apple is blocked.\nThis means the apple at (1,4) is currently unreachable because it is inside my body.\nI should not plan to eat (1,4) until it is cleared.\nLet's check the board again.\nBoard row 4: \"0 T T T T T T . A A\"\nCoordinates:\n(0,4): 0 (Head)\n(1,4): T (Body)\n(2,4): T\n(3,4): T\n(4,4): T\n(5,4): T\n(6,4): T\n(7,4): .\n(8,4): A\n(9,4): A\n\nSo the apple at (1,4) is NOT on the board. The \"Apples at\" list includes (1,4)? No, the list is:\nApples at: (2, 6), (0, 0), (4, 0), (9, 3), (8, 4), (5, 0), (2, 9), (1, 3), (7, 7), (9, 4), (8, 9), (4, 8), (8, 5), (2, 5), (1, 2)\nWait, let me re-read the board state carefully.\nRow 4: `0 T T T T T T . A A`\nRow 3: `. A . . . T T . . A`\nRow 5: `. . A . . . . . A .`\n\nThe text `Apples at` list is provided separately.\nLet's look at the coordinates in the `Apples at` list:\n(2, 6) - Row 6, Col 2\n(0, 0) - Row 0, Col 0\n(4, 0) - Row 0, Col 4\n(9, 3) - Row 3, Col 9\n(8, 4) - Row 4, Col 8\n(5, 0) - Row 0, Col 5\n(2, 9) - Row 9, Col 2\n(1, 3) - Row 3, Col 1\n(7, 7) - Row 7, Col 7\n(9, 4) - Row 4, Col 9\n(8, 9) - Row 9, Col 8\n(4, 8) - Row 8, Col 4\n(8, 5) - Row 5, Col 8\n(2, 5) - Row 5, Col 2\n(1, 2) - Row 2, Col 1\n\nNote that (1, 4) is NOT in the `Apples at` list. The `Apples at` list is the authoritative source for apple locations.\nThe board visualization row 4 shows `. A A` at the end, which corresponds to (8,4) and (9,4) in the list.\nThe board visualization row 4 shows `0 T T T T T T . A A`.\nThis matches the list: (8,4) and (9,4) are apples.\nThe board visualization row 3 shows `. A ...` at the start. This corresponds to (1,3) in the list.\nThe board visualization row 5 shows `... A ...` at index 2. This corresponds to (2,5) in the list.\n\nCrucially, the `Apples at` list does NOT contain (1,4).\nMy body is at (1,4). There is NO apple there.\nThe `Apples at` list DOES contain (1,3).\nThe `Apples at` list DOES contain (2,5).\nThe `Apples at` list DOES contain (8,4) and (9,4).\nThe `Apples at` list DOES contain (0,0) and (4,0) and (5,0).\n\nSo my previous concern about eating an apple at (1,4) was unfounded because there is no apple there.\nThe apple I see on the board visualization at (1,4) is actually my body segment (T).\nThe apple visible on row 4 at the end is (8,4) and (9,4).\n\nLet's re-evaluate safe moves and apple targets.\nMy head: (0,4).\nMy body: (1,4)...(6,4).\nEnemy: (4,1)...\n\nSafe moves from (0,4):\n- Right: (1,4) -> Occupied by my body. Illegal.\n- Left: Off board. Illegal.\n- Up: (0,5). Empty. Safe.\n- Down: (0,3). Empty. Safe.\n\nApples reachable from (0,5) or (0,3):\nFrom (0,5):\n- (1,5) is empty.\n- (0,6) is empty.\n- (2,5) is an apple (at (2,5)). Accessible via (1,5) -> (2,5).\nFrom (0,3):\n- (1,3) is an apple. Accessible directly via (1,3).\n- (0,2) is empty.\n\nPlan 1: Move DOWN to (0,3).\nNext turn: Move RIGHT to (1,3) to eat apple (1,3).\nThen: From (1,3), I can move UP to (1,4) (safe), or RIGHT to (2,3).\nFrom (1,4), I can access (1,5) or (2,4) (occupied by body).\n(2,5) is an apple at (2,5). From (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (2,5).\nOr (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5).\n\nPlan 2: Move UP to (0,5).\nNext turn: Move RIGHT to (1,5).\nThen: Move RIGHT to (2,5) to eat apple (2,5).\nThen: Move DOWN to (2,4) (occupied by body? Wait, my body is at (1,4)...(6,4).\nIf I move UP to (0,5):\nBody moves to [(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)].\n(2,4) is occupied by my body.\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,5):\nBody moves to [(0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)].\n(2,4) is occupied.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,5):\nI need (2,5) to be empty.\nIt is an apple.\nIs it occupied?\nMy body is at (2,4). (2,5) is adjacent.\nSo (2,5) is empty.\nSo I can eat (2,5).\nFrom (2,5), I can move UP to (2,6) (apple there! (2,6) is in the list). Or LEFT to (1,5), or DOWN to (2,4) (occupied by body), or RIGHT to (3,5).\n\nComparing Plan 1 (Down) and Plan 2 (Up):\nPlan 1 (Down):\n(0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) [Eat Apple (1,3)] -> ...\nPlan 2 (Up):\n(0,4) -> (0,5) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) [Eat Apple (2,5)] -> (2,6) [Eat Apple (2,6)]\n\nPlan 2 allows eating two apples in quick succession: (2,5) then (2,6).\nPlan 1 allows eating (1,3).\nBoth plans are safe.\nPlan 2 seems better because it leads to a cluster of apples at (2,5), (2,6), (1,2), (1,3)? No, (1,2) is an apple too.\nWait, (1,2) is an apple.\nIf I go Down to (0,3) -> (1,3) [Eat], I am close to (1,2) and (1,4) (empty).\nActually, from (1,3), I can go DOWN to (1,2) to eat that apple too.\nPath Down:\n(0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) [Eat 1,3] -> (1,2) [Eat 1,2] -> ...\nPath Up:\n(0,4) -> (0,5) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) [Eat 2,5] -> (2,6) [Eat 2,6] -> ...\n\nBoth paths offer 2 apples.\nLet's check for risks.\nEnemy snake is at (4,1). It is far away.\nHowever, if I go UP, I move towards the center (row 5, col 1/2).\nIf I go DOWN, I stay on the edge.\nStaying on the edge is generally safer.\nAlso, checking the board for Row 0: \"A . . . A A . . . .\"\nApples at (0,0), (4,0), (5,0).\nIf I go DOWN to (0,3), I can continue DOWN to (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) to eat that apple.\n(0,0) is an apple.\n(0,1) and (0,2) are empty (checked board: row 2 col 0 is '.', row 1 col 0 is '.').\nThis seems like a very safe and efficient path.\nPath Down/Left:\n(0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) [Eat] -> ...\nWait, the apple at (1,3) is on the way to (0,0)? No, (1,3) is to the right.\nIf I prioritize (0,0):\n(0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0).\nI pass through (0,3) and (0,2). (1,3) is to the right. (1,2) is to the right.\nTo eat (1,3) or (1,2), I would have to deviate from the straight path to (0,0).\nIf I go (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0).\nThis path eats (1,3) and (1,2) before (0,0).\n(1,3) is an apple. (1,2) is an apple. (0,0) is an apple.\nThat's 3 apples.\nLet's verify the board state for these coordinates.\nRow 3: \". A . . . T T . . A\" -> (1,3) is 'A'. Correct.\nRow 2: \". A . . T T T . . .\" -> (1,2) is 'A'. Correct.\nRow 1: \". . . . 1 . T . . .\" -> (0,1) is '.'.\nRow 0: \"A . . . A A . . . .\" -> (0,0) is 'A'.\n\nSo the path (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) collects 3 apples.\n(0,0) is at the corner.\nIs it safe to go to (0,0)?\nYes, because I am alone on the left side. The enemy is at (4,1).\nThe enemy could potentially reach (0,0) if it moves left 4 times, but it has a body blocking it and it's unlikely to rush there.\nAlso, by the time I reach (0,0), the enemy might be dead or distracted.\n\nLet's compare the Up path again.\nUp path: (0,4) -> (0,5) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (2,6).\nApples: (2,5), (2,6).\nThat's 2 apples.\nThere is also (1,2) and (1,3) nearby the Down path.\nThe Down path seems to offer more apples (3 potential vs 2).\nThe Down path keeps me on the edge (safer).\nThe Up path puts me at (2,6), which is near the center but not too exposed. (2,5) is also an apple.\n\nHowever, the Down path has a slight issue.\nAt (0,4), moving DOWN to (0,3) is safe.\nAt (0,3), I can move RIGHT to (1,3) to eat the apple.\nOr I can move DOWN to (0,2).\nIf I move to (0,2), I am at (0,2). (1,2) is an apple.\nIf I move to (1,3), I am at (1,3). (1,2) is an apple.\nSo both (0,2) and (1,3) give access to (1,2).\nHowever, (0,2) is closer to (0,0).\nIf I go (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0).\nI miss (1,3) and (1,2).\nIf I go (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0).\nI get all 3 apples.\n\nIs there any danger in this path?\nLet's check (1,1). Is it safe?\nRow 1: \". . . . 1 . T . . .\"\n(1,1) is empty.\nEnemy is at (4,1). The line of sight is clear.\nThe enemy could move Left to (3,1). Then Left to (2,1). Then Left to (1,1).\nThat would take 3 turns.\nIf I am at (1,2) or (1,3), I am safe.\nIf I am at (0,0), I am safe.\nThe only risky spot is (1,1).\nBy the time I reach (1,1), I will have eaten (1,3) and (1,2).\nI will be longer.\nIf I am at (1,2), and the enemy moves to (1,1), I survive.\nIf I am at (1,1), and the enemy moves to (1,1), we die.\nSo I should avoid being at (1,1) if the enemy might move there.\n\nThe enemy's current head is (4,1). Body is (4,2)...(6,1).\nIf the enemy moves Left, it goes to (3,1).\nIf the enemy moves Up, (4,2). Down, (4,0).\nIf the enemy moves Left twice, it reaches (2,1).\nIf the enemy moves Left thrice, it reaches (1,1).\nI am currently at (0,4). Turn 18.\nI will move (0,4) -> (0,3) (Turn 18).\nNext turn (19), I move (0,3) -> (1,3) (Eat apple).\nNext turn (20), I move (1,3) -> (1,2) (Eat apple).\nNext turn (21), I move (1,2) -> (1,1).\nThe enemy has 3 turns (18, 19, 20) to reach (1,1).\nIf the enemy moves Left 3 times: (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1). It reaches (1,1) on turn 21.\nWe would collide at (1,1) on turn 21.\nThis is a high risk.\n\nLet's reconsider the Up path.\n(0,4) -> (0,5) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (2,6).\nThis path is safer from the enemy. The enemy is at (4,1). It would take many turns to reach (2,5).\nAlso, (2,5) and (2,6) are apples.\nAre there other apples near Up path?\n(1,2) and (1,3) are closer to the Down path.\n(2,5) and (2,6) are Up.\n(8,4) and (9,4) are far right.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nApples at: (2, 6), (0, 0), (4, 0), (9, 3), (8, 4), (5, 0), (2, 9), (1, 3), (7, 7), (9, 4), (8, 9), (4, 8), (8, 5), (2, 5), (1, 2)\nClusters:\n- Left Bottom: (0,0), (4,0), (5,0), (1,2), (1,3). (and (1,2) is close to (1,3)).\n- Center/Up: (2,5), (2,6). (and (2,9)).\n- Right: (8,4), (9,4), (8,5), (9,3), (7,7), (8,9), (4,8).\n\nThe Left Bottom cluster is attractive but risky if the enemy rushes left.\nThe Up cluster (2,5), (2,6) is safer.\nThe Right cluster is very far.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,1). It has 6 apples. I have 6 apples.\nThe enemy is likely to go for the apples on the right or center, or defend its position.\nIt is unlikely to rush all the way to (0,0) immediately.\nHowever, the collision risk at (1,1) is real if I take the long path to (0,0).\n\nLet's check the \"Down\" path again.\n(0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2).\nFrom (1,2), I can go to (0,2) or (0,1) or (1,1) or (2,2).\n(0,2) is safe.\n(0,1) is safe.\n(1,1) is risky.\nIf I go to (0,2) from (1,2):\n(1,2) -> (0,2).\nFrom (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0).\nThis avoids (1,1).\nBut (0,0) is at (0,0).\nPath: (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) [Eat] -> (1,2) [Eat] -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) [Eat].\nThis path avoids (1,1).\nIs (0,2) safe?\nYes.\nIs (0,1) safe?\nYes.\nThis path collects 3 apples: (1,3), (1,2), (0,0).\nThis seems very good.\n\nLet's verify if I can reach (0,2) from (1,2).\nYes, LEFT is (0,2).\nThe board shows row 2: \". A . . T T T . . .\"\n(0,2) is '.'.\nSo (0,2) is empty.\n\nSo the plan is:\nTurn 18: (0,4) -> (0,3).\nTurn 19: (0,3) -> (1,3) [Eat Apple (1,3)].\nTurn 20: (1,3) -> (1,2) [Eat Apple (1,2)].\nTurn 21: (1,2) -> (0,2).\nTurn 22: (0,2) -> (0,1).\nTurn 23: (0,1) -> (0,0) [Eat Apple (0,0)].\n\nThis collects 3 apples safely.\nDoes the enemy pose a threat to (0,0)?\nThe enemy is at (4,1).\nIf the enemy moves Left 4 times: (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).\nThis would reach (0,1) on turn 22.\nI would be at (0,1) on turn 22.\nCollision.\nHowever, the enemy would have to move Left every single turn.\nIs the enemy likely to do that?\nThe enemy has apples at (4,0), (5,0) right next to it.\n(4,0) is directly below (4,1).\nThe enemy can eat (4,0) immediately.\nIf the enemy eats (4,0), it grows.\nAlso, the enemy has apples at (2,5) etc.\nMoving all the way to (0,0) is a long detour for the enemy.\nIf the enemy goes for (0,0), it gives me time to eat other apples.\nBut if we collide, we both die.\nI should avoid collision.\n\nLet's consider the Up path again.\n(0,4) -> (0,5) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) [Eat] -> (2,6) [Eat].\nThis path is safer.\nThere is also (1,2) and (1,3) nearby.\nFrom (2,6), I can go DOWN to (2,5) (already eaten or will be eaten).\nFrom (2,5), I can go LEFT to (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2).\nThis allows me to eat the Left Bottom cluster eventually, but starting from the Up path avoids the immediate collision risk.\nAlso, the Up path puts me closer to the center, giving me more options to move to the right if needed.\nThe Down path traps me on the left edge.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the collision risk on the Down path.\nIf the enemy moves Left 3 times, it reaches (1,1) on turn 21.\nI reach (1,2) on turn 20.\nIf I am at (1,2) on turn 20, and the enemy is at (1,1) on turn 21, I am safe.\nIf I move to (1,1) on turn 21, I die.\nSo I just need to avoid moving to (1,1) on turn 21.\nMy plan was (1,2) -> (0,2) on turn 21.\nSo I am safe.\nThe only danger is if the enemy moves to (0,2) or (0,1) or (0,0) before I get there.\nBut the enemy is at (4,1).\nTo reach (0,2), the enemy needs 4 moves: (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)? No.\n(4,1) to (0,2) is distance 5.\nI am at (0,4). To (0,0) is distance 4.\nI am faster to the corner.\nThe enemy would have to commit to a very risky strategy to contest (0,0).\nGiven the enemy is at 6 apples, it's likely playing for efficiency.\n\nHowever, there is another factor. My body.\nIf I go (0,4) -> (0,3), my tail moves from (6,4) to (5,4).\nMy body occupies (0,4), (1,4)...(5,4).\nIf I go (0,3) -> (1,3), my tail moves to (5,4).\nMy body occupies (0,3), (0,4), (1,4)...\nWait, (1,3) is an apple. I eat it. I grow. The tail does NOT move.\nSo my body gets longer.\nThis is good for survival but bad for maneuverability in tight spaces.\nThe Left edge is tight.\n\nLet's look at the Up path again.\n(0,4) -> (0,5). Safe.\n(0,5) -> (1,5). Safe.\n(1,5) -> (2,5). Eat (2,5). Safe.\n(2,5) -> (2,6). Eat (2,6). Safe.\n(2,6) -> (2,7). Empty? Row 7: \". . . . . . . A . .\" (7,7) is apple. (2,7) is empty.\n(2,7) -> (2,8). Empty? Row 8: \". . . . A . . . . .\" (4,8) is apple. (2,8) is empty.\n(2,8) -> (2,9). Eat (2,9).\nThis is a clear path up the column 2.\nApples on this path: (2,5), (2,6), (2,9).\nThat's 3 apples.\nAnd it's extremely safe. No wall collisions. No self collisions (body is below). No enemy collisions (enemy is far right/bottom).\nThe only risk is if the enemy somehow gets to column 2 before me, but it's at (4,1).\n\nThe Down path offers 3 apples: (1,3), (1,2), (0,0).\nThe Up path offers 3 apples: (2,5), (2,6), (2,9).\nBoth offer 3 apples.\nThe Up path is safer because I am not sandwiched against the wall. I can move left or right from column 2.\nFrom column 2, I can access column 1 or 3.\nFrom (2,9), I can go to (1,9) or (3,9).\n(1,9) is empty. (3,9) is empty.\nThe Down path leaves me at (0,0). From there I can only go to (0,1) or (1,0).\n(1,0) is empty (Row 0: A . . . A A ...). (1,0) is '.'.\nSo I have an escape route from (0,0).\nHowever, the Up path seems more flexible.\n\nLet's compare the immediate next moves.\nMove 1 (Turn 18):\nDown: (0,4) -> (0,3).\nUp: (0,4) -> (0,5).\n\nIf I go Down:\nI am at (0,3). Next target (1,3).\nIf I go Up:\nI am at (0,5). Next target (1,5) -> (2,5).\n\nWhich is better?\nThe apples at (1,3) and (1,2) are close to the enemy's starting area (4,1). The enemy might rotate towards them.\nThe apples at (2,5), (2,6), (2,9) are further away and safer.\nAlso, (2,5) and (2,6) are vertically aligned, making for efficient consumption.\n(1,3) and (1,2) are also vertically aligned (if we consider (1,3) -> (1,2)).\nBut (0,0) is separate.\n\nIf I go Up, I avoid the potential collision with the enemy at (1,1) entirely.\nIf I go Down, I risk collision if the enemy rushes left (unlikely but possible).\nGiven the scores are tied (6-6), minimizing risk is important. Dying now would lose the game.\nThe Up path seems to have lower collision probability.\n\nLet's double check the board for (0,5).\nRow 5: \". . A . . . . . A .\"\n(0,5) is '.'.\n(1,5) is '.'.\n(2,5) is 'A'.\nThis is clear.\n\nLet's double check the board for (0,3).\nRow 3: \". A . . . T T . . A\"\n(0,3) is '.'.\n(1,3) is 'A'.\nThis is also clear.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer Down?\nThe only reason is that (0,0) is an apple and is \"free\" if the enemy doesn't contest it.\nBut (2,5) is also free.\nThe Up path allows me to eat (2,5) and (2,6) in turns 20 and 21.\nThe Down path allows me to eat (1,3) in turn 19 and (1,2) in turn 20.\nThe Down path is slightly faster to the first apple (Turn 19 vs Turn 20).\nHowever, the Up path puts me in a better long-term position.\n\nOne final check on the \"Backwards\" rule.\nIf I go Up to (0,5), my body is at (0,4), (1,4)...\nIf I later try to go Down to (0,4), that's moving into my body. That's correct.\nFrom (0,5), I can go Left (off board), Right (1,5), Up (0,6).\nFrom (0,3), I can go Left (off board), Right (1,3), Down (0,2).\nBoth have 3 options (excluding backwards).\n\nLet's look at the enemy again.\nEnemy at (4,1). Body to (6,1).\nIt is in a confined space on the bottom right.\nIt has apples at (4,0), (5,0).\nIt will likely eat those.\nIf I go Up, I move away from it.\nIf I go Down, I move towards the bottom left.\nThe bottom left has apples (0,0), (4,0), (5,0), (1,2), (1,3).\n(4,0) and (5,0) are contested by the enemy.\n(0,0) is far for the enemy.\n(1,2) and (1,3) are closer to the enemy than (0,0).\nIf I go for (1,2) and (1,3), I am moving closer to the enemy's potential path.\nIf I go for (2,5) and (2,6), I am moving away.\n\nDecision: Move UP.\n\nRationale summary:\nI am at (0,4). The only safe moves are UP and DOWN (LEFT is wall, RIGHT is into my body).\nMoving UP to (0,5) positions me to collect the apple at (2,5) and (2,6) safely on the left-center side of the board. This path avoids the enemy snake at (4,1) and avoids the tight corner against the wall. Moving DOWN to (0,3) would allow me to collect (1,3) and (1,2), but this brings me closer to the enemy and traps me against the wall. The UP path offers a safer long-term route to collect multiple apples (2,5, 2,6, 2,9) with less risk of collision.\n\nFinal check on coordinates: (0,5) is valid.\nBoard size 10x10 (0-9).\n(0,5) is within bounds.\n(0,5) is empty.\n(0,5) is not occupied by my body (my body is at (0,4), (1,4)...).\nSo (0,5) is safe.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nOne detail: The \"Last Move Rationale\" mentioned moving LEFT to (1,4). That was incorrect because (1,4) is occupied by my body. I am correcting that.\n\nThe plan is to move UP.\n\nFinal Answer:\nUPUP",

Moving here is illegal/collision.\n    *   **LEFT**: (-1, 5). Off-board. Illegal.\n    *   **RIGHT**: (1, 5). Currently free? Let's check the body list. The body is (0,4), (1,4), (2,4)... (1,5) is *not* in the body list. (1,5) is currently free.\n\n5.  **Comparison of Safe Moves**:\n    *   **UP to (0, 6)**:\n        *   **Safety**: Safe. No immediate walls or body parts.\n        *   **Future Options**: From (0, 6), I can go to (0, 7), (1, 6), or back to (0, 5). This opens up the path towards the apples at (1, 6) (empty), (2, 6) (apple), and eventually (2, 9) (apple).\n        *   **Enemy Threat**: Minimal. The enemy is at (4, 0). They are focused on the bottom right corner (apples at 4,0; 5,0; 8,4; etc.). Moving UP moves me away from them and towards a safer cluster of apples on the left/center edge.\n    *   **RIGHT to (1, 5)**:\n        *   **Safety**: Safe. (1, 5) is empty.\n        *   **Future Options**: From (1, 5), I can go to (1, 6) (apple), (2, 5) (apple), (1, 4) (occupied by my body), or (0, 5) (backwards).\n        *   **Enemy Threat**: Moving towards the center. While the enemy is currently distant, (1, 5) is closer to the center than (0, 6). The path (1, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6) is available but (2, 5) is an apple.\n        *   **Risk**: Moving RIGHT puts me closer to the horizontal line Y=4 where my body is currently located (1,4, 2,4...). My body occupies the line X=1..6, Y=4. If I move to (1, 5) and later move DOWN to (1, 4), I must ensure that (1, 4) is empty. Currently, (1, 4) is occupied. However, by the time I reach (1, 5), my tail will have advanced.\n    \n    *   **Why UP is strictly better for survival**:\n        *   My body currently forms a wall at Y=4. The apple at (2, 5) is directly above the body at (2, 4). To eat (2, 5), I would need to approach from (1, 5) or (2, 6) or (3, 5).\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (1, 5) and then UP to (1, 6) to get the apple at (2, 6), I am safe.\n        *   However, if I go RIGHT to (1, 5), I am adjacent to my own body at (1, 4). This limits my DOWN move to a dangerous one (into body).\n        *   If I go UP to (0, 6), I am not adjacent to my body (closest body part is (0, 4) or (1, 4)). This gives me more freedom to maneuver later.\n        *   Furthermore, the apple at (2, 9) is a high-value target that is hard to reach from the center (1,5) without getting trapped. From the left edge (0, 6), it is a clear path up the edge: (0, 6) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) -> (0, 9) -> (1, 9) -> (2, 9). This path is on the edge, minimizing collision risks from the enemy.\n\n6.  **Long-term Plan**:\n    *   Move **UP** to (0, 6).\n    *   Continue moving UP along the left edge (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9) to collect the apple at (2, 9) (via (1, 9)).\n    *   Loop back down through (2, 6) and (2, 5) on the center-left.\n    *   Avoid the bottom right quadrant where the enemy snake is active.\n\n7.  **Enemy Analysis**:\n    *   Snake #1 is at (4, 0) with body at (4, 1) and (6, 1). They are likely to move towards apples at (4, 0), (5, 0), or (8, 4).\n    *   They are not an immediate threat to (0, 5) or (0, 6).\n\n**Decision**: Move UP.\n\nUP",

The ASCII map confirms (0, 6) is my head (symbol '0'), and my body segments at (0, 5) and (0, 4) are distinct. I will trust the ASCII map as it represents the current visual state.\n\nFrom (0, 6), the available moves are:\n- UP to (0, 7): Free, safe, moves along the left edge.\n- DOWN to (0, 5): This is the first segment of my body. Moving here is a collision (suicide).\n- LEFT to (-1, 6): Off the board (x < 0).\n- RIGHT to (1, 6): Free (ASCII shows '.'), safe.\n\nI must choose between UP and RIGHT.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **RIGHT (1, 6)**: Moves into the center. While safe now, (1, 6) is adjacent to the apple at (2, 6). The center area is becoming crowded. My body currently occupies Y=4 from X=0 to 4 (and X=5, 6 by Snake #1). Moving RIGHT brings me closer to the vertical wall of my body at Y=4 and the enemy body at X=5, 6. It also risks trapping me if the enemy moves into the center. Furthermore, to get to the high-value apple at (2, 9) from (1, 6), I would have to navigate around the occupied Y=4 line or cross it dangerously.\n- **UP (0, 7)**: Moves along the left edge. This is a classic Snake strategy. The edge provides safety on one side. From (0, 7), I can continue UP to (0, 8) and (0, 9). From (0, 9), I can move RIGHT to (1, 9) and then to (2, 9) to collect that apple. This path is clear on the ASCII board (all '.' or 'A'). This route avoids the dense center and the immediate threat of the enemy snake in the bottom right.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\n1.  Move UP along the left edge to (0, 9).\n2.  Turn RIGHT to (2, 9) to eat the apple.\n3.  Descend through the center-left area (2, 8, 7, 6, 5) to eat apples at (2, 6) and (2, 5).\n4.  Avoid the bottom right quadrant where the enemy is active.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP is safer and offers a clearer path to high-value apples than RIGHT. RIGHT exposes me to the center congestion too early.\n\nUP",

Let me verify the body: T's at (0,6), (0,5), (0,4) - yes. Then (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) are also T's. So my body is correct.\n\n**Potential moves from (0, 7):**\n- **UP to (0, 8)**: Check board - ASCII shows '.' at (0, 8) (row 8, column 0). This is safe.\n- **DOWN to (0, 6)**: This is my body (first segment after head). **DEAD**\n- **LEFT to (-1, 7)**: Off board (x < 0). **DEAD**\n- **RIGHT to (1, 7)**: Check board - ASCII shows '.' at (1, 7) (row 7, column 1). This is safe.\n\nSo two options: UP or RIGHT.\n\n**Now consider enemy movement:** Snake #1 head at (5, 1). They have 8 apples vs my 6. They are closer to the center apples. They could potentially move toward (8, 9) apples or (8, 5) etc.\n\n**Strategy consideration:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 7):\n- I'm moving into the center\n- The apple at (2, 6) is reachable\n- But I'm entering a more dangerous zone where the enemy might be active\n- The enemy is currently at (5, 1) - far from me, but they could come up the center\n\nIf I go UP to (0, 8):\n- I'm going along the left edge (safer)\n- From (0, 8) I can go to (0, 9) next turn\n- From (0, 9) I can go RIGHT to (1, 9), (2, 9) - there's an apple at (2, 9)\n- This keeps me away from the enemy's current position\n- The left edge is clear and I can snake along it\n\n**Long-term planning:**\n- My current score is 6, enemy is 8 - I'm behind\n- I need to collect apples efficiently\n- The apple at (2, 9) is high value (top corner)\n- The apples at (2, 6) and (2, 5) are also available\n- Going UP sets me up to collect (2, 9) safely\n- Going RIGHT immediately might lead to more congestion\n\n**Enemy analysis:** Snake #1 is in bottom right (5, 1). They have many apples. They might go for (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9), or (9, 3), (9, 4) area. They're not threatening the left edge currently.\n\n**Decision:** UP is safer and positions me better for the apple at (2, 9) which is a high-value target.

This is safe.\n2. **DOWN to (0, 7)**: This is my body (first segment after head). **DEAD**\n3. **LEFT to (-1, 8)**: Off board (x < 0). **DEAD**\n4. **RIGHT to (1, 8)**: Check board - ASCII shows '.' at (1, 8) (row 8, column 1). This is safe.\n\nSo I have two safe options: UP or RIGHT.\n\n**Analysis of each option:**\n\n**Option 1: UP to (0, 9)**\n- Safe move (empty cell)\n- Positions me at top-left corner\n- From (0, 9), I can move RIGHT to (1, 9), (2, 9), etc.\n- There's an apple at (2, 9) that I can reach\n- Left edge is clear - I can snake up and down safely\n- Keeping me away from enemy's current position (they're at bottom-right)\n- Good defensive position\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (1, 8)**\n- Safe move (empty cell)\n- Moves me into center area\n- From (1, 8), I can reach apple at (2, 9) or (2, 6)\n- But I'm entering more congested area\n- Enemy snake is currently far away, but could potentially come up the center\n- More risk of future head-on collision\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n1. **Score Gap**: Enemy has 8 apples, I have 6. I need to catch up, but I must survive.\n2. **Apple Locations**: The apple at (2, 9) is highly valuable and reachable from either path, but UP gets me closer to it safely.\n3. **Enemy Behavior**: Enemy is at (6, 1) in bottom-right. They might go for apples in the right side: (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9), etc. They're less likely to threaten the left edge.\n4. **Safety**: Moving UP to (0, 9) keeps me on the edge with fewer variables. The left edge appears mostly clear of obstacles.\n5. **Future Options**: From (0, 9), I have two directions (RIGHT and DOWN). From (1, 8), I have three directions, but more potential conflicts.\n\n**Decision**: I'll go UP to (0, 9). This is the safer move that positions me perfectly to collect the apple at (2, 9) on subsequent turns while keeping me away from the enemy and minimizing collision risks. The left edge strategy is sound and gives me time to plan my attack on the center apples.\n\nUP",

Apples are present at (2, 9), (4, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 4), (8, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (0, 0), (9, 3), (8, 4), (4, 8), (8, 9).\n\nMy current head is (1, 9).\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP (1, 10)**: Invalid (out of bounds).\n2.  **DOWN (1, 8)**: Valid and empty. My body extends from (0, 9) to (0, 4). (1, 8) is not part of my body. The enemy is far away.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 9)**: Invalid (occupied by my own body, specifically the segment immediately behind the head).\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 9)**: Valid. This cell contains an apple. I will grow if I move here.\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Right (2, 9)**: Moving here collects an apple immediately. However, (2, 9) is a bottleneck. My tail is currently at (0, 4) and will move to (0, 5) after the turn. If I move Right to (2, 9), my body will occupy (1, 9), (0, 9)... The only adjacent cells to (2, 9) are (1, 9) (occupied by my new neck), (3, 9) (empty), and (2, 8) (empty). While (2, 8) is currently empty, the area around the top right (8, 9) and (9, 4) is congested with apples and the wall. Moving all the way to the right corner risks trapping myself against the wall or the enemy later. The apple at (2, 9) is accessible from the left side as well.\n*   **Down (1, 8)**: Moving here is safe. It keeps my snake relatively centered on the board. It maintains a connection to the left side apples ((0, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6)) and allows me to pivot towards the right side apples ((8, 9), (9, 4), etc.) or the top left later. By not moving to (2, 9) immediately, I avoid the tight corner and keep my escape routes open.\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nAvoid getting cornered in the top right. Move Down to (1, 8) to stay flexible. This allows me to harvest apples in the middle or top left later without getting trapped.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n*   Down (1, 8): Not out of bounds. Not in my body. Enemy is at (8, 1) - safe.\n\nI will move Down to maintain flexibility.\n\nDOWN",

Body blocks the bottom right corner.\n- **Board**: 10x10. Apples scattered.\n\n**Analysis of Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP (1, 9)**: Invalid. My body currently occupies (1, 9) (the segment that was my neck).\n2.  **DOWN (1, 7)**: Valid. (1, 7) is currently empty ('.' in the board state). It is safe from self-collision. It is far from the enemy snake at (9, 1).\n3.  **LEFT (0, 8)**: Invalid. My body occupies (0, 8).\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 8)**: Valid. (2, 8) is empty ('.' in the board state). It is safe from self-collision. It is far from the enemy.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- **Down to (1, 7)**: This move keeps me in the central-left column. It positions me to access the apples at (2, 6) and (0, 0) in the future. The area is relatively open. (1, 7) is adjacent to (2, 7) (empty), (1, 6) (empty), and (0, 7) (my body, but entering from (1, 7) to (0, 7) would be backwards in 2 turns if my tail doesn't move far enough, but immediate next turn it's fine).\n- **Right to (2, 8)**: This moves towards the right side. However, the top-right corner is quite crowded with apples at (8, 9), (9, 4), etc., and the walls. The path (2, 8) -> (2, 9) -> (3, 9) leads to a tight corridor near the wall. While (2, 9) is an apple, moving there immediately risks getting trapped against the wall in subsequent turns, especially if the enemy snake (ID 1) heads towards the right side apples (though it is currently far away).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **Down to (1, 7)** is the safer choice. It maintains flexibility and keeps me away from the congested right edge. It keeps options open to move down towards (0, 0) or right towards (2, 6) / (2, 5) in the next turn. The enemy is at the bottom right (9, 1) and not an immediate threat.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSurvive and grow. Avoid getting boxed in by the walls on the right side. Harvest the cluster of apples on the left side (0,0) and center (2,5/2,6) first.\n\nDOWN",

DOWN would create a tight, risky path that could force a self-collision on the next move.\n\nStrategy: Take UP to (9,2) this turn.

Body extends along the bottom from (5, 0) to (9, 1).\n    *   The enemy is far away on the right side. They are not an immediate threat to my position at (1, 7).\n    *   They might be heading towards (9, 3) or (8, 4) or (9, 4) apples, which are far from me.\n*   **Apples:**\n    *   (0, 0) is at the bottom left. Distance from (1, 7) is 1 + 7 = 8 steps (Manhattan). This is a target for later.\n    *   (1, 3) is nearby. Distance is 4 steps.\n    *   (2, 6) is nearby. Distance is 1 step right + 1 step down (from head at 1,7 to 2,7 to 2,6) = 2 steps.\n    *   (2, 5) is a bit further.\n    *   (8, 7) is far right.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (1, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 8):**\n    *   **Status:** **DEATH**.\n    *   **Reason:** My own body is at (1, 8). Moving into your own body kills you. This is the \"neck\" which was the head on turn 25.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 7):**\n    *   **Status:** **DEATH**.\n    *   **Reason:** My own body is at (0, 7) (the segment connecting to the tail). It is currently occupied. If I move there, I hit myself.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):**\n    *   **Status:** **VALID**.\n    *   **Coordinates:** (2, 7).\n    *   **Check:** Empty on the board ('.'). No snake bodies there.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me towards the center. From (2, 7), I can access (2, 6) [apple], (2, 8), (3, 7), or potentially loop back to (1, 7) in the future once my tail moves. It opens up the central area.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (1, 6):**\n    *   **Status:** **VALID**.\n    *   **Coordinates:** (1, 6).\n    *   **Check:** Empty on the board ('.'). No snake bodies there.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me closer to the bottom-left apples (0, 0) and (1, 3). This aligns with the long-term goal of securing the left side of the board where the enemy is not present. (1, 6) is safe from immediate self-collision.\n\n**Comparing RIGHT (2, 7) vs DOWN (1, 6):**\n\n*   **Safety:** Both are currently empty.\n*   **Future Options:**\n    *   From **(2, 7)**: I am in the column x=2. I can go Down to (2, 6) [Apple], Left to (1, 7) (safe in 2 turns as tail moves), Right to (3, 7), or Up to (2, 8).\n    *   From **(1, 6)**: I am in the column x=1. I can go Down to (1, 5), Left to (0, 6), Right to (2, 6) [Apple], or Up to (1, 7).\n*   **Apple Proximity:**\n    *   (2, 7) is 1 step from (2, 6) (apple) and 2 steps from (2, 5) (apple).\n    *   (1, 6) is 1 step from (2, 6) (apple) and 5 steps from (0, 0) (apple).\n*   **Enemy Interaction:** The enemy is at (9, 2). If the enemy moves North, they might threaten the middle row y=2 or y=3. Being at (1, 6) keeps me in the safe left zone, away from potential conflict in the center-right. Being at (2, 7) puts me closer to the center column which might become contested.\n\n**Decision:**\n**Down to (1, 6)** is the chosen move.\n1.  It avoids the immediate death traps of Up and Left.\n2.  It moves deeper into the \"safe\" left side of the board, away from the enemy's current trajectory on the right.\n3.  It keeps the apple at (2, 6) accessible (via Right move next turn).\n4.  It aligns with the long-term plan to eventually grab (0, 0) and control the left wall.\n5.  (1, 6) is currently empty, and (1, 5) below is also empty, providing an escape route if needed.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nDescend to the bottom left to secure the (0,0) and (1,3) apples. Use the left wall as a safe boundary. Only engage the center/apples near the enemy if the path is clear and the enemy is distracted. Maintain length to survive until turn 150 or until opponent error.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Based on the \"Board state\" visual, there is an 'A' (Apple) at (8, 4). The enemy is likely to move UP towards (9, 4) or LEFT towards (8, 3). The enemy is far away and not an immediate threat.\n*   **Immediate Threat Assessment (Turn 28):**\n    *   **UP to (1, 7):** My own body is there. **DEATH**.\n    *   **DOWN to (1, 5):** Empty ('.' on visual). **SAFE**.\n    *   **RIGHT to (2, 6):** Empty ('.' on visual). **SAFE**.\n    *   **LEFT to (0, 6):** Empty ('.' on visual). **SAFE**.\n    *   **Confusion Check:** The provided text list for Apples includes `(2, 6)`. However, the ASCII board visualization clearly shows `(2, 6)` as a '.' (empty). I must prioritize the visual board state as it is the current snapshot. The apple at (2, 6) is effectively gone or visually confirmed empty.\n*   **Strategy - Targeting the Left Wall:**\n    My long-term strategy is to control the left wall (x=0) where the enemy is not present.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** or **RIGHT** (to 2,6) shifts my position to x=1 or x=2, moving me away from the left wall and deeper into the board center.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to (0, 6) places my head directly on the left wall (x=0).\n*   **Future Safety & Options from (0, 6):**\n    *   From (0, 6), I can move **UP** to (0, 7) or **DOWN** to (0, 5).\n    *   (0, 7) is currently occupied by my body (segment 6). However, by the time I reach (0, 6) and wish to move again, my tail will have advanced (unless I eat an apple). If I don't eat an apple this turn, my tail moves from (0, 7). This creates a path UP along the left wall.\n    *   (0, 5) is currently empty.\n    *   This secures the border, reducing collision vectors to just 2 directions (Left is wall, Right is board).\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   (1, 5) (Down) moves me towards the bottom but keeps me at x=1. It is a \"Safe\" move but \"Positionally Weaker\" than securing the wall.\n    *   (2, 6) (Right) moves me to x=2. This moves me away from the safe left wall and towards the center where enemies might roam.\n    *   (0, 6) (Left) secures the left wall, aligns with the long-term plan of dominating the left side, and provides a safe corridor for future turns.\n\n**Decision:**\n**Left** to (0, 6). This is the most strategically sound move. It transitions my snake to the border, establishing a safe perimeter and setting up a descent along the left wall to harvest the bottom-left apples ((0,0), (1,3)). It avoids the immediate trap of moving Up into my body and avoids wandering into the center or lower middle without securing the boundary first.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

The board state provided is likely the state *before* the move calculation, reflecting the apples available.\n\n**Move Evaluation (Current Head: (0, 4)):**\n\n*   **UP to (0, 5):**\n    *   Check (0, 5) on board: Empty ('.').\n    *   Check body collision: My body is at (0, 5) (the previous head position). Moving UP puts me back into my own body. **DEATH.**\n\n*   **LEFT to (-1, 4):**\n    *   Off the board. **DEATH.**\n\n*   **DOWN to (0, 3):**\n    *   Check (0, 3) on board: Empty ('.').\n    *   Check body collision: My body is at (0, 5), (0, 6)... None at (0, 3).\n    *   Check enemy collision: Enemy body is nowhere near (0, 3).\n    *   Check enemy head prediction: Enemy is at (8, 5). Possible moves: (8,6), (8,4), (7,5), (9,5). They cannot reach (0, 3).\n    *   **Result:** SAFE.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 4):**\n    *   Check (1, 4) on board: Empty ('.').\n    *   Check body collision: My body is at (0, 5), (0, 6)... None at (1, 4).\n    *   Check enemy collision: No.\n    *   Check enemy head prediction: Cannot reach (1, 4).\n    *   **Result:** SAFE.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to (0, 3) and RIGHT to (1, 4).\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am currently at (0, 4). The apple at (1, 3) is close. Moving RIGHT to (1, 4) puts me directly adjacent to (1, 3) (which is an apple) and (2, 3). However, (1, 3) is adjacent to my body at (1, 6) and (0, 5/6). More importantly, I need to consider the path to the apple at (0, 0). Moving DOWN to (0, 3) keeps me on the safe wall path towards (0, 0).\n\nHowever, looking at the board state:\n`3 . A . . . . . . . T`\n`2 . A . . . . . . A T`\n\nThe apple at (1, 3) is immediately to my right. If I move RIGHT to (1, 4), I am eating distance from (1, 3). If I move DOWN to (0, 3), I am moving away from (1, 3) and towards (0, 2) and (0, 1) (which are empty).\n\nWait, looking closer at the board state for row 3: `3 . A . . . . . . . T`\n(1, 3) is an apple.\nRow 2: `2 . A . . . . . . A T`\n(1, 2) is an apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 4), I am in a position to eat (1, 3) on the next turn.\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 3), I am safe but not progressing towards the immediate apple.\n\nLet's check safety of (1, 4) vs (0, 3).\n(1, 4) is empty.\n(0, 3) is empty.\n\nThe enemy is at (8, 5). They are not a threat to me this turn.\n\nIs there a risk in moving RIGHT?\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 4), my body will be [(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), ...].\nOn the next turn, I can move DOWN to (1, 3) to eat the apple.\nIs (1, 3) safe for the next turn?\nMy body will be at (1, 4) and (0, 4).\n(1, 3) is DOWN from (1, 4).\nSo moving DOWN into (1, 3) would be moving into the cell directly behind my head? No, if I am at (1, 4), the segment behind me is (0, 4). (1, 3) is a new direction.\nSo (1, 3) is safe to move into from (1, 4), provided no other snake is there.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(1, 3) is an apple.\n(1, 2) is an apple.\n(2, 5) is an apple (currently at x=2, y=5).\n(2, 6) is an apple.\n\nMy current body blocks x=0, y=5 and above, and x=1, y=6 and above.\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) opens up the bottom-right quadrant for me.\n\nLet's reconsider the DOWN move to (0, 3).\nFrom (0, 3), I can go DOWN to (0, 2) (empty), then (0, 1) (empty), then (0, 0) (apple).\nThis is a very safe, guaranteed path to an apple.\nFrom (1, 4), I can go DOWN to (1, 3) (apple), then LEFT to (0, 3) (empty) or DOWN to (1, 2) (apple).\nThe path through (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) is also very safe and yields 2 apples quickly (turns 31 and 32).\n\nWhich is better?\nPath A (Down): (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0). 4 moves, 1 apple.\nPath B (Right): (0,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2). 3 moves, 2 apples.\n\nPath B is clearly superior in terms of efficiency and score.\nHowever, I must ensure (1, 4) is safe.\nIs there any reason (1, 4) is dangerous?\nMy body is at (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6)...\n(1, 4) is clear.\nThe enemy is far away.\n\nWait, looking at the board state again:\nRow 4: `4 0 . . . . . . . T T`\nWait, the input says:\n`4 0 . . . . . . . T T`\n`5 T . A . . . . . 1 .`\nAh, I see `0` at (0,4). That's my head.\nAnd `1` at (8,5). That's the enemy head.\nThe `T`s represent body parts.\nMy body is listed as: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9)].\nSo (0,5) is T. (0,6) is T. (1,6) is T. (1,7) is T. (1,8) is T. (1,9) is T.\nThis matches the board visualization:\nRow 6: `T T A . . . . . . .` -> (0,6) T, (1,6) T.\nRow 5: `T . A . . . . . 1 .` -> (0,5) T.\nRow 4: `0 . . . . . . . . T T` -> (0,4) 0. (8,4) T, (9,4) T.\nWait, the enemy body is at (8,4), (9,4)...\nRow 4 shows `T T` at the end. That matches enemy body at (8,4) and (9,4).\nMy body at (1,9) is at Row 9, Column 1.\nRow 9: `9 . T A A . . . . A .` -> (1,9) is T. Correct.\n\nSo (1, 4) is definitely empty.\n\nThe decision is between (0, 3) (Safe, 1 apple eventually) and (1, 4) (Safe, 2 apples quickly).\nTaking (1, 4) puts me in a more aggressive position but yields better points.\nI am currently down 6 apples to 12. I need to close the gap.\nThe \"Safe\" path (Down) is too slow.\nI must take the \"Efficient\" path (Right).\n\nLet's verify the collision logic for (1, 4) one last time.\nHead: (0, 4) -> (1, 4).\nBody: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6)...\n(1, 4) is not in the body.\n(1, 4) is on the board.\nEnemy at (8, 5) cannot reach (1, 4).\nConclusion: (1, 4) is safe and optimal.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (1, 4) to prepare for eating the apple at (1, 3). From there, I will move DOWN to (1, 3), then DOWN to (1, 2) to eat the second apple. This sequence yields 2 apples in 3 turns. After eating at (1, 2), I will be positioned near the bottom-left corner to decide whether to loop back to (0, 0) or explore the center, depending on the enemy's position. Closing the score gap is the priority.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Their length is 14. They are continuing to grow.\n\n*   **Apples:**\n    *   (1, 2) is directly DOWN from my current head. This is a guaranteed apple on this turn if safe.\n    *   (0, 0) is at the bottom left corner.\n    *   (2, 3) is directly to my RIGHT. I am currently sitting on (1, 3), which was an apple.\n    *   (2, 5) and (2, 6) are nearby to the right.\n\n**Move Evaluation (Current Head: (1, 3)):**\n\n*   **UP to (1, 4):**\n    *   Check (1, 4): Currently occupied by my own body (the previous head position).\n    *   **Result:** DEATH. Moving backwards is fatal.\n\n*   **LEFT to (0, 3):**\n    *   Check (0, 3): Empty ('.'), according to the board state (Row 3: `. 0 A . . . . . . T`).\n    *   Check body collision: No body parts at (0, 3).\n    *   Check enemy collision: Enemy at (8, 7) is far away.\n    *   **Result:** Safe, but moves away from the immediate apple at (1, 2).\n\n*   **DOWN to (1, 2):**\n    *   Check (1, 2): Apple ('A').\n    *   Check body collision: No body parts at (1, 2).\n    *   Check enemy collision: Enemy at (8, 7) is far away.\n    *   **Result:** SAFE and GROWING. This allows me to eat the apple at (1, 2). However, I must consider that my body will extend to cover (1, 3) after this move.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 3):**\n    *   Check (2, 3): Apple ('A').\n    *   Check body collision: No body parts at (2, 3).\n    *   Check enemy collision: Enemy at (8, 7) is far away.\n    *   **Result:** SAFE and GROWING. This allows me to eat the apple at (2, 3).\n\n**Decision:**\nI have two safe apple options: DOWN to (1, 2) or RIGHT to (2, 3).\n*   **Path to (1, 2):** Eating here puts me at (1, 2). My body will extend back to (1, 3) and (1, 4). From (1, 2), I can see apples at (0, 0) and (2, 2) and (3, 2).\n*   **Path to (2, 3):** Eating here puts me at (2, 3). My body will extend back to (1, 3) and (1, 4). From (2, 3), I have a clear line to apples at (2, 0) (via (2, 2), (2, 1)), (3, 2), and (4, 8) is far away but reachable.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 3: `. 0 A . . . . . . T`\nRow 2: `. A . A . . . . A T`\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 2):\nNext turn, I will be at (1, 2). My body will be at (1, 3), (1, 4), etc.\nFrom (1, 2), I can go DOWN to (1, 1) (empty), LEFT to (0, 2) (empty), or RIGHT to (2, 2) (empty).\nApples visible from (1, 2) are (0, 0), (2, 0), (3, 2). (0, 0) is blocked by my body at (0, 4)... wait, (0, 4) is my body. (0, 3) is empty. (0, 2) is empty. (0, 1) is empty. (0, 0) is apple.\nSo (0, 0) is accessible via (0, 1) -> (0, 0).\nHowever, if I go RIGHT to (2, 3):\nI am at (2, 3). Body is (1, 3), (1, 4)...\nFrom (2, 3), I can go DOWN to (2, 2) (empty), LEFT to (1, 3) (occupied by my new body segment), or UP to (2, 4) (empty), or RIGHT to (3, 3) (empty).\nApples visible from (2, 3): (2, 0), (3, 2).\n(2, 0) is accessible via (2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 0).\n(3, 2) is accessible via (2, 2) -> (3, 2) or (3, 3) -> (3, 2).\n\nBoth moves lead to viable paths.\nHowever, looking at the enemy snake's potential moves: It is at (8, 7) and likely targeting the apples at (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 7), or (4, 8). It is far from me.\nI am safe in either direction.\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other?\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 2), I am moving towards the left wall and the bottom corner. The board has a T (enemy body) at (0, 5) and (0, 6). My body is at (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6). Wait, let's check my body list.\nMy body: [(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)].\nSo (0, 5) and (0, 6) are occupied by me.\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 2):\nNext move, I can go DOWN (1, 1) -> (1, 0). (1, 0) is 'A' in the board state (Row 0: `A . A . T T . . . A`).\nWait, Row 0: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`\n`A . A . T T . . . A`\n(1, 0) is '.'? No, (0, 0) is A, (1, 0) is '.', (2, 0) is A.\nSo (1, 0) is a valid space.\n(0, 0) is an apple. I can reach (0, 0) via (0, 2) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0).\nHowever, if I go RIGHT to (2, 3):\nI am at (2, 3). From here, (2, 0) is a nice cluster of apples.\n(2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2) are all nearby.\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 2: `. A . A . . . . A T`\n(2, 2) is '.'.\nRow 1: `. . . . . T T T T T`\n(2, 1) is '.'.\nRow 0: `A . A . T T . . . A`\n(2, 0) is 'A'.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (2, 3) opens up a dense cluster of apples in the bottom right quadrant (relative to my current position) while avoiding the \"tighter\" feel of the left wall where my body is already somewhat stacked (at (0,4)-(0,6)).\nAlso, if I go RIGHT, I am moving away from my own body at (1, 4) and the wall.\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 2), I am moving closer to the bottom wall and (1, 0), but (0, 0) is reachable.\nHowever, the apples at (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2) seem denser and safer from being cornered.\nThe left side has my body occupying a column (0, 4)-(0, 6). While (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1) are open, it's a narrower corridor.\nThe right side offers (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0) and (3, 2). This looks like a better farming area.\n\nLet's verify safety of (2, 3):\nIs (2, 3) empty? Yes.\nIs it my body? No.\nIs it enemy body? No (Enemy is at x=8-9).\nIs it enemy head? No (Enemy is at (8, 7)).\nSo (2, 3) is safe.\n\nLet's verify safety of (1, 2):\nIs (1, 2) empty? Yes (Board state says `A` there).\nIs it my body? No.\nIs it enemy body? No.\nIs it enemy head? No.\nSo (1, 2) is safe.\n\nBetween the two, RIGHT feels slightly more versatile for future farming and less constrained by my existing body structure.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (2, 3). This moves me into the central-right area of the board, positioning me to farm the cluster of apples at (2, 0), (3, 2), and (2, 5). I will avoid the left wall where my body is currently anchored, giving me more room to maneuver. I must keep an eye on the enemy snake in the upper right, but for now, I am safe to grow.\n\nRIGHT",

This path is towards the bottom-left relative to my position, but away from the enemy.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* This is occupied by my *own* body (specifically, the segment that was my head last turn). Moving directly back into your own body results in death. **ILLEGAL.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* The board state shows (3, 3) is empty ('.'). No collision. Safe.\n    *   *Positioning:* Moves towards the center-right of the board. From (3, 3), I can access apples at (3, 2) (Down) or (4, 8) (Up/Right). However, moving RIGHT brings me closer to the enemy snake (currently at x=6).\n\n**Decision:**\nI need to choose between UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n*   **RIGHT** is the least desirable option because it directly closes the distance to the enemy snake (Head at (6, 7)), increasing the risk of a future head-on collision or getting trapped. I am currently winning in length (10 vs 14 for the enemy, wait, the enemy has 14 apples, so their length is likely 15. The scores say Enemy Apples: 14. My Apples: 8. My length is 10. Enemy length is 15. I am smaller. I must avoid direct confrontation.\n*   **UP (2, 4)** and **DOWN (2, 2)** both offer safe moves and access to apples.\n    *   **UP** moves towards the apple cluster at (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9). This is a vertical run.\n    *   **DOWN** moves towards the apple cluster at (3, 2), (2, 0). This is a safer horizontal/lower quadrant run.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (6, 7) and seems to be moving left (from (7, 7) to (6, 7)), they are potentially moving into the central area. Moving UP to (2, 4) positions me directly below the vertical line of apples (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9). This seems like a solid path to accumulate points quickly while staying on the left side of the board relative to the enemy.\n\nLet's check the board again.\nRow 4: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\n(2, 4) is empty. (1, 4) is my body. (3, 4) is empty.\nRow 5: `T . A . . . A . T .`\n(2, 5) is an apple. This is the immediate target if I go UP.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 2):\nRow 2: `. A . A . . . . A T`\n(2, 2) is empty. (3, 2) is an apple. (2, 0) is an apple.\nThis is also a very good path.\n\nComparing UP vs DOWN:\n*   **UP**: Target (2, 5) (Apple). From (2, 5), I can continue to (2, 6) (Apple) or (3, 5). This creates a vertical farming route.\n*   **DOWN**: Target (3, 2) or (2, 0). This requires navigating around my own body at (1, 3) and (0, 4) etc. From (2, 2), (2, 1) is empty (Row 1: `. . . . . T T T T T`, x=2 is empty). (2, 0) is an apple.\n\nBoth are viable. However, moving UP to (2, 5) allows me to eat an apple immediately (2, 5) and leaves me with a clear path to (2, 6) next. Moving DOWN to (2, 2) allows me to eat (3, 2) or (2, 0) eventually.\nThe board state shows (2, 5) is an apple. (2, 4) is empty.\nIf I go UP, I eat (2, 5)? No, I move to (2, 4). The apple is at (2, 5).\nWait, the apple is at (2, 5). To eat it, I must move to (2, 5). That is 2 squares away.\nI need to make a move *now*.\nCurrent: (2, 3).\nMove UP: (2, 4). Apple is at (2, 5).\nMove DOWN: (2, 2). Apple is at (2, 0) or (3, 2).\nMove RIGHT: (3, 3). Apple is at (3, 2).\nMove LEFT: (1, 3) (Death).\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\nApples at: (2, 6), (0, 0), (2, 9), (8, 9), (4, 8), (2, 5), (1, 2), (3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 0), (8, 2), (9, 0), (3, 2), (6, 5), (8, 8).\n\nFrom (2, 3):\n*   **UP to (2, 4):** Targets (2, 5) (distance 1), (2, 6) (distance 2). Good vertical flow.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 2):** Targets (3, 2) (distance 1), (2, 0) (distance 2). Good bottom-right flow.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 3):** Targets (3, 2) (distance 1). Good, but moves toward enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 7) and moving. I am at (2, 3). I am on the left side of the board. The enemy is on the right. Moving UP or DOWN keeps me in the left/center column (x=2). Moving RIGHT moves me to x=3.\nSince the enemy is moving left (from 7 to 6), I should likely stay left (x=2) or go down.\nHowever, (2, 4) is empty. (1, 4) is my body. (3, 4) is empty.\n(2, 2) is empty. (1, 2) is empty (apple was eaten previous turn? No, apple at (1, 2) was listed in apples. Wait, my last move was RIGHT to (2, 3). I didn't eat (1, 2). I ate (2, 3).\nThe apples list includes (1, 2).\nSo (1, 2) is still available.\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 2), I am at (2, 2). (1, 2) is an apple to my left.\nIf I go UP to (2, 4), I am at (2, 4). (2, 5) is an apple above.\n\nThe board has a \"T\" (enemy body) at (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6)...\nWait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\nRow 6: `T T A . . . . . . T .`\n(0, 6) is T. (1, 6) is T.\nBut my body is listed as: [(1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)].\nSo (0, 6) and (1, 6) are *my* body.\nThe board state visualization shows \"T\" for \"Tail/Body\" generally, usually mine or enemy.\nLet's look at the Enemy body: [(7, 7), (8, 7)...]\nThe board shows (8, 7) as T. (7, 7) as 1 (Head).\nSo the T's on the board are mixed.\nHowever, the Enemy body list provided explicitly is the ground truth.\nMy body list provided explicitly is the ground truth.\n\nLet's re-verify safety of (2, 4) and (2, 2).\n**Enemy Head:** (6, 7).\n**My Head:** (2, 3).\n\nIf I move **UP to (2, 4)**:\nIs (2, 4) in my body? No. My body x's are 0 and 1.\nIs (2, 4) in enemy body? No. Enemy x's are 4-9, but y=7 is head, y=6 is (8,6). (2, 4) is far away.\nIs (2, 4) on board? Yes.\nIs it safe from enemy head movement?\nEnemy at (6, 7) can move to (6, 6), (6, 8), (5, 7), (7, 7).\nDistance from (6, 7) to (2, 4) is large. No collision risk.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (2, 2)**:\nIs (2, 2) in my body? No.\nIs (2, 2) in enemy body? No.\nIs it safe? Yes.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (3, 3)**:\nIs (3, 3) safe? Yes.\nHowever, (3, 3) is closer to (6, 7).\n(3, 2) is an apple.\n(4, 8) is an apple.\n(6, 5) is an apple.\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 7). The apple at (6, 5) is 2 units away from the enemy.\nIf the enemy goes for (6, 5), they might move DOWN to (6, 6) then (6, 5).\nIf I am at (3, 3), I am moving towards the center.\nIf I am at (2, 4), I am staying left.\nIf I am at (2, 2), I am staying left but going down.\n\nThere is an apple at (4, 8). The enemy is at (6, 7). The enemy is closer to (4, 8) than I am.\nThere are apples at (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9). The enemy is far from these.\nI have a clear vertical path on x=2.\n(2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) (Apple) -> (2, 6) (Apple).\nThis is a very safe and efficient farming route.\nThe enemy is likely to engage with apples in the center/right ((6, 5), (8, 8), (8, 9), (4, 8)).\nBy moving UP to (2, 4), I secure the vertical corridor on the left side.\n\nThe board state shows (2, 4) is empty.\nRow 4: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(2, 4) is 'T'? No, (1, 4) is T. (2, 4) is '.'.\nWait, the board state row 4 is: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\n(0, 4) is '.'?\nLet's look at my body: (0, 4) is in my body list.\n`(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)...`\nThe board state row 4: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\n(0, 4) is '.' (Empty)? My body says (0, 4) is occupied.\nThere is a discrepancy between the visual board and the explicit body list.\n**Rule:** \"Use only the game state provided.\"\nThe explicit body list is part of the game state.\nThe visual board is a representation.\nI must trust the explicit coordinates.\nMy body includes (0, 4).\nSo (0, 4) is occupied by me.\nThe visual board might be slightly outdated or simplified (e.g. 'T' might represent a block, but not specific body parts).\nBut wait, the board row 4: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\n(0, 4) is '.'.\n(1, 4) is 'T'.\n(2, 4) is 'T'.\nMy body list says: (1, 4) is in body. (0, 4) is in body.\nIf (2, 4) is 'T' in the visual board, does that mean it is occupied?\nLet's look at the Enemy body: (7, 7), (8, 7)...\nRow 7: `. T . . . . . 1 T .`\n(8, 7) is T. (7, 7) is 1.\nLet's look at my body again: [(1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)]\n(2, 4) is NOT in my body list.\n(2, 4) is NOT in enemy body list.\nSo (2, 4) should be empty.\nWhy is the visual board showing 'T' at (2, 4)?\nRow 4: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(0, 4) = '.' (Empty visually)\n(1, 4) = 'T' (Occupied by me visually)\n(2, 4) = 'T' (Occupied by whom?)\nEnemy body has (4, 0), (5, 0)...\n(2, 4) is not in enemy body.\nIs it possible the visual board is showing obstacles or walls? No, the prompt says \"Board state\".\nMaybe the visual board 'T' at (2, 4) is an error in the visualization or I am misreading the row.\nRow 4: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\nMaybe the 'T's are just visual clutter for my own body?\nMy body: (1, 4) and (0, 4).\n(2, 4) is 'T'.\nIf (2, 4) is occupied, I cannot move there.\nLet's check the Enemy body again.\nHead (7, 7). Body: (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0).\nNone of these are (2, 4).\n\nLet's assume the visual board is accurate regarding occupancy, but maybe 'T' refers to *any* body part (mine or enemy).\nIf (2, 4) is 'T', it is occupied.\nIf (2, 4) is occupied, I cannot move UP.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 4: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\nRow 5: `T . A . . . A . T .`\nRow 3: `. T 0 . . . . . . T`\n\nIf (2, 4) is occupied (T), then UP is blocked.\nWhat about (2, 2)?\nRow 2: `. A . A . . . . A T`\n(2, 2) is '.' (Empty).\n(0, 2) is '.'.\n(1, 2) is 'A'.\n(3, 2) is 'A'.\n\nSo, if (2, 4) is blocked by 'T', I cannot go UP.\nI must check the 'T' at (2, 4).\nIs it possible that the 'T' at (2, 4) is actually my body?\nMy body list: (1, 4), (0, 4).\n(2, 4) is not listed.\nIs it possible the visual board is rotated or I am misreading the coordinates?\nCoordinates: (0,0) bottom left. (9,9) top right.\nRow 9 is top. Row 0 is bottom.\nRow 4 is y=4.\nVisual: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\nx=0, x=1, x=2...\n(0, 4) is '.' (Empty).\n(1, 4) is 'T' (My body).\n(2, 4) is 'T' (Unknown body).\n\nIf (2, 4) is occupied, I cannot move UP.\nI must look at alternatives.\n**DOWN to (2, 2):** (2, 2) is '.' (Empty). Safe.\n**RIGHT to (3, 3):** (3, 3) is '.' (Empty). Safe.\n**LEFT to (1, 3):** My body. Death.\n\nSo, if UP is blocked, I have DOWN and RIGHT.\nDOWN moves to (2, 2). From there, I can go to (2, 1), (2, 0) (Apple), or (3, 2) (Apple).\nRIGHT moves to (3, 3). From there, I can go to (3, 2) (Apple), (4, 3), (3, 4).\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 7).\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 2), I am moving away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 3), I am moving slightly towards the enemy but also towards apples.\n\nHowever, looking closely at Row 4:\n`. T T . . . . . . T T`\nIs it possible that (2, 4) is actually an apple? No, the apple list doesn't include (2, 4).\nApples: (2, 6), (0, 0), (2, 9), (8, 9), (4, 8), (2, 5), (1, 2), (3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 0), (8, 2), (9, 0), (3, 2), (6, 5), (8, 8).\n(2, 4) is not an apple.\n\nWhy would (2, 4) be 'T'?\nMaybe the visual board 'T' represents the *head* of the snake?\nHead of snake 0 is (2, 3). Row 3: `. T 0 . . . . . . T`\n(2, 3) is '0'.\n(1, 3) is 'T'.\nSo 'T' is body.\n(2, 4) is 'T'. This means (2, 4) is a body segment.\nBut my body list says (2, 4) is NOT in my body.\nIs it in enemy body?\nEnemy body: (7, 7), (8, 7)... (4, 0).\nNo (2, 4).\n\nThis is a conflict between the explicit coordinate list and the visual board.\n**Rule:** \"Use only the game state provided.\"\nThe explicit lists are part of the game state.\nThe visual board is a representation.\nHowever, if the visual board shows a 'T' at (2, 4), it implies a body is there.\nIf I ignore the visual board and rely only on the list, (2, 4) is empty.\nIf I rely on the visual board, (2, 4) is occupied.\n\nLet's check the visual board for other coordinates.\nMy head is (2, 3). Visual: `. T 0 . .`\n(2, 3) is '0'. Correct.\n(1, 3) is 'T'. Correct (part of my body).\n(2, 4) is 'T'. In my body list: (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5)... (2, 4) is NOT there.\nIn enemy body list: (8, 4) is there. (8, 4) is 'T' in Row 4 (at index 8).\nRow 4: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(0, 4) = '.'\n(1, 4) = 'T' (My body)\n(2, 4) = 'T' (Unknown)\n(8, 4) = 'T' (Enemy body)\n\nWait, looking at my body list again: (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5)...\nIs it possible I am misreading my own body coordinates?\n\"Your snake (ID: 0): ... Body: [(1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)]\"\nWait, (1, 3) is listed as Body?\n\"Head: (2, 3)\"\n\"Body: [(1, 3), ...]\"\nSo (1, 3) is the neck.\n(1, 4) is next.\n(0, 4) is next.\n\nSo (2, 4) is definitely NOT in my body list.\nAnd it's not in enemy body list.\nWhy is it 'T' on the board?\nMaybe the board is showing \"danger\" or \"potential\"?\nNo, \"Board state\".\nMaybe it's a visual glitch in the prompt, or I should treat 'T' as empty if it's not in the lists?\nIf I treat (2, 4) as empty (based on lists), UP is a great move.\nIf I treat (2, 4) as occupied (based on visual), UP is blocked.\n\nLet's look at the alternative: (2, 2).\n(2, 2) is '.' on the board.\nIs (2, 2) in my body? No.\nIs (2, 2) in enemy body? No.\nSo (2, 2) is definitely safe.\n\nIf (2, 4) is safe (based on lists), UP is best (farming vertical apples).\nIf (2, 4) is unsafe (based on visual), DOWN is best.\n\nLet's consider the \"T\" at (2, 4) again.\nCould it be an artifact of the board generation?\nIf I assume the prompt's explicit lists are the ground truth (as they are usually the source of truth in these games, while visuals are just summaries), then (2, 4) is empty.\nHowever, usually in Snake games, the visual board is the ground truth for collisions.\nLet's check if (2, 4) could be a body part I missed.\nMy body: (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8).\nThis seems to form a loop or a stack on the left.\n(1, 3) is adjacent to (2, 3) (Head).\n(1, 4) is above (1, 3).\n(0, 4) is left of (1, 4).\n(0, 5) is up.\n(0, 6) is up.\n(1, 6) is right.\n(1, 7) is up.\n(1, 8) is up.\n\nIf I go UP to (2, 4), I am moving to a cell that the visual board says is occupied.\nIf the visual board is wrong, I die if I don't move there (missing an apple route).\nIf the visual board is right, I die if I move there.\n\nLet's look at the visual board again.\nRow 4: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\nMaybe the 'T' at (2, 4) represents the tail of the enemy?\nEnemy tail is (4, 0).\nNo.\nMaybe the visual board is showing (x, y) transposed? No, row 4 is y=4.\nMaybe the board is showing obstacles?\n\"Normal X,Y coordinates are used.\"\nMaybe the 'T' at (2, 4) is actually an apple?\nApples list: (2, 5), (2, 6)...\nNo (2, 4).\n\nLet's look at the board state again carefully.\nRow 4: `. T T . . . . . . T T`\nRow 3: `. T 0 . . . . . . T`\nRow 5: `T . A . . . A . T .`\n\nIs it possible that (2, 4) is the \"head\" of a snake?\nHead of Snake 0 is (2, 3).\nHead of Snake 1 is (7, 7).\nSo no.\n\nLet's assume the visual board is accurate for occupancy.\nIf (2, 4) is 'T', it is occupied.\nTherefore, UP is blocked.\nI must choose between DOWN (2, 2) and RIGHT (3, 3).\n\nDOWN (2, 2):\n- Leads to (2, 1), (2, 0) (Apple), (3, 2) (Apple).\n- Moves away from enemy (currently at x=6).\n- Safe visual board cell.\n\nRIGHT (3, 3):\n- Leads to (3, 2) (Apple), (4, 3).\n- Moves closer to enemy (x=6).\n- Safe visual board cell.\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 7).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 3), the distance is 3 units.\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 2), the distance is 4 units (roughly).\nBoth are relatively safe from immediate collision.\n\nHowever, the apples on the right side (x=3, y=2) are valuable.\n(3, 2) is an apple.\n(2, 0) is an apple.\n(2, 5) is an apple (blocked by UP).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 2):\nI am at (2, 2).\nI can go DOWN to (2, 1) -> (2, 0) (Apple).\nI can go RIGHT to (3, 2) (Apple).\nI can go LEFT to (1, 2) (Apple).\nThis is a very dense cluster of apples at the bottom.\nRow 2: `. A . A . . . . A T`\n(0, 2) empty, (1, 2) Apple, (2, 2) I am there, (3, 2) Apple.\nRow 1: `. . . . . T T T T T`\n(2, 1) empty.\nRow 0: `A . A . T T . . .

Row 4: `. T T . . . . . . T T` -> (3, 4) is '.').\nThis is also viable, but slightly further from (2, 0) and (1, 2).\n\nThe enemy is moving left.\nIf the enemy moves left to (5, 7), then (4, 7), (3, 7)...\nThey might be targeting the center apples or trying to cut me off.\nBut for now, they are far.\n\nThe visual board conflict is the main issue.\nIf I ignore the visual 'T' at (2, 4) and move UP, and (2, 4) is actually empty, I miss the chance to go into the dense apple cluster at the bottom.\nIf I ignore the visual 'T' and (2, 4) is occupied, I die.\nIf I trust the visual 'T' and don't go UP, I go DOWN or RIGHT.\nDOWN puts me in a very dense apple area.\nRIGHT puts me in a less dense area (only (3, 2) nearby).\n\nLet's assume the visual board is correct.\nSo UP is blocked.\nDOWN to (2, 2) seems the best move to capitalize on the apple density.\nFrom (2, 2), I have 3 apple options (Left, Right, Down).\n\nWhat about the \"T\" at (2, 4)?\nMaybe it's a tail that will move?\nIf it's a body part, it moves next turn.\nIf I wait, I can go UP later.\nBut the apples at the bottom are *right now*.\n(2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 2).\nThe apples at the top are (2, 5), (2, 6).\n(2, 5) is adjacent to (2, 4).\nIf (2, 4) is blocked by a body that moves, (2, 5) might still be reachable later.\nBut the bottom apples are accessible *now*.\n\nLet's reconsider the 'T' at (2, 4).\nCould it be an error in my reading of the board?\nBoard:\nRow 9: `. . A A . . . . A .`\nRow 8: `. T . A A . . . A .`\nRow 7: `. T . . . . . 1 T .`\nRow 6: `T T A . . . . . . T .`\nRow 5: `T . A . . . A . T .`\nRow 4: `T T . . . . . . . T T`\nRow 3: `. T 0 . . . . . .

T T`\nIf (0, 4) is 'T', but my body says (0, 4) is in my body, that's consistent.\nIf (1, 4) is 'T', my body says (1, 4) is in my body. Consistent.\nIf (2, 4) is 'T', my body does NOT list (2, 4). Enemy body does NOT list (2, 4).\nThis is the inconsistency.\n\nMaybe the board is showing \"potential\" collisions or shadows?\nNo, \"Board state\".\nMaybe I should treat 'T' as 'T' (occupied) and '.' as '.' (empty).\nSo (2, 4) is occupied.\nTherefore, UP is fatal.\nI must move DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nComparing DOWN (2, 2) vs RIGHT (3, 3):\nDOWN puts me at x=2.\nRIGHT puts me at x=3.\nThe enemy is at x=6.\nThe difference in distance is negligible for immediate safety.\nHowever, the apples at x=2, y=0-2 are very dense.\n(2, 0) A\n(2, 1) .

It positions me in the center of a dense apple cluster and keeps me further from the enemy.\n\nWait, check Row 2 again: `. A . A . . . . A T`\n(0, 2) is '.'.\n(1, 2) is 'A'.\n(2, 2) is '.' (Target).\n(3, 2) is 'A'.\n(8, 2) is 'A'.\n\nCheck Row 1: `. . . . . T T T T T`\n(2, 1) is '.'.\n\nCheck Row 0: `A . A . T T . . . A`\n(2, 0) is 'A'.\n\nSo (2, 2) is a safe empty space surrounded by apples.\n\nFinal check on safety of (2, 2):\n- Board cell is '.'.\n- Not in my body.\n- Not in enemy body.\n- Enemy head (7, 7) cannot reach (2, 2) in one move.\n- If enemy moves to (6, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (3, 7) -> (2, 7), that takes multiple turns. I will have eaten apples and moved by then.\n\nDecision: Move DOWN.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (2, 2) to enter the dense apple cluster in the bottom center. From there, prioritize eating (2, 0), (1, 2), or (3, 2) based on the enemy's movement. Avoid the blocked column at (2, 4).\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

          "rationale": "Based on the provided game state and the reasoning from the previous turn (which was actually turn 33, not 34 as the prompt header suggests, but the logic holds), here is the analysis for the current move.\n\n**Analysis of Current State (Turn 34 Start):**\n\n*   **My Position (Snake 0):**\n    *   Head: **(2, 2)** (Previously at (2, 3)). I moved DOWN successfully.\n    *   Body: **[(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)]**\n    *   *Status:* Safe. I am now positioned in the dense apple cluster at the bottom center of the board. My length is 9 (since I haven't eaten an apple on this move yet, but I am at 8 apples score).\n    *   **Correction:** The prompt says \"My snake (ID: 0): ... Apples collected: 8\". The board state shows an apple at (3, 2) adjacent to (2, 2). I have not eaten it yet.\n\n*   **Enemy Position (Snake 1):**\n    *   Head: **(7, 8)** (Previously at (7, 8)? Wait, let's check the prompt data.\n        Prompt says: \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #1 - Head: (7, 8), Body: ... Apples: 14\".\n        Previous turn's enemy head was (7, 8) according to the \"Last Rationale\" which mentioned \"Head: (7, 8)\".\n        Wait, the \"Last Rationale\" in the prompt says: \"Enemy Position (Snake 1): Head: (6, 7) (Previously at (7, 7)).\"\n        There is a discrepancy between the prompt's current state description and the provided \"Last Rationale\" text.\n        \n        Let's look at the **Board State** provided in the prompt:\n        Row 8: `. . . A A . . 1 A .`\n        At x=7, y=8, there is a '1'. This confirms the Enemy Head is at **(7, 8)**.\n        \n        The \"Last Rationale\" text provided in the prompt seems to be from a different turn or contains errors (it mentions \"Turn 33\" and enemy at (6, 7)). I must rely on the **current board state** and the **current turn number (34)** provided in the header.\n        \n        **Current Enemy Head:** (7, 8)\n        **Current Enemy Body:** [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0)]\n\n**Move Evaluation (Current Head: (2, 2)):**\n\nI am at (2, 2). Surrounding cells:\n*   **UP to (2, 3):** This is currently my body (segment 0). **DEATH.**\n*   **DOWN to (2, 1):** The board state shows Row 1: `. . . . . T T T T T`. At x=2, y=1, it is empty ('.'). My body is mostly at x=0, 1, and 2,3. (2, 1) is not in my body list. **SAFE.**\n*   **LEFT to (1, 2):** The board state shows Row 2: `. A . A . . . . A T`. At x=1, y=2, it is 'A' (Apple). (1, 2) is not in my body list. **SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 2):** The board state shows Row 2: `. A . A . . . . A T`. At x=3, y=2, it is 'A' (Apple). (3, 2) is not in my body list. **SAFE.**\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am at (2, 2). I have apples available at (1, 2) and (3, 2).\nEnemy is at (7, 8).\nDistance to enemy is large. No immediate collision risk.\nI want to eat apples to grow and win.\n\nLet's compare **LEFT (1, 2)** and **RIGHT (3, 2)**.\n*   **LEFT (1, 2):** Eating this apple.\n    *   Future positions: From (1, 2), I can go DOWN to (1, 1) or UP to (1, 3).\n    *   (1, 1) is empty (Row 1).\n    *   (1, 3) is my body (Head was at (2, 3) last turn, so (1, 3) is body). So UP is blocked later.\n    *   This path leads towards the left edge where I have my tail.\n    *   (0, 0) is an apple, but (0, 1) and (0, 2) are empty. Access is okay.\n\n*   **RIGHT (3, 2):** Eating this apple.\n    *   Future positions: From (3, 2), I can go DOWN to (3, 1), UP to (3, 3), or RIGHT to (4, 2).\n    *   (3, 1) is empty (Row 1).\n    *   (3, 3) is empty (Row 3: `. T T . . . . . . T`).\n    *   (4, 2) is empty (Row 2).\n    *   This path leads towards the center/right, opening up more space.\n    *   It avoids the tight corner near my tail on the left.\n    *   It keeps options open for (4, 8) or (6, 5) in the future.\n    *   It avoids moving directly into the \"T\" territory at x=1, y=3.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT to (3, 2)** is the better choice. It eats an apple and positions me in a more open area (center) rather than near the edge/tail. While LEFT also eats an apple, it limits my upward mobility immediately (since (1, 3) is blocked by my tail) and forces me to navigate tighter spaces. RIGHT offers more freedom of movement for turn 35.\n\nDOWN to (2, 1) is safe but does not eat an apple. Eating is the priority unless it leads to certain death. Since both LEFT and RIGHT are safe and eat apples, I should choose the one with the better future path. RIGHT is better.\n\n**Plan for next turn (Turn 35):**\nEat apple at (3, 2). From there, evaluate (4, 2), (3, 3), or (3, 1). Likely move towards the center or continue down to the (2, 0) apple later.\n\nRIGHT",

This path leads towards the cluster at (4, 0) and (6, 0) but requires navigating around my tail or moving along the bottom edge. It is safe but low reward.\n*   **UP (3, 3):** Leads to the upper half. The apple at (4, 8) is visible. However, (3, 3) is a dead end relative to the left side (I cannot go UP to (3, 4) because (2, 4) and (1, 4) are my body, effectively blocking that vertical column unless I loop around the right). Moving UP forces me to go RIGHT eventually to avoid getting stuck.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 2):** Leads to the open center. This is the most flexible option. From (4, 2), I can continue right to access the apples at (8, 2) or (6, 5), or go UP to (4, 3) to access the upper apples (4, 8) or (3, 8). It keeps my path open and avoids the tight column on the left.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT to (4, 2)** is the best choice. It maximizes my future mobility and keeps me on a trajectory toward the dense apple pockets in the center and upper-right sectors of the board. It avoids boxing myself in against the left wall or my own tail.\n\n**Plan for next turn (Turn 36):**\nSecure (4, 2). From there, evaluate the route to (6, 5) or the upper cluster. Maintain distance from Snake #1 in the top-right corner.\n\nRIGHT",

This is a \"hallway\" of sorts between my body at (5, 2) and (5, 0) and (6, 0)? Actually, looking at Row 1: `. . . . . T T T T T`. The enemy body occupies x=5 to x=9 at y=1. My potential move to (4, 1) would be adjacent to (5, 1) which is the enemy body. This is risky if the enemy head moves to (4, 1) (unlikely but possible) or if I get trapped. However, (4, 1) is an open space.\n*   **UP (4, 3):** Leads to the upper area. (4, 3) is currently empty. This opens up access to the apples at (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9), etc. This is a good route to the dense apple pockets in the top half of the board.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 2):** Leads towards the apples at (6, 5) and (8, 2). The enemy is currently at (8, 9) but their body stretches down to (5, 0) and (8, 1). Moving right puts me closer to the enemy's body and head.\n\n**Comparison of Routes:**\nGoing **UP** seems more advantageous than RIGHT because:\n1.  The upper cluster (around y=8,9) has many apples ((3,8), (4,8), (2,9), (3,9)).\n2.  The enemy snake is currently in that upper cluster but moving UP gives me better positioning to either take apples or flank the enemy.\n3.  Going RIGHT (5, 2) brings me closer to the enemy's tail and body at (8, 1)/(5, 0) and (5, 1), which could lead to entrapment.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **UP to (4, 3)** is the best choice. It moves me toward the dense apple cluster in the top-left/center area (relative to the enemy's current position). This keeps my options open to sweep apples from the top down or to navigate around the enemy.\n\n**Plan for next turn (Turn 37):**\nSecure (4, 3). From there, I will likely aim for the apples at (4, 8) or (3, 8). I must be wary of the enemy snake (Snake #1) who is currently at (8, 9) and may move to intercept or eat the same apples. I will maintain distance and look for opportunities to cut off the enemy's path.\n\nUP",

(4, 4) is clear.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Value:** Moves me closer to the apples at (4, 8) and the dense cluster. Opens up path to (5, 4) or (4, 5).\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** Row 3 is `. T T . . . . . . T`. At (5, 3), it is `.` (empty).\n    *   **Snakes:** My body is at (4, 2) (left-down), (3, 2)... (5, 3) is clear.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Value:** Good. Moves towards (6, 5) apple. However, looking at Row 2: `.` at (5, 2) is empty, but (5, 4) is also `.`. This is a valid path.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** Row 3 is `. T T . . . . . . T`. At (3, 3), it is `T` (my body).\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH**. I would hit my own body segment at (3, 2) which connects to (4, 2).\n\n4.  **DOWN to (4, 2):**\n    *   **Board:** Row 2 is `. A T T 0 . . . . A T`. At (4, 2), it is `0` (my current head position).\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH**. I just moved from here. Moving back is moving into my own body (the segment that was at (4, 2) is now part of my body history).\n\n**Strategic Comparison: UP vs RIGHT**\n\n*   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy is at (7, 9). If they continue Left, they will hit (6, 9) (Apple). If they go Down, they will hit (7, 8) (empty but connects to their body). They are a threat to the top apples ((2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8)).\n*   **UP Route (4, 4):** Heads directly into the \"vertical corridor\" at x=4. This aligns me perfectly with the apples at (4, 8). I need to navigate past the obstacle at (4, 5) which is empty, but (4, 6) is `T` (my tail? No, my tail is at (0, 6)). Wait, looking at Row 6: `T . A . . . . . T .`. My body is at (0, 6). The `T` at (4, 6) is **Snake #1's body**.\n    *   *Correction:* The board shows `T` at (4, 6). This is part of the enemy body (Snake #1). The enemy body snakes down from (8, 6), (8, 5), etc.\n    *   So the path UP from (4, 4) is: (4, 5) is empty, but (4, 6) is blocked by enemy body.\n    *   However, I can navigate *around* the enemy body.\n*   **RIGHT Route (5, 3):** Leads to (6, 5) apple. (5, 3) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (6, 5).\n    *   Check (5, 5): Row 5 is `T . A . . . A . T`. (5, 5) is `.` (empty).\n    *   Check (6, 5): (6, 5) is `A` (Apple).\n    *   Check (4, 6) (Enemy Body): (4, 6) is `T`. (4, 6) is part of the enemy body. (4, 6) is adjacent to (5, 6).\n    *   The enemy body occupies (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4)...\n\n**Decision:**\nGoing **UP to (4, 4)** is the immediate best move.\nWhy? Because it positions me to go RIGHT to (5, 4) next turn. (5, 4) is empty. From (5, 4), I can access (6, 5) (Apple) or even (6, 4).\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 3) immediately, I am essentially committing to the bottom path. (5, 3) is a bit lower.\nHowever, looking at the board, (4, 4) is empty. (5, 4) is empty. (6, 4) is empty.\nThe cluster of apples at (6, 5) and (8, 2) is to the right.\nThe cluster at (4, 8) is blocked by enemy body at (4, 6) and (5, 6)? No, (5, 6) is `.`? Row 6: `T . A . . . . . T .`. (5, 6) is `.`.\nWait, (4, 6) is `T`. (5, 6) is `.`.\nSo the path UP is blocked at (4, 6).\nBut from (4, 4), I can go (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 5).\nThis path is clear.\n(4, 4) is better than (5, 3) because (5, 3) puts me at y=3, which is lower, and I might get boxed in by my own tail if I don't climb.\n\nLet's verify safety of (4, 4) again.\nRow 4: `T T . . . . . . T T`.\n(4, 4) is `.`. (3, 4) is `T` (My body? No, my body is at (3, 2), (2, 2)... (0, 6). (3, 4) is empty in my list).\nWait, check my body list: `(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)`.\n(3, 4) is NOT in my body.\nSo (3, 4) is empty on the board (`.`) and not in my body.\n(4, 4) is empty on the board and not in my body.\n(5, 4) is empty on the board.\n(6, 4) is empty on the board.\n(6, 5) is Apple.\n(7, 5) is `.`? Row 5: `T . A . . . A . T`. (7, 5) is `.`.\n(8, 5) is `T` (Enemy body).\n\nSo the path to the right is open.\nGoing UP to (4, 4) is safe and opens up the rightward path (5, 4) -> (6, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 3) immediately, I am at (5, 3).\nFrom (5, 3), I can go to (5, 4) or (6, 3) or (5, 2).\n(5, 2) is empty.\n(6, 3) is empty.\n(5, 4) is empty.\nActually, (5, 3) is also a strong move.\nWhy prefer (4, 4)?\n(4, 4) is slightly more central.\nAlso, consider the enemy. Enemy is at (7, 9). If they move DOWN to (7, 8), they are still far.\nIf they move LEFT to (6, 9), they eat an apple.\nIf they move DOWN, they might head towards (7, 5) or lower.\nIf I am at (4, 4), I have the option to go UP to (4, 5) -> (4, 6) is blocked, so I would need to detour.\nIf I am at (5, 3), I can go to (6, 4).\nActually, the apple at (6, 5) is prime.\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 5: `T . A . . . A . T`\nApples at (2, 5) and (6, 5).\nMy current position (4, 3) is close to (6, 5).\n(4, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 5). (3 moves).\n(4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 5). (3 moves).\n\nHowever, (4, 4) allows for a path to (4, 8) if I can find a way around the enemy body at (4, 6).\n(4, 6) is `T`.\n(5, 6) is `.`.\n(6, 6) is `.`? Row 6: `T . A . . . . . T .`. (6, 6) is `.`.\nSo I can go (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> (4, 6) is blocked -> (4, 7) is `.`? Row 7: `. . . . . . . T T .`. (4, 7) is `.`.\nWait, (4, 6) is blocked. I can't go (5, 6) -> (4, 6).\nBut I can go (5, 6) -> (5, 7) -> (4, 7).\n(5, 7) is `.`? Row 7: `. . . . . . . T T .`. (5, 7) is `.`.\n(4, 7) is `.`.\n(4, 8) is `A`.\nSo there IS a path to the top apples, just not a straight line.\nThe path (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (4, 8) exists.\nThis path avoids my body and the enemy body (mostly).\n\nIf I go (5, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 5).\n(7, 3) is `.`? Row 3: `. T T . . . . . . T`. (7, 3) is `.`.\n(7, 4) is `.`? Row 4: `T T . . . . . . T T`. (7, 4) is `.`.\nThis path is also clear.\n\nComparing (4, 4) vs (5, 3):\n(5, 3) is closer to the apple at (6, 5) by 1 step in Manhattan distance (6 vs 7).\n(4, 4) is closer to the top-center cluster (distance to (4, 8) is 4 vs 6).\nHowever, the top-center cluster is contested by Snake #1.\nSnake #1 is at (7, 9). Distance to (4, 8) is 6.\nSnake #1 is at (7, 9). Distance to (3, 9) is 5.\nSnake #1 is at (7, 9). Distance to (2, 9) is 6.\nSnake #1 is at (7, 9). Distance to (3, 8) is 5.\nI am at (4, 3). Distance to (4, 8) is 5.\nI am at (4, 3). Distance to (3, 9) is 7.\nI am at (4, 3). Distance to (3, 8) is 6.\nI am at (4, 3). Distance to (6, 5) is 5.\n\nSo I am competing for (6, 5) and (4, 8).\nSnake #1 is competing for (3, 9) and (3, 8).\nThe apples at (2, 9), (2, 6), (0, 0) are also there.\nThe apples at (8, 2) are far right.\nThe apples at (9, 0) and (8, 0) are bottom right.\n\nIf I move to (4, 4), I am securing a position that can pivot to (5, 4) or (3, 4).\nIf I move to (5, 3), I am committing to the right side.\nThe enemy is on the right side (x=7, y=9).\nEngaging the enemy directly on the right side (x>5) is risky.\nGoing to (4, 4) keeps me slightly left/center, giving me access to both the right apple (6, 5) and the top apples (4, 8) via the detour.\nAlso, (4, 4) is currently empty and safe.\n(5, 3) is empty and safe.\n\nLet's check adjacency.\nMy body occupies (4, 2).\nIf I go UP to (4, 3) (Wait, I am already at (4, 3) in this turn's start).\nI am deciding where to go from (4, 3).\nThe move is for the *next* turn (Turn 38).\nI am at (4, 3).\nI must move to (4, 4), (5, 3), or (4, 2) or (3, 3).\n(4, 2) is death (backwards).\n(3, 3) is death (into body).\nSo I must go UP or RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 4):\nI am safe.\nNext turn, I can go to (5, 4) or (4, 5) (if safe) or (3, 4).\n(3, 4) is `.`.\n(4, 5) is `.`.\n(5, 4) is `.`.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 3):\nI am safe.\nNext turn, I can go to (6, 3), (5, 4), or (5, 2).\n(5, 2) is `.`.\n(6, 3) is `.`.\n(5, 4) is `.`.\n\nThe board state shows `.` at (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3).\nBoth moves are valid.\nHowever, the apple at (6, 5) is a strong magnet.\nSnake #1 is likely to go for the apples at (3, 9) or (4, 8).\nIf I go to (5, 3), I am moving towards the \"danger zone\" near the enemy's body at (8, 1) and (8, 4).\nIf I go to (4, 4), I am staying in the center.\n\nLet's look at the long term.\nI have 9 apples. Enemy has 16.\nI need to eat faster.\nApple at (6, 5) is good.\nApple at (4, 8) is good.\nApple at (2, 6) is also close? (2, 6) is `A`.\nDistance from (4, 3) to (2, 6) is 5.\nDistance from (4, 3) to (6, 5) is 5.\nDistance from (4, 3) to (4, 8) is 5.\nAll are roughly equidistant.\n\nBut look at the board geometry.\nMy body stretches from (4, 2) down to (0, 6).\nI have a long tail.\nIf I go UP to (4, 4), I am moving away from my tail, giving it space to retract.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 3), I am moving parallel to my tail.\nMy tail is at (0, 6).\nMoving UP is generally safer for long snakes to avoid self-collision in tight spaces.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy's next move.\nEnemy is at (7, 9).\nPossible moves: (7, 8), (6, 9), (8, 9).\n(8, 9) is their body.\n(7, 8) is empty `.`.\n(6, 9) is `A`.\nIf they eat (6, 9), they grow.\nIf they go (7, 8), they move down.\nIf they go (6, 9), they move left.\nRegardless, they are far from me.\nI don't need to worry about immediate head-on collision.\n\nThe decision comes down to: Do I want to commit to the right side (Snake #1's side) or stay central?\nStaying central (UP to 4,4) seems better. It keeps options open.\nFrom (4, 4), I can reach (6, 5) in 2 moves (right, right-right? No, (4,4)->(5,4)->(6,5)). That's 2 moves.\nFrom (4, 4), I can reach (4, 8) in 4 moves (up, up, up, up? No, blocked at 4,6).\nActually, from (4, 4), (4, 5) is empty. (4, 6) is blocked by enemy body.\nSo I must go (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> (4, 6) blocked -> (4, 7).\nWait, (5, 5) is empty.\n(5, 6) is empty.\n(4, 6) is `T` (Enemy).\nSo (5, 6) -> (4, 6) is invalid.\nBut (5, 6) -> (5, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (4, 8) is valid.\nSo path to (4, 8) is: (4,4) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (5,6) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (4,8).\nThat's 6 moves from (4, 4).\n\nPath to (6, 5) from (4, 4):\n(4,4) -> (5,4) -> (6,5).\nThat's 2 moves.\n\nPath to (2, 6) from (4, 4):\n(4,4) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6).\n(2,5) is `A`? Row 5: `T . A . . . A . T`. (2, 5) is `A`.\nWait, (2, 5) is an apple. I missed that.\n(2, 5) is Apple.\nSo from (4, 4), I can go:\n(4,4) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) (Eat).\nThen (2,6) is also Apple.\n(2,4) is empty? Row 4: `T T . . . . . . T T`. (2, 4) is `.`.\n(3, 4) is `.`.\nSo (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) is a valid path to an apple.\nThis is much closer than (6, 5).\n(6, 5) is 2 moves from (4, 4). (2, 5) is 3 moves from (4, 4).\nHowever, (2, 5) is an immediate apple I can see.\n(2, 5) is Apple. (6, 5) is Apple.\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 4), I can pivot to (3, 4) and eat (2, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 3), I am further from (2, 5).\n(2, 5) is at x=2, y=5.\nMy tail is at (0, 6). My body goes (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3)...\nIf I go to (2, 5), I will be close to my own body.\nMy body: (2, 3), (3, 2)...\n(2, 5) is adjacent to (2, 4) (empty) and (1, 5) (empty?) Row 5: `T . A . . . A . T`. (1, 5) is `.`.\nSo (2, 5) is safe to eat.\n\nLet's verify if (2, 5) is safe to reach.\nFrom (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4).\n(3, 4) is empty.\n(2, 4) is empty.\nFrom (2, 4) -> (2, 5) (Apple).\n(2, 5) is Apple.\nIs (2, 5) occupied by enemy? No.\nIs it occupied by me? No.\nIs it out of bounds? No.\nSo (2, 5) is a valid target.\n\nComparing routes:\nRoute A (UP): (4,3) -> (4,4). Then options to (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) (Apple).\nRoute B (RIGHT): (4,3) -> (5,3). Then (5,4) -> (6,5) (Apple).\n\nRoute A gets an apple in 3 turns (if going for 2,5).\nRoute B gets an apple in 2 turns (if going for 6,5).\nRoute A is safer because it moves towards my tail's side (left side), leaving the right side for the enemy.\nRoute B moves towards the enemy's side (right side).\nThe enemy is strong (16 apples). I am weak (9 apples).\nI should avoid direct competition on the right side if possible.\nAlso, the apple at (2, 5) is in a relatively open space on the left.\nRow 5: `T . A . . . A . T`\n(0, 5) is `T` (My tail).\n(1, 5) is `.` (Empty).\n(2, 5) is `A` (Target).\n(3, 5) is `.` (Empty? Row 5 doesn't list x=3 explicitly but implied empty).\nWait, Row 5: `T . A . . . A . T`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nValues: T, ., A, ., ., ., A, ., ., T\nSo (3, 5) is `.`.\n(4, 5) is `.`.\n(5, 5) is `.`.\nSo there is space around (2, 5).\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 4), I am well positioned for (2, 5) and (6, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 3), I am less positioned for (2, 5).\nAlso, (4, 4) is safer for my tail.\nMy tail is at (0, 6).\nMy body segments: (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3)...\nIf I go to (5, 3), I am at x=5, y=3.\nMy tail is at x=0, y=6.\nDistance is large.\nIf I go to (4, 4), I am at x=4, y=4.\nStill large distance.\nBut (4, 4) is closer to the center.\n\nLet's look at the enemy again.\nSnake #1 is at (7, 9).\nIf they go LEFT to (6, 9) (Apple), they grow.\nIf they go DOWN to (7, 8), they are safe.\nIf they go DOWN to (7, 7) next, etc.\nThey are moving down the right side.\nI am on the left/center side.\nI should stay away from them.\nSo moving UP to (4, 4) is the correct choice to maintain distance and prepare for (2, 5) or (6, 5).\n\nWait, is there any reason to go RIGHT?\n(5, 3) is empty.\n(6, 3) is empty.\n(7, 3) is empty.\n(7, 4) is empty.\n(7, 5) is empty.\n(6, 5) is Apple.\nThis path is clear.\nBut the enemy is at (7, 9).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)...\nThey will eventually be at (7, 5).\nIf I am at (6, 5), I am next to (7, 5).\nIf I am at (5, 4), I am far.\nIf the enemy is at (7, 6), and I am at (6, 5), it's risky.\nIf the enemy is at (7, 5), and I am at (6, 5), we collide if I stay or move there when they arrive.\nDistance from (7, 9) to (7, 5) is 4 moves.\nDistance from (4, 3) to (6, 5) is 5 moves.\nSo if I race to (6, 5), I might arrive just as the enemy arrives at (7, 5).\nThis is risky.\nThe enemy is faster/more aggressive (16 apples).\nI should avoid this collision course.\n\nInstead, targeting (2, 5) is safer.\n(2, 5) is far from the enemy (x=2 vs x=7).\nMy body is at (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6).\n(2, 5) is adjacent to (1, 5).\n(1, 5) is empty.\n(2, 4) is empty.\n(3, 5) is empty.\nSo there is space.\nI can eat (2, 5) and then perhaps (2, 6) or (2, 9) or (3, 8).\nTo reach (2, 5), I need to go to (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5).\nThe first step is (4, 4).\n\nSo, moving UP to (4, 4) is the setup for the (2, 5) apple, which is safer than the (6, 5) apple.\n\nDouble check safety of (4, 4).\nRow 4: `. T T . . . . . T T` -> Wait, Row 4 is `T T . . . . . . T T`?\nNo, the provided board state is:\nRow 9: `. A A A . . . 1 T .`\nRow 8: `. . . A A . . T T .`\nRow 7: `. . . . . . . T T .`\nRow 6: `T .

T`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nValues: ., T, T, ., ., ., ., ., ., T\nSo (3, 3) is `.`.\n(4, 3) is `.`.\nSo my move to (4, 3) was correct and I am currently safe.\n\nNow, moving to (4, 4).\nRow 4: `T T . . . . . . T T`\n(4, 4) is `.`.\nThis is safe.\n\nSo the plan is solid: Go UP to (4, 4) to position for (2, 5).\n\nWait, is there any risk of enemy moving to (4, 4)?\nEnemy is at (7, 9). Distance 7.\nNo.\n\nWhat about my own tail?\nMy tail is at (0, 6).\nIf I go (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5)...\nMy tail will move.\nIf I eat (2, 5), I grow.\nSo my tail won't move (I grow by 1).\nWait, if I eat an apple, my tail stays for that turn.\nIf I don't eat, my tail moves forward.\nIf I don't eat on (4, 4), my tail moves.\nMy tail is at (0, 6).\nThe segment in front of tail is (0, 5).\nIf I move to (4, 4), my tail moves to (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> ...\nActually, the tail moves one step forward along the path.\nSo the segment at (0, 6) becomes (0, 5).\nThe segment at (0, 5) becomes (0, 4).\nThe segment at (0, 4) becomes (1, 4).\n...\nThe segment at (4, 2) becomes (4, 3).\nSo my body effectively \"slides\" forward.\n(4, 2) -> (4, 3).\n(3, 2) -> (4, 2).\n(2, 2) -> (3, 2).\n(2, 3) -> (2, 2).\n(1, 3) -> (2, 3).\n(1, 4) -> (1, 3).\n(0, 4) -> (1, 4).\n(0, 5) -> (0, 4).\n(0, 6) -> (0, 5).\nNew head at (4, 4).\n\nIf I then move to (3, 4) (Turn 39):\nHead (3, 4).\nBody slides.\n(4, 4) -> (4, 3).\n(4, 3) -> (4, 2).\n(4, 2) -> (3, 2).\n(3, 2) -> (2, 2).\n(2, 2) -> (2, 3).\n(2, 3) -> (1, 3).\n(1, 3) -> (1, 4).\n(1, 4) -> (0, 4).\n(0, 4) -> (0, 5).\n(0, 5) -> (0, 6).\nNew head at (3, 4).\n\nIf I then move to (2, 4) (Turn 40):\nHead (2, 4).\nBody slides.\n(3, 4) -> (3, 3).\n(4, 4) -> (3, 4).\n(4, 3) -> (4, 2).\n(4, 2) -> (3, 2).\n(3, 2) -> (2, 2).\n(2, 2) -> (2, 3).\n(2, 3) -> (1, 3).\n(1, 3) -> (1, 4).\n(1, 4) -> (0, 4).\n(0, 4) -> (0, 5).\n(0, 5) -> (0, 6).\nNew head at (2, 4).\n\nIf I then move to (2, 5) (Turn 41):\nHead (2, 5) (Apple).\nI eat.

So 10 body parts including head?\n\"Snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\nMy list: `[(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]`\nLength is 9.\nSo I am length 10 (Head + 9 body parts).\nIf I move UP to (4, 4), new head is (4, 4).\nNew body: `[(4, 4), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]`? No.\nThe old head becomes body part 1.\nThe old body part 1 becomes body part 2...\nThe old tail is removed.\nSo:\nOld Head: (4, 3) -> New Body 1\nOld Body 1: (4, 2) -> New Body 2\n...\nOld Body 8: (0, 6) -> Removed.\nSo new list: `[(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5)]`\nLength is 10.\nCheck for collisions in new list.\n(4, 4) is distinct.\n(4, 3) is distinct.\n(4, 2) is distinct.\n...\n(0, 5) is distinct.\nAll distinct. No self-collision.\nCheck for wall collision.\n(4, 4) is within 0-9.\nCheck for enemy collision.\n(4, 4) is empty.\nSo UP is safe.\n\nDecision confirmed.\n\nUP",

Positions me closer to `(4, 8)`. `(4, 6)` is enemy body, but `(4, 7)` is empty, providing a path `(4, 5) -> (4, 6)` is blocked, so I would need to go `(4, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> (4, 7)`. This is a valid future path.\n    *   **RIGHT `(5, 4)`:** Safe. Leads toward `(6, 5)` apple. Path `(5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 5)` is clear.\n    *   **LEFT `(3, 4)`:** Safe. Leads toward `(2, 5)` apple. Path `(3, 4) -> (3, 5) -> (2, 5)` is clear.\n\n3.  **Strategic Plan (Next 2 Turns):**\n    *   **Option A (Go for Apple `A` at (2,5)):**\n        *   Current Turn (38): **LEFT** to `(3, 4)`.\n        *   Next Turn (39): **UP** or **LEFT** to `(2, 5)`.\n        *   *Benefit:* Safe, avoids enemy (who is at x=6-7), fills the empty corridor on the left.\n        *   *Risk:* None immediate.\n    *   **Option B (Go for Apple `A` at (6,5)):**\n        *   Current Turn (38): **RIGHT** to `(5, 4)`.\n        *   Next Turn (39): **RIGHT** to `(6, 4)`, then **UP** to `(6, 5)`.\n        *   *Benefit:* Direct path to apple.\n        *   *Risk:* `(6, 5)` is adjacent to `(7, 5)` and `(6, 6)`. Enemy is at `(6, 9)` but moves fast (score 16 implies high speed). Engaging near `(6, 5)` brings me close to the enemy's territory (right side). If the enemy drops down to `(7, 8)` or `(7, 7)`, they become a direct threat. **This is risky.**\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   The enemy is occupied in the top-right (x=6, y=9) looking at apples like `(3, 9)`.\n    *   The apples on the left side `(2, 5)`, `(2, 6)`, `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)` are safer and less contested.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** allows me to pivot to `(2, 5)` next turn safely. `(3, 4)` is empty, and `(3, 5)` is empty. `(2, 5)` is an apple.\n    *   Moving **UP** commits me to the vertical center which is contested at `(4, 6)` (enemy body) and might lead to a head-on collision if the enemy decides to drop down from the top.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** is the most aggressive but risks running into the enemy's path of travel. Given the score difference (9 vs 16), playing defensively to secure the apples on the left is better than contesting the center/right.\n\n    **Choice:** `LEFT` to `(3, 4)`.\n    This secures a path to the `(2, 5)` apple without putting my head in the enemy's immediate vicinity.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "My head is at `(3, 4)`. I am analyzing the board to determine the safest and most strategic move for Turn 39.\n\n**1. Current State Analysis:**\n- **My position:** Head at `(3, 4)`. Body follows: `(4, 4)`, `(4, 3)`, `(4, 2)`, `(3, 2)`, `(2, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, `(1, 3)`, `(1, 4)`, `(0, 4)`.\n- **Enemy position:** Snake #1 Head at `(5, 9)`. Body fills the top right quadrant.\n- **Apples:** I see apples at `(2, 5)`, `(2, 6)`, `(3, 8)`, `(3, 9)` on the left/center side, which are relatively safe. The apple at `(6, 5)` is near the enemy's body path.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (from head `(3, 4)`):**\n- **UP to `(3, 5)`:** Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN to `(3, 3)`:** Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT to `(2, 4)`:** Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to `(4, 4)`:** My own body (the neck). **DEADLY**.\n\n**3. Strategic Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Moving UP to `(3, 5)`:**\n    *   This moves me toward the apple at `(2, 5)` and the cluster `(3, 8)`, `(3, 9)`.\n    *   `(3, 5)` is a safe coordinate.\n    *   From `(3, 5)`, I can access `(2, 5)` (Apple) or `(3, 6)`.\n    *   This keeps me in the left/center area, away from the enemy who is currently at `(5, 9)` (top-right).\n    *   **Long-term plan:** Eat `(2, 5)`, then `(2, 6)`. If safe, move up to `(3, 8)` or `(3, 9)`.\n    *   **Risk:** The enemy is long and might sweep down later, but currently, the left side is open.\n\n*   **Moving DOWN to `(3, 3)`:**\n    *   This moves me away from the apples. `(3, 3)` is empty.\n    *   From here, I could move to `(2, 3)` (which is part of my tail on the previous turn, but will be free on the *next* turn if I don't loop).\n    *   However, moving down takes me away from the immediate apples `(2, 5)` and `(3, 8)`. I would have to climb back up.\n    *   This is less efficient for scoring.\n\n*   **Moving LEFT to `(2, 4)`:**\n    *   This moves me closer to `(2, 5)`.\n    *   `(2, 4)` is empty.\n    *   From `(2, 4)`, I can go UP to `(2, 5)` (Apple) or LEFT to `(1, 4)`.\n    *   However, `(1, 4)` is my tail (from the previous turn). If I go LEFT to `(2, 4)`, on the *next* turn, `(1, 4)` might be occupied by my body if I haven't moved away from it fast enough, but looking at the body chain: `(3, 2)->(2, 2)->(2, 3)->(1, 3)->(1, 4)->(0, 4)`.\n    *   If I move LEFT to `(2, 4)`, my head is at `(2, 4)`. My body moves up: `(3, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, etc.\n    *   Wait, if I move LEFT to `(2, 4)`, the tail `(0, 4)` will move to `(1, 4)`.\n    *   So on the *next* turn, if I am at `(2, 4)`, `(1, 4)` will be occupied by my tail.\n    *   This means if I go LEFT to `(2, 4)` now, on the next turn I cannot go LEFT to `(1, 4)`.\n    *   This restricts my movement slightly compared to going UP.\n    *   However, going LEFT to `(2, 4)` puts me directly adjacent to the apple at `(2, 5)`.\n\n**4. Comparison:**\n- **UP `(3, 5)`**: Good position. Future options: `(2, 5)`, `(3, 6)`, `(4, 5)`. Safe.\n- **LEFT `(2, 4)`**: Good position. Future options: `(2, 5)` (Apple), `(1, 4)` (Blocked by tail on next turn), `(2, 3)` (Empty? My body is at `(4, 3)`, `(4, 2)`, `(3, 2)`, `(2, 2)`, `(2, 3)`. Wait, `(2, 3)` is part of my current body!\n    *   My body: `... (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4)...`\n    *   If I move to `(2, 4)`, I must check if `(2, 3)` is safe for the *next* move.\n    *   Yes, `(2, 3)` is part of my body. I cannot go DOWN to `(2, 3)`.\n    *   So from `(2, 4)`, valid next moves: UP `(2, 5)` (Apple), LEFT `(1, 4)` (Blocked by tail), DOWN `(2, 3)` (Body).\n    *   This means from `(2, 4)`, I am effectively funneled to `(2, 5)` or `(1, 4)` (blocked).\n    *   Actually, from `(2, 4)`, if I don't eat the apple at `(2, 5)`, I am trapped. If I do eat it, I grow.\n    *   Let's look at `UP` to `(3, 5)`. From there:\n        *   UP `(3, 6)` (Empty)\n        *   LEFT `(2, 5)` (Apple)\n        *   RIGHT `(4, 5)` (Empty)\n        *   DOWN `(3, 4)` (Body, but moves away).\n    *   `UP` to `(3, 5)` offers more flexibility (Left, Up, Right) than `LEFT` to `(2, 4)` (Up, Left [blocked by tail]).\n\n**5. Risk Assessment:**\n- Enemy is at `(5, 9)`. They are far away.\n- Moving `UP` to `(3, 5)` allows me to pivot. If the enemy moves down aggressively, I can move Right to `(4, 5)` or Up to `(3, 6)`.\n- Moving `LEFT` to `(2, 4)` creates a potential bottleneck if I don't grab the apple immediately or if the enemy surprises me from the top.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving `UP` to `(3, 5)` is the safest and most flexible move. It keeps me close to the apple at `(2, 5)` (which I can grab next turn) and opens up paths to `(3, 8)` and `(3, 9)` or retreat paths to the right. It avoids the immediate trap of `(2, 4)` where my movement options are severely limited by my own body.\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to (3, 5). Next turn, move LEFT to (2, 5) to eat the apple, unless the enemy poses a direct threat, in which case I can move UP to (3, 6) or RIGHT to (4, 5).\n\nUP",

However, looking ahead, `x=3` is a vertical channel. Above `(3, 6)` are apples at `(3, 8)` and `(3, 9)`. To reach them, I must pass through `(3, 7)`.\n    -   `(3, 7)` is empty.\n    -   `(3, 8)` is an apple (worth 1 point).\n    -   `(3, 9)` is an apple (worth 1 point).\n    -   This is a **straight vertical tunnel**.\n    -   If I enter this tunnel, I am committing to a linear path. The enemy is currently at `(4, 9)`, right next to `(3, 9)`.\n    -   If the enemy moves to `(3, 9)` (which is a valid move from `(4, 9)` DOWN), and I move UP to `(3, 6)`, the distance between us decreases. If I eventually reach `(3, 8)` or `(3, 9)`, the enemy could potentially collide with me or cut me off.\n    -   More importantly, once inside a 1-block wide tunnel, my movement options are zero. I am forced to go UP or DOWN. If the enemy anticipates this, they can position themselves to block or kill me on the next turn.\n\n2.  **DOWN to `(3, 4)`:** This is my own neck. **DEADLY.** (Wait, looking at the body list: `[(3, 4), ...]` is indeed the first element of the body list, which is the cell immediately behind the head). Moving DOWN into `(3, 4)` is suicide.\n\n3.  **LEFT to `(2, 5)`:** This is an **Apple**.\n    -   This moves me towards the apples at `(2, 6)`.\n    -   From `(2, 5)`, I can move UP to `(2, 6)` (Apple) or LEFT to `(1, 5)` (Empty).\n    -   The area to the left (`x < 3`) is relatively open.\n    -   Eating the apple grows my body, which is generally good, but also creates more obstacles for myself.\n    -   However, `LEFT` to `(2, 5)` keeps me out of the narrow vertical tunnel at `x=3` where I am vulnerable to a head-on collision from the enemy coming down from the top.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to `(4, 5)`:** This is empty.\n    -   From `(4, 5)`, I can move UP to `(4, 6)`.\n    -   However, `x=4` is dangerous. The enemy snake's body occupies `(4, 9)` and stretches all the way down to `(8, 1)`. While `(4, 5)` is currently empty, `x=4` is a risky column because it is adjacent to the enemy's main body axis.\n    -   Moving RIGHT also moves me closer to the enemy's current position `(4, 9)` (Manhattan distance decreases from 5 to 4).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nAvoid the vertical tunnel at `x=3`.\n-   Going UP into the tunnel at `(3, 6)` limits my future moves. If the enemy decides to move down or block, I am trapped.\n-   The enemy has 16 apples. I have 9. I need to be aggressive but safe.\n-   The apple at `(2, 5)` is a guaranteed point.\n-   After eating `(2, 5)`, my body will extend. The cell `(2, 5)` will be occupied by my body on the *next* turn.\n-   From `(2, 5)`, my viable moves are UP `(2, 6)` (Apple) or LEFT `(1, 5)` (Empty).\n-   This gives me flexibility to either continue collecting apples in the open area or retreat left.\n\n**Comparison of Safety:**\n-   **UP (3, 6):** Leads to a trap if enemy engages. High risk of collision in narrow space.\n-   **LEFT (2, 5):** Secure an apple immediately. Open area to the left. If enemy attacks, I can retreat left or continue grabbing apples.\n-   **RIGHT (4, 5):** Moves towards enemy's territory.\n\n**Conclusion:** The safest and most productive move is **LEFT** to eat the apple at `(2, 5)`. This provides an immediate score increase and avoids the risky vertical channel at `x=3`.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (2, 5) to eat the apple. Next turn, I will likely move UP to (2, 6) to eat another apple, unless the enemy moves to block or threaten that square. I will avoid getting pinned at `x=3`.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

My previous body segment is `(3, 5)`.\n    -   If I move UP to `(2, 6)`, I will be adjacent to `(3, 6)` (which is empty).\n    -   Risk: Getting trapped in a tunnel.\n    -   Reward: Apple at `(2, 6)`.\n\n2.  **DOWN to `(2, 4)`**:\n    -   Looking at the board map: `.` at `(2, 4)`.\n    -   My body is at `(3, 5)`, `(3, 4)`, `(4, 4)`.\n    -   `(2, 4)` is empty.\n    -   This is a safe move. It moves towards the bottom of the board where there are apples `(2, 0)` and `(0, 0)`.\n    -   This avoids the potential trap of the vertical tunnel at `x=2` (where I might get blocked by the enemy who is at `(3, 9)` or `(4, 9)`).\n\n3.  **LEFT to `(1, 5)`**:\n    -   Board map shows `.` at `(1, 5)`.\n    -   My body starts at `(3, 5)`, so `(1, 5)` is safe.\n    -   This moves towards `(1, 4)` (part of my tail, but it will move) and opens up the left side.\n    -   Safe.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to `(3, 5)`**:\n    -   **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** `(3, 5)` is the first segment of my body (the neck).\n\n**Decision Process:**\nAvoid `(3, 5)` (Right).\n`Up (2, 6)` grabs an apple but leads into a narrow vertical column. If the enemy moves down or cuts off the escape, I am trapped.\n`Left (1, 5)` and `Down (2, 4)` are safer, keeping options open.\n\nLet's look at the enemy. Enemy head is `(3, 9)`. The enemy body occupies `(4, 9)` down to `(8, 1)`.\nThe enemy is trapped in the top-right corner and the right edge. They cannot go Left to `(2, 9)` because that is an apple and potentially open, or blocked?\nWait, the enemy body at `(4, 9)` blocks `(4, 9)`.\nThe cell `(3, 9)` is the enemy head.\nThe cell `(2, 9)` is an apple. It is open.\nThe cell `(3, 8)` is an apple. It is open.\nThe enemy is very long and constrained.\n\nIf I go UP to `(2, 6)`, I am moving into the vertical strip at `x=2`.\nIf the enemy goes DOWN (which is unlikely to kill me immediately unless they go all the way), I might be safe.\nHowever, if I go UP, I commit to the vertical path.\nIf I go DOWN, I move toward `(2, 0)`.\nIf I go LEFT, I move toward `(0, 0)` and `(1, 2)`.\n\nLet's compare `UP` vs `LEFT` vs `DOWN`.\n**UP**: Immediate point. High future potential (apples at `(2, 9)`, `(2, 0)`). Risk: Tunnel trap.\n**LEFT**: No immediate point. Safe. Moves towards `(0, 0)`.\n**DOWN**: No immediate point. Safe. Moves towards `(2, 0)`.\n\nGiven that the enemy is busy in the top-right corner (very far away from me, 7-8 tiles Manhattan distance), I have time to maneuver.\nHowever, avoiding tunnels is usually the best strategy to prevent head-on collisions or getting boxed in.\nThe `UP` move creates a tunnel at `x=2`.\nThe `LEFT` move is completely open.\nThe `DOWN` move is open towards the bottom.\n\nBut, `(2, 6)` is an apple. It's right there. Not taking it feels like a waste, especially since I am currently at `(2, 5)`.\nIf I take it, I am at `(2, 6)`. The only way I die immediately is if the enemy moves to `(2, 6)` (impossible, distance 7+) or I hit myself (impossible).\nThe danger is the *next* turn.\nIf I go UP to `(2, 6)`, my body is `(2, 5), (3, 5), ...`\nNext turn, I can go UP to `(2, 7)` or LEFT to `(1, 6)` or RIGHT to `(3, 6)`.\nThis keeps options open.\nThe \"tunnel\" at `x=2` is not a 1-wide tunnel in the sense of being surrounded by walls. It is a vertical column of empty space.\nIf I go UP, I am at `(2, 6)`.\nIf I go DOWN, I am at `(2, 4)`.\nIf I go LEFT, I am at `(1, 5)`.\n\nLet's consider the long-term plan.\nMy score is 10. Enemy is 17. I am losing.\nI need apples.\nThe apples near me are at `(2, 6)`, `(2, 9)`, `(2, 0)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 9)`, `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`.\nThe cluster at `x=0,1,2` is rich.\nThe enemy is stuck at `x=3..9`.\nI should secure the apples in my sector.\n\nIs `(2, 6)` safe?\nIf I move UP to `(2, 6)`:\n- My head: `(2, 6)`\n- My body: `(2, 5), (3, 5), ...`\n- Enemy head: `(3, 9)` (likely moves DOWN to `(3, 8)` or LEFT to `(2, 9)`, etc.)\n- Enemy body: `(4, 9)...`\n\nIf I move DOWN to `(2, 4)`:\n- My head: `(2, 4)`\n- My body: `(2, 5), (3, 5)...`\n- This is safe.\n- But I don't gain a point.\n\nIf I move LEFT to `(1, 5)`:\n- My head: `(1, 5)`\n- My body: `(2, 5), (3, 5)...`\n- Safe. No point.\n\nThe best move is usually to eat the apple if it doesn't lead to immediate death or a guaranteed trap.\nHere, the \"tunnel\" is open on both sides at `x=2`.\n`(2, 6)` -> `(2, 7)` (empty) -> `(2, 8)` (empty) -> `(2, 9)` (apple).\nI can chain these moves.\nThe enemy is at `(3, 9)`.\nIf I go UP, I will be at `(2, 6)`.\nIf the enemy goes LEFT to `(2, 9)`, they will eat the apple there. But they are long. Their body is at `(4, 9)`.\nIf I continue going UP, I will reach `(2, 9)` potentially.\nIf the enemy goes to `(2, 9)`, we might collide.\nLet's trace a collision:\nTurn 42 (This turn): I move UP to `(2, 6)`. Enemy moves (say) LEFT to `(2, 9)`.\nTurn 43: I move UP to `(2, 7)`. Enemy moves (say) DOWN to `(2, 8)`.\nTurn 44: I move UP to `(2, 8)`. Enemy moves (say) DOWN to `(2, 7)`.\nThis is a head-on collision path.\nHowever, the enemy is at `(3, 9)`. They might not go LEFT. They might go DOWN to `(3, 8)`.\nIf the enemy goes DOWN, they are moving away from me.\nIf the enemy goes LEFT to `(2, 9)`, they are eating an apple.\nIf I go UP, I am eating an apple.\nIf we both go for the same line (`x=2`), it's risky.\nBut I am at `y=5`. They are at `y=9`.\nWe are 4 tiles apart vertically.\nIf I go UP, I decrease the distance.\nIf I go DOWN, I increase the distance.\nIf I go LEFT, I move laterally away.\n\nGiven that I need to catch up in score (10 vs 17), I should take risks to eat apples.\nTaking the apple at `(2, 6)` is a high-value move.\nLet's check if I get trapped.\nIf I am at `(2, 6)`, my body is at `(2, 5)`.\nIf I go UP again to `(2, 7)`, my body is at `(2, 6), (2, 5)`.\nIf I go LEFT to `(1, 6)`, my body is at `(2, 6), (2, 5)`.\nI am not trapped.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves to `(3, 6)`? No, they are at `(3, 9)`, distance 3. They can't reach `(3, 6)` this turn.\nWhat if the enemy moves to `(3, 8)` (Down)? That puts them adjacent to me at `(2, 6)`? No, `(3, 8)` is adjacent to `(2, 8)` and `(3, 9)`. Not `(2, 6)`.\n`(2, 6)` is safe from immediate collision.\n\nThe only danger is the \"future tunnel\" argument.\nHowever, looking at the board, `x=2` is a column of empty space mostly.\n`(2, 0)` is an apple.\n`(2, 1)` is empty (`.`).\n`(2, 2)` is my body (tail).\nWait, `(2, 2)` is listed in my body: `[(3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), ...]`\nSo my tail is currently at `(1, 4)`.\nWait, the list is head-to-tail.\nHead: `(2, 5)`\nBody: `(3, 5)`... `(1, 4)`.\nSo my tail is `(1, 4)`.\n`(2, 2)` is part of my body, but not the tail.\nSo `x=2` is partially occupied by my own body at `(2, 2)` and `(2, 3)`.\nAnd `(2, 5)` is my head *this turn* (but will become body next turn).\nSo `x=2` has: `(2, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, `(2, 5)` (current head, becomes body), `(2, 6)` (target).\nThis means the column `x=2` has gaps: `(2, 4)` is empty.\nIf I go to `(2, 6)`, the path is `(2, 5)`, `(2, 4)`, `(2, 3)`, `(2, 2)`.\nI can go DOWN to `(2, 4)` next turn if needed.\nSo `x=2` is not a closed tunnel. It's an open path.\n\nSo, `UP` to `(2, 6)` is safe and productive.\n\nWhat about `LEFT`?\n`LEFT` to `(1, 5)`. This moves me away from the `x=2` column.\nFrom `(1, 5)`, I can go to `(1, 4)` (my tail, which will move), `(1, 6)` (empty), `(0, 5)` (empty).\nThis is also safe. But no immediate point.\n\nI am trailing 17 to 10. I need points.\nThe apple at `(2, 6)` is ripe for the taking.\nI will take it.\n\nOne check: Enemy at `(3, 9)`.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to `(3, 8)`.\nIf I move UP to `(2, 6)`.\nDistance is safe.\nIf enemy moves LEFT to `(2, 9)`.\nIf I move UP to `(2, 6)`.\nDistance is safe.\nIf enemy moves DOWN-LEFT (hypothetically), they can't reach me.\n\nLet's consider the \"Do Not\" list.\n1. Right to `(3, 5)` -> Suicide (into my body).\n2. Down to `(2, 4)` -> Safe, no apple.\n3. Left to `(1, 5)` -> Safe, no apple.\n4. Up to `(2, 6)` -> Safe, Apple.\n\nThe decision is between `UP` (Apple) and `LEFT` (Safety/No Apple).\nIn Snake games, \"safety\" often means avoiding getting trapped.\nAm I trapped by going `UP`?\nMy head: `(2, 6)`.\nMy body: `(2, 5), (3, 5), ...`\nMy next moves from `(2, 6)`:\n- `UP` to `(2, 7)` (Empty)\n- `LEFT` to `(1, 6)` (Empty)\n- `RIGHT` to `(3, 6)` (Empty)\n- `DOWN` to `(2, 5)` (My body, death).\nI have 3 safe moves. This is the definition of being open.\n\nTherefore, `UP` is the optimal move. It gains a point and keeps me open.\n\nFinal check on the \"Start Last Move Pick\" section in the prompt.\nIt says: \"LEFT\".\nThis confirms my previous turn's logic was to go to `(2, 5)`.\nAnd now I am at `(2, 5)`.\nSo the state provided is the *result* of my previous move.\nWait, if the state is the result, and my head is `(2, 5)`, then I have already moved to `(2, 5)`.\nDid I eat an apple at `(2, 5)`?\nThe apple list does not include `(2, 5)`.\nSo `LEFT` was just a movement.\nNow I am at `(2, 5)`.\nThere is an apple at `(2, 6)`.\nSo I should move UP.\n\nWait, if the prompt says \"Turn: 41 / 150\" and gives the state, and the \"Last Move\" was LEFT, then I am at `(2, 5)`.\nThe visual map shows `0` at `(3, 5)`.\nThis is a contradiction in the prompt.\n\"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (2, 5)\"\nVisual map:\n`5 . . 0 T . . A . T .`\n`0` is at column 3 (x=3).\n`(2, 5)` is column 2 (x=2).\nSo the text description \"Head: (2, 5)\" is inconsistent with the visual map \"0 at x=3, y=5\".\n\nWhich one to trust?\nUsually, the text description \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (2, 5)\" is the ground truth for logic. The visual map might be slightly off or I might be misreading the visual map's coordinates.\nLet's re-read the coordinate reminder: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nVisual Map:\nRow 5 (y=5):\nColumns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...\n`5 . . 0 T . . A . T .`\nIndex 0: .\nIndex 1: .\nIndex 2: .\nIndex 3: 0\nSo `0` is at x=3, y=5.\nThis corresponds to coordinate (3, 5).\nThe text says Head: (2, 5).\n\nIf the text says (2, 5) and the map says (3, 5), and the \"Last Move\" was \"LEFT\", then:\n- If I was at (3, 5) and moved LEFT, I go to (2, 5).\n- If the text says I am at (2, 5), and the map shows (3, 5), the map might be showing the *previous* state or is just a visual representation that isn't perfectly aligned with the coordinate system in the text.\n- However, the text \"Head: (2, 5)\" is explicit data.\n- The \"Last Move: LEFT\" implies I moved from (3, 5) to (2, 5).\n- So, I am likely at (2, 5).\n\nIf I am at (2, 5):\n- Cell (2, 6) is an apple.\n- Cell (3, 5) is my body (the neck).\n- Cell (1, 5) is empty.\n- Cell (2, 4) is empty.\n- Cell (2, 5) is my head.\n\nIf I am at (3, 5) (per map):\n- Cell (3, 6) is empty.\n- Cell (2, 5) is an apple (per apple list? No, apple list has (2, 6), (2, 9)... (2, 5) is NOT in the apple list).\n- Cell (4, 5) is empty.\n- Cell (3, 4) is my body (neck).\n\nLet's assume the text \"Head: (2, 5)\" is correct because it contains the specific coordinate data used to describe the state.\nIf I am at (2, 5):\n- Apple at (2, 6) (Up).\n- Open at (1, 5) (Left).\n- Open at (2, 4) (Down).\n- Suicide at (3, 5) (Right).\n\nSo the plan is: Move UP to eat the apple at (2, 6).\n\nWhat if the map is correct and I am at (3, 5)?\nThen:\n- Apple at (2, 5) is NOT there.\n- Apple at (3, 6) is NOT there.\n- Apple at (2, 6) is there.\n- From (3, 5), Up is (3, 6) (Empty). Left is (2, 5) (Empty). Down is (3, 4) (Body). Right is (4, 5) (Empty).\n- The apple is at (2, 6) (Up-Left diagonal).\n- From (3, 5), I can go UP to (3, 6). Then next turn I can go LEFT to (2, 6).\n- Or I can go LEFT to (2, 5). Then next turn UP to (2, 6).\n\nIf I am at (3, 5), the \"Last Move\" was LEFT from (4, 5)?\nThe prompt says \"Your last move information: START LAST MOVE PICK LEFT\". \nIf I am at (3, 5), I moved LEFT from (4, 5).\nThis matches the map (0 at x=3).\nSo likely I am at (3, 5) and the text \"(2, 5)\" in the state description is a typo or refers to something else (maybe tail? No, tail is (1, 4)).\nLet's look at the body list: `[(3, 5), (3, 4), ...]` in the state description? No, the state description says:\nHead: (2, 5)\nBody: [(3, 5), ...]\nIf Head is (2, 5), Body starts at (3, 5). This makes sense.\nBut the map shows Head at (3, 5).\nThis is a conflict between the map and the text list.\n\nHowever, the text list is usually generated by the game logic and is more reliable for coordinates.\nIf the text list says Head (2, 5), I should play as if I am at (2, 5).\nIf I am at (2, 5), I move UP to (2, 6) to eat the apple.\nIf I am at (3, 5) (per map), moving UP goes to (3, 6) which is empty.\nMoving LEFT goes to (2, 5) which is empty.\n\nLet's look at the apple list again: `(2, 6), (0, 0), (2, 9), (4, 8), (1, 2), (3, 8), (2, 0), (8, 2), (9, 0), (6, 5), (1, 9), (8, 0), (0, 1), (4, 0), (6, 4)`\nIf I am at (2, 5), (2, 6) is an apple. This is a very good move.\nIf I am at (3, 5), (3, 6) is empty. (2, 6) is an apple. I cannot reach (2, 6) this turn. I can only reach it by going UP-LEFT (not allowed) or UP then LEFT (2 turns).\nFrom (3, 5), the best move is likely UP to (3, 6) to set up for (2, 6) or (3, 8) or (3, 9).\n\nLet's assume the text description is the ground truth for coordinates.\n\"Head: (2, 5)\" -> Move UP to (2, 6) to eat apple.\nLet's assume the map is the ground truth (visual representation).\n\"0 at x=3, y=5\" -> Move UP to (3, 6) to open path.\n\nWhich is more likely to be a typo?\nThe text \"Head: (2, 5)\" is very specific. The map is a visual ASCII art.\nAlso, the body list: `[(3, 5), ...]`. If head is (2, 5) and body starts (3, 5), that means I moved LEFT this turn.\nThe prompt says \"Your last move information: ... LEFT\".\nThis matches the text description perfectly.\nI was at (3, 5), I moved LEFT, now I am at (2, 5).\nThe map might not have been updated or is showing the previous frame.\nTherefore, I am at (2, 5).\nThe move UP to (2, 6) is the apple move.\n\nIs there any other danger at (2, 6)?\nMy body will be (2, 5), (3, 5), ...\nIf I move UP to (2, 6), I am safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 5), I am safe but no apple.\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 4), safe no apple.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 5), death.\n\nI will choose UP.\n\nLong-term plan: \nSecure the apple at (2, 6). Then move to (2, 9) or (2, 0) depending on enemy position. The enemy is at (3, 9), so (2, 9) is contested. If the enemy moves to (2, 9), I should avoid collision. If the enemy stays away, I can eat it. I must avoid getting trapped in the vertical column `x=2` if the enemy blocks the ends, but currently, the enemy is far away. I will proceed UP to the top to collect the cluster of apples there, as the bottom cluster is also accessible but requires passing through (2, 2) which is my own body (currently at (2, 2)). Actually, (2, 2) is part of my body, so I can't go through there. I have to go around. Going UP seems more direct.\n\nWait, looking at my body: `[(3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4)]`\nMy body occupies `(2, 2)`. So to get to `(2, 0)` from `(2, 5)`, I have to go through `(2, 4), (2, 3)`. `(2, 3)` is occupied by my body!\nSo I cannot go DOWN to `(2, 0)` directly because my body is in the way at `(2, 3)` and `(2, 2)`.\nI would have to go LEFT or RIGHT to bypass my own body.\nSo going UP is actually the only clear path to more apples on this vertical line.\nThe bottom apples `(2, 0)` are blocked by my own tail (which is at `(1, 4)`, but `(2, 3)` and `(2, 2)` are in the way).\nSo UP is the only productive direction.\n\nTherefore, UP is the correct move.\n\nOne final check. If I am at (2, 5), can I move DOWN to (2, 4)?\nYes.\nCan I move LEFT to (1, 5)?\nYes.\nCan I move UP to (2, 6)?\nYes.\nCan I move RIGHT to (3, 5)?\nNo (Death).\n\nComparing (2, 6), (2, 4), (1, 5):\n(2, 6) has an apple.\n(2, 4) is empty.\n(1, 5) is empty.\n(2, 6) is the clear winner.\n\nI will output UP.\n\nOne edge case: The enemy at (3, 9) could move to (3, 8). If I go UP to (2, 6), the distance is large. Safe.\nIf the enemy moves to (2, 9) (Left), distance is large. Safe.\n\nI am confident in UP.\n\nThe prompt asks: \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nMy body is at (3, 5), (2, 2)...\nEnemy body is at (4, 9)... (8, 1).\nNone of these are in the way of (2, 6).\n\nI will write a rationale and then the move.\n\nThe rationale should be concise but cover the logic:\n1. State confirmation (Head at 2,5).\n2. Move options (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n3. Elimination (Right is death).\n4. Comparison (Up gives apple, Down/Left empty).\n5. Safety (Up is open, blocked by my own body below).\n6. Strategy (Need points to catch up, 2,6 is safe and productive).\n\nI will add a plan for the next turn.\nPlan: Move UP to (2,6). Next turn, move UP to (2,7) to approach (2,9) or (3,8) depending on enemy.\n\nFinal check on the \"Last Move Rationale\" provided in the prompt.\nIt says \"My Head: (3, 5)\".\nWait. The \"START LAST RATIONALE\" says:\n\"- **My Head:** `(3, 5)`\"\nThis is different from the \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (2, 5)\" section.\nThe \"START LAST RATIONALE\" seems to be from the *previous* turn (Turn 40), describing the state *before* the move.\nThe \"Your snake (ID: 0)\" section describes the *current* state (Turn 41).\nSo:\nTurn 40: Head at (3, 5). I moved LEFT.\nTurn 41: Head at (2, 5). I need to move.\n\nThis resolves the conflict.\nI am at (2, 5).\n\nMove: UP.\n\nOne specific check on the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" text.\nIt says \"My Head: (3, 5)\" (Old state).\nIt says \"The apple at (2, 5) is a guaranteed point.\" (Old rationale).\nIt says \"Plan: Move LEFT to (2, 5)\".\nSo the previous plan was to eat the apple at (2, 5).\nBUT, the apple list in the current state does NOT include (2, 5).\nThe apple list includes (2, 6).\nSo the previous rationale assumed (2, 5) was an apple, but the current state shows it is NOT.\nThis means I moved to (2, 5) and did NOT eat an apple.\nThis is slightly disappointing, but explains why (2, 5) is just empty space in the current state description (though the text says Head is there).\nWait, if I am at (2, 5), and it was not an apple, then I did not grow.\nMy body is still (3, 5)...\nSo (2, 5) is just a step.\n\nNow, from (2, 5), the apple is at (2, 6).\nI should go UP.\n\nIf I go UP, I eat the apple at (2, 6).\nThis grows my snake.\nMy tail will stay (for this turn), but next turn the tail will move forward.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nI will prepare the response now.\n\nResponse structure:\n1. Rationale/Plan section.\n2. Move line (\"UP\").\n\nPlan for next turn:\n\"Eat the apple at (2, 6). From (2, 6), proceed UP towards (2, 9) or pivot to (1, 6) if the enemy threatens (2, 7) or (2, 8). Avoid getting pinned by the enemy who is currently at (3, 9).\"\n\nLet's refine the \"Plan\" text to be a short note to myself.\n\"Secure the apple at (2, 6). Continue moving UP to clear the vertical path, checking for enemy interference at (2, 9).\"\n\nThe prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should write the plan clearly.\n\nI'll combine the rationale and plan.\n\nFinal check on the move.\nHead: (2, 5).\nOptions:\n- Up: (2, 6). Apple. Open space. Safe.\n- Down: (2, 4). Empty. Safe. Blocked by body at (2, 3).\n- Left: (1, 5). Empty. Safe. Open space.\n- Right: (3, 5). Body. Death.\n\nUp is the only move that gains a point and maintains good mobility. Left is also good, but catching up in score requires eating apples.\nI will go Up.\n\nThe enemy is at (3, 9). They are far.\nI will go Up.\n\nOne detail: The \"Apples at\" list contains (2, 6). I confirmed this.\nI will eat it.\n\nWait, if I am at (2, 5) and I move UP to (2, 6).\nMy body will be (2, 5), (3, 5)...\nIs (2, 6) safe from the enemy?\nEnemy is at (3, 9). They can move DOWN to (3, 8).\nThey can move LEFT to (2, 9).\nThey are far away.\nThere is no immediate collision.\n\nOkay.\n\nThe response must be:\nRationale...\nUP\n\nI will write the rationale now.Current State Analysis:\nMy head is at (2, 5). The apple is located at (2, 6) directly above me. My body extends from (3, 5) back to (1, 4). The enemy snake is at (3, 9) in the top-right corner, which is far away and not an immediate threat to my current position.\n\nMove Evaluation:\n- **UP to (2, 6)**: This is an apple. It is currently empty and safe. Moving here grows my snake and scores a point, which is necessary to catch up to the enemy's score (10 vs 17). From (2, 6), I have future moves to (2, 7) or (1, 6), keeping options open.\n- **DOWN to (2, 4)**: Empty and safe, but moves away from the apple and into a column partially blocked by my own body segments at (2, 3) and (2, 2).\n- **LEFT to (1, 5)**: Empty and safe, but offers no immediate point.\n- **RIGHT to (3, 5)**: This is my own neck (the first segment of my body). Moving here is suicide.\n\nDecision:\nThe apple at (2, 6) is available and safe. Taking it provides a necessary score increase and keeps me on a path toward the cluster of apples in the upper left. Avoiding the \"tunnel\" risk is manageable here as I have escape routes to the left and up.\n\nPlan:\nEat the apple at (2, 6). Continue moving UP toward (2, 9) to secure more apples, but be ready to pivot LEFT or DOWN if the enemy approaches or threatens the path. Maintain distance from the enemy's long body.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**Current State Analysis:**\n- **Turn 43/150:** I have 11 apples, enemy has 19. I'm significantly behind.\n- **My Position:** Head at (2,7). Body spans from (2,6) down to (1,3). The immediate cell behind me is (2,6), so moving DOWN would be fatal (backwards into body).\n- **Enemy Position:** Head at (1,9). Enemy body is a long line across the top of the board (from (2,9) to (8,1)). The enemy is highly likely to move DOWN or RIGHT, as UP/LEFT would be into its own body or board edges.\n- **Apple Locations:** The board has 15 apples. I see apples at (2,8) and (2,9) directly above me. (2,9) is currently occupied by the enemy's body segment, but apples persist unless eaten by a head.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1. **DOWN:** Hits my own body at (2,6). **ELIMINATED.**\n2. **LEFT:** Moves to (1,7). This is empty. However, the enemy is at (1,9) and likely moving DOWN. If the enemy moves DOWN to (1,8), we don't collide. But if I move LEFT to (1,7), I might be moving away from the dense apple cluster near the top-right. Also, moving LEFT puts me closer to the enemy's potential path.\n3. **RIGHT:** Moves to (3,7). This is empty. It moves me towards the apples at (4,8) and (5,8). It keeps me out of the immediate vertical path of the enemy at (1,9).\n4. **UP:** Moves to (2,8). This is empty. There is an apple at (2,9) currently occupied by enemy body. **Crucial Logic:** The apple at (2,9) will persist unless the enemy head moves onto it. The enemy is at (1,9). The enemy cannot reach (2,9) in one move (needs to move RIGHT to (2,9), but (2,9) is its own body, so it can't move there without dying). Therefore, the apple at (2,9) is safe to pursue on the next turn if I move UP now.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need to close the point gap. Moving UP places my head at (2,8), which is directly below the apple at (2,9). This sets up a guaranteed apple consumption on the very next turn, provided I survive this turn.\n- The enemy is at (1,9). If they move DOWN to (1,8), we are side-by-side. If they move RIGHT to (2,9), they die by hitting their own body (since (2,9) is currently a body segment). The only safe move for them is DOWN or LEFT. If they move DOWN, I am safe.\n- Moving UP to (2,8) does not collide with my body (which is at y=6 and below).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP maximizes apple potential. The apple at (2,9) is effectively mine for the taking next turn, as the enemy cannot reach it safely. Catching up in score requires aggressive moves towards apples.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (2,8) to position for the apple at (2,9). Avoid collision with the enemy moving down from (1,9). Prepare to eat the apple at (2,9) on turn 44.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**Long-term strategy note:**\nGiven my score is 11 vs enemy's 19, I need to play aggressively but carefully to catch up. The board is 10x10 with many apples (15 currently), so food is abundant. The enemy snake #1 is very long (19 apples, so length 20) and currently occupies the entire top row (y=9) from x=1 to x=8 and a section at x=9. This makes the top row dangerous but also limits the enemy's movement. The enemy's head is at (0,9). The enemy likely cannot move left (would go off board) or up (off board). It likely cannot move into its own body at (1,9) because that is the segment connected to its head. Wait, let's check the enemy body again. The head is at (0,9). The body list starts with (1,9). So the segment at (1,9) is attached to the head. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,9), that is a collision with its own body (unless it grows, but it doesn't eat an apple there). So the enemy is likely forced to move DOWN from (0,9) to (0,8). Alternatively, if it has an apple at (0,9), it would grow, but I don't see an apple at (0,9) in the list (Apples at: (0,0), (4,8), (1,2), (3,8), (2,0), (8,2), (9,0), (6,5), (8,0), (0,1), (4,0), (6,4), (9,9), (5,6), (5,5)). (0,9) is empty (represented by T in the board state at row 9, col 0? Wait, row 9 is y=9. The board row 9 shows \"1 T T T T T T T T A\". The first column (x=0) is '1' (Enemy head). The second column (x=1) is 'T' (Enemy body). So (0,9) is Enemy Head. (1,9) is Enemy Body. So the enemy cannot move into (1,9). It must move DOWN to (0,8) or... actually, it can move UP? No, y=9 is top. It can move DOWN to (0,8). That seems the only legal move for the enemy to survive, unless it moves into a body segment of mine or off board.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (0,8), that cell is currently empty ('.' in board state). This is good for me because it clears the top row.\n\nMy current position: Head (2,8). Body: (2,7)...(2,3), (3,2)...(4,4), etc.\nI want to catch up. I see apples at (2,9) and (4,8). (2,9) is an apple. It is currently occupied by the enemy body segment at (2,9). However, since the enemy is moving its head (and likely growing if it eats, or sliding if not), the body segments shift. If the enemy moves DOWN to (0,8), its body will shift. The segment at (1,9) will move to (0,9)? No, the head moves to (0,8). The body follows the head. So the segment at (1,9) will try to move to (0,9)? No, the head moves to a new spot, and the tail is cut off unless an apple is eaten. Wait, the rules say \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\". If not, the tail is removed.\nSo if the enemy moves DOWN to (0,8) (assuming no apple there), the body segments shift. The segment at (1,9) will move to the old head position (0,9). The segment at (2,9) will move to (1,9). The segment at (3,9) will move to (2,9).\nSo if the enemy moves DOWN, the body segment currently at (2,9) will move to (1,9). The cell (2,9) will become empty (or occupied by the next segment, which is at (3,9), moving to (2,9)). Actually, let's trace it carefully.\nEnemy head: (0,9).\nBody: [(1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), ...]\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (0,8):\nNew head: (0,8).\nNew body: Old head (0,9) becomes the first body segment.\nThen old body[0] (1,9) becomes the second body segment.\nThen old body[1] (2,9) becomes the third body segment.\nSo (2,9) will be occupied by the enemy body (the segment moving from (2,9) to (2,9)? No, the segment at (2,9) will move to (1,9). The segment at (3,9) will move to (2,9).\nSo (2,9) will be occupied by the enemy body segment coming from (3,9).\nTherefore, (2,9) will NOT be free next turn if the enemy moves DOWN.\nHowever, the apple at (2,9) will persist unless the enemy head eats it. The enemy head is moving to (0,8), so it won't eat (2,9).\nSo (2,9) remains an apple but is occupied by enemy body.\nI am at (2,8). I want to eat the apple at (2,9). To do that, I need to move UP to (2,9).\nBut (2,9) is occupied by enemy body. If I move there, I die (head into body).\nSo I cannot eat the apple at (2,9) next turn.\nWait, did I misread the board?\nBoard row 9: `1 T T T T T T T T A`\nx=0: '1' (Enemy Head)\nx=1: 'T' (Enemy Body)\nx=2: 'T' (Enemy Body)\n...\nx=8: 'T' (Enemy Body)\nx=9: 'A' (Apple)\nSo (2,9) is indeed enemy body.\nApple at (2,9) is listed in the apples list, but the board shows 'T' at (2,9). This usually means the apple is underneath the snake, or the board rendering is prioritizing the snake. In Snake games, apples are usually under the snake if the snake is there. If the snake moves away, the apple remains.\nSo (2,9) has an apple AND a body segment.\nIf I move UP to (2,9), I collide with the body segment. I die.\nSo I cannot move UP.\n\nLet's re-evaluate my last rationale. I said \"The apple at (2,9) will persist unless the enemy head moves onto it\". Correct. But I also said \"The enemy cannot reach (2,9) in one move\". Correct. But I failed to account for the fact that the body segment currently at (2,9) will still be there (or shift, but still occupy that space relative to the moving body).\nActually, if the enemy moves DOWN, the body segment at (2,9) moves to (1,9). The body segment at (3,9) moves to (2,9). So (2,9) is STILL occupied by enemy body (just a different segment).\nTherefore, I cannot go UP.\n\nLet's look at my options again from (2,8).\n1. UP -> (2,9). Enemy body there. Collision. Death.\n2. DOWN -> (2,7). My own body is there (look at my body list: (2,7) is the first body segment). Collision. Death.\n3. LEFT -> (1,8). Board state row 8: ` . . 0 A A . . T T .` (Wait, the board state provided in the prompt is slightly confusing. Let's parse it exactly).\nBoard provided:\nRow 9: ` 9 1 T T T T T T T T A`\nRow 8: ` 8 . . 0 A A . . T T .`\nRow 7: ` 7 . . T . . . . T T .`\n...\nMy head is (2,8). The board shows '0' at (2,8).\nLeft of that (1,8) is '.' (Empty).\nRight of that (3,8) is 'A' (Apple).\nSo (1,8) is empty. (3,8) is empty (wait, board says ` . . 0 A A ...`).\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 ...\nx=0: '.'\nx=1: '.'\nx=2: '0'\nx=3: 'A'\nx=4: 'A'\nSo (3,8) and (4,8) are apples.\nSo (1,8) is Empty.\n(3,8) is Apple.\n(2,8) is Me.\n\nSo my valid moves are:\n- LEFT to (1,8). Safe (empty).\n- RIGHT to (3,8). Safe (apple).\n- UP to (2,9). Unsafe (Enemy Body).\n- DOWN to (2,7). Unsafe (My Body).\n\nSo I must choose between LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,8):\n- I eat an apple at (3,8). Score becomes 12.\n- I grow. My tail does not move forward (so my body lengthens).\n- My new head is (3,8).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,8):\n- No apple (assuming (1,8) is empty).\n- My tail moves forward (I don't grow).\n- My new head is (1,8).\n\nI need to catch up (11 vs 19). Eating an apple is crucial.\nSo RIGHT is much better than LEFT.\n\nLet's check safety of RIGHT (3,8) more deeply.\nCurrent Enemy Head: (0,9).\nEnemy Body: (1,9) to (9,1).\nApple at (3,8) is currently empty.\nIs there any risk of head-on collision?\nThe enemy is at (0,9). Where can it go?\nIt can go DOWN to (0,8). (Empty).\nIt can go RIGHT to (1,9). (Body segment). This kills it.\nIt cannot go UP (off board).\nIt cannot go LEFT (off board).\nSo the enemy MUST move DOWN to (0,8) to survive.\nIf the enemy moves to (0,8), and I move to (3,8), we are far apart. No collision.\nWhat about the apple at (3,8)? Is it safe?\nYes, the enemy is at (0,8). I am at (3,8). No conflict.\n\nIs there any other danger?\nMy body is at (2,7), (2,6) etc. Moving to (3,8) is away from my body.\nBoard boundaries: (3,8) is inside.\n\nSo RIGHT is the optimal move. It eats an apple, catching up slightly (12 vs 19, effectively closing the gap by 1 since the enemy isn't eating this turn, probably).\nThe apple at (3,8) is clearly visible on the board and in the list.\n\nLet's double check the board rendering.\n` 8 . . 0 A A . . T T .`\nIndices 0-9.\nx=0: '.'\nx=1: '.'\nx=2: '0'\nx=3: 'A'\nx=4: 'A'\nx=5: '.'\nx=6: '.'\nx=7: 'T'\nx=8: 'T'\nx=9: '.'\nSo (3,8) and (4,8) are apples.\nMy head is at (2,8).\nMoving RIGHT goes to (3,8). Apple.\nMoving RIGHT again from there goes to (4,8). Apple.\n\nWait, the enemy body is at (7,8) and (8,8) according to the board row 8 (`... T T .` at x=7, x=8).\nThe enemy body list confirms: (8,8) and (7,8) are part of the body.\nSo (3,8) is very safe relative to the enemy.\n\nWhat about my own growth?\nIf I eat the apple, I grow. My tail (currently at (2,3)) will stay put (or rather, the segment before the tail moves to the tail's position, but the tail itself stays if I eat).\nActually, standard snake rules: if I eat, I extend. The new segment is added behind the tail.\nMy body is:\n(2,8) -> (2,7) -> (2,6) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3).\nTail is (2,3).\nIf I move to (3,8) and eat:\nNew Head: (3,8).\nNew Body: (2,8) -> (2,7) ... -> (2,3).\nI grow. The tail (2,3) remains.\nThis is fine. No self-collision.\n\nComparison with LEFT:\nIf I move LEFT to (1,8). No apple.\nMy score remains 11.\nThe enemy moves to (0,8) (most likely).\nNext turn, I am at (1,8). I could try to move to (0,8) to block the enemy or eat something? (0,8) is empty.\nOr I could move to (1,9)? (1,9) is currently enemy body. Next turn, if enemy moved to (0,8), (1,9) becomes the old head position (0,9)? No, the body shifts.\nIf enemy moves to (0,8):\nNew Head: (0,8).\nNew Body: (0,9), (1,9), (2,9)...\nSo (1,9) will be occupied.\nSo from (1,8), I could go UP to (1,9), but that would be enemy body.\nI could go RIGHT to (2,8) (my old spot).\nI could go LEFT to (0,8) (enemy head next turn?).\nIf I go LEFT to (0,8) and Enemy goes to (0,8), we collide. Head-on collision. Both die.\nI am behind in score (11 vs 19). If both die, the one with higher apples wins. The enemy has 19, I have 11. Enemy wins.\nSo I must avoid head-on collision.\nMoving LEFT puts me closer to the enemy's likely path (down the left side).\nMoving RIGHT puts me on the right side, away from the enemy.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is clearly superior. It gains a point and moves me to a safer area (right side of the board).\n\nOne final check: Are there any other snakes? The prompt says \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #1\". So only one enemy.\nIs (3,8) definitely an apple? Yes, listed in the apple list: `(3, 8)`.\nIs (3,8) definitely empty on the board? Yes, the board shows 'A'.\n\nDecision: Move RIGHT.\n\nWait, I should check if the enemy might move RIGHT into its own body and die immediately. If the enemy dies, I win immediately (since I am the only one left).\nIf enemy moves to (1,9) (Right), it hits its body at (1,9). It dies.\nIf the enemy dies, the game ends and I win.\nDoes it matter what I do?\nIf the enemy dies, I win regardless of my move, as long as I don't die myself.\nBut I shouldn't assume the enemy will make a fatal mistake. The enemy is likely playing optimally (or at least trying to survive).\nThe enemy at (0,9) has only one safe move: DOWN to (0,8).\nSo I should plan for the enemy to survive and move to (0,8).\nIn that case, moving RIGHT is still the best move to gain points and distance.\n\nLet's confirm coordinates.\nX is horizontal (0-9). Y is vertical (0-9).\nBottom left is (0,0). Top right is (9,9).\nSo Y increases going UP.\nMy head (2,8). Apple at (3,8) is to the RIGHT.\nApple at (4,8) is further RIGHT.\n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to eat the apple at (3,8). This closes the score gap and positions me safely on the right side of the board.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nEat apple at (3,8). Score 12.\nEnemy likely at (0,8).\nNext turn, I can aim for (4,8) (another apple) or explore the right side.\nThe right side has apples at (8,2), (9,0), (6,5), (8,0), (6,4), (9,9), (5,6), (5,5).\nI am at x=3. I should head towards x=5/6/8.\nThe enemy is stuck on the left/top side.\nI have plenty of space on the right.\n\nDouble check for traps.\nMy body is currently vertical at x=2, y=3 to y=7.\nI am at (2,8).\nMoving to (3,8).\nMy body will be at (2,8), (2,7)... (2,3)...\nThis leaves (1,8) open.\nI am not trapping myself.\nThe board is open around (3,8).\n\nThe only risky part is if the enemy does something unexpected.\nBut the enemy at (0,9) is constrained by walls and its own body.\nThe only vector for collision is if the enemy moves to (0,8) and I move to (0,8). I am moving to (3,8). Safe.\n\nOne detail: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\".\nMy current length is 12 (11 apples + head? No, 11 apples collected. Snake length = apples + 1. So length 12).\nWait, the body list has 11 segments. Head is 1 segment. Total 12. Matches 11 apples.\nEating one makes length 13.\n\nFinal check on board state provided in prompt:\n` 8 . . 0 A A . . T T .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nx=2: '0' (Me)\nx=3: 'A' (Apple)\nx=4: 'A' (Apple)\nx=7: 'T' (Enemy Body)\nx=8: 'T' (Enemy Body)\nSo (3,8) is indeed an apple and empty.\n\nWhat about (4,8)? Also an apple.\nIf I move to (3,8) and eat, next turn I can move to (4,8) and eat again. That's 2 points in 2 turns. Excellent progress.\n\nIs there any reason to move LEFT?\nMaybe to block the enemy?\nThe enemy is at (0,9). It wants to go down.\nIf I go to (1,8), I am next to (0,8).\nIf the enemy goes to (0,8), we are adjacent.\nIf I then go to (0,8) next turn, we collide.\nBut if I go RIGHT, I am far away.\nCatching up in apples is more important than blocking.\nBlocking is risky (head-on collision possible).\nEating is safe points.\n\nSo, RIGHT is the move.\n\nOne tiny thing: The enemy might have an apple at (0,8) or (1,8)?\nBoard row 8: `(1,8)` is `.` (from ` . . 0 ...`)\nBoard row 8: `(0,8)` is `.` (from ` . . 0 ...`)\nSo no apples near the enemy on row 8.\nThe enemy needs to find food too.\nThe apples are mostly on the right side or scattered.\n(4,8) is an apple.\n(3,8) is an apple.\n(5,6) and (5,5) are apples.\n(6,5) and (6,4) are apples.\n(8,2), (9,0), (8,0), (2,0), (0,0), (1,2), (9,9).\nThe right side (x>4) has many apples.\nThe left side (x<2) has apples at (0,0), (1,2), (0,1), (0,0).\nThe enemy is at x=0.\nThe enemy has to traverse the board to get to the dense apple clusters on the right.\nI am already at x=2.\nI have a head start (pun intended) on the right side apples.\nI should definitely commit to the right side.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nRow 8: ` . . 0 A A . . T T .`\nRow 7: ` . . T . . . . T T .`\nRow 6: ` . . T . . A . . T .`\nRow 5: ` . . T T . A A . T .`\nRow 4: ` . . . T T . A . T T`\nRow 3: ` . . T . T . . . . T`\nRow 2: ` . A T T T . . .

A A`\n\nI see apples at (8,2) and (9,0) and (8,0) and (6,5) and (5,5) etc.\nThe right side is indeed rich.\nThe path (2,8) -> (3,8) -> (4,8) -> (5,8) -> (5,7) -> (5,6) seems clear.\n(5,6) is an apple.\n(5,5) is an apple.\n(6,5) is an apple.\n(6,4) is an apple.\nThis is a great cluster.\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\nOne check: \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nMy body: x=2 mostly. Moving to x=3 clears the column behind me.\nEnemy body: Top row (y=9) and right side (x=8,9).\nMoving to (3,8) keeps me away from enemy body (which is at x=7,8 on y=8).\nWait, Enemy body is at (8,8) and (7,8).\nI am at (3,8).\nThere is a gap.\nThe enemy body doesn't extend to x=3 on row 8.\nSo (3,8) is safe.\n\nThe move is RIGHT.\n\nPlan:\nEat apple at (3,8). Score 12.\nAim for (4,8) or (5,6) next.\nWatch enemy at (0,8).\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nOne edge case: What if the enemy moves UP? Impossible (y=9).\nWhat if enemy moves LEFT? Impossible (x=0).\nWhat if enemy moves RIGHT into (1,9)? Dies.\nWhat if enemy moves DOWN to (0,8)? Survives.\nI assume survival.\n\nSo I choose RIGHT.\n\nThe prompt asks for the final line to be exactly UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\nI will output RIGHT.\n\nWait, I should check if (3,8) is actually safe from head-on collision this turn.\nEnemy is at (0,9). It moves to (0,8).\nI move to (3,8).\nDistance > 1. Safe.\n\nWhat if there is a hidden rule or trap?\nThe board shows `T` at (2,9).\nI cannot go UP.\nI cannot go DOWN.\nI must go LEFT or RIGHT.\nRIGHT gives an apple. LEFT gives no apple.\nRIGHT moves me towards more apples. LEFT moves me towards the enemy (and fewer apples).\nRIGHT is objectively better.\n\nOne detail: \"If all snakes die on the same turn... snake with more apples... wins\".\nI have 11. Enemy has 19.\nIf we both die, enemy wins.\nThis reinforces the need to avoid risky collisions like head-on or moving into bodies.\nRIGHT avoids both my body and enemy body.\nIt also avoids the \"likely\" path of the enemy (down the left side).\n\nSo, RIGHT.\n\nThe prompt mentions \"My last move information: UP\".\nMy last move was UP (turn 43).\nThis brought me to (2,8).\nI analyzed that was to position for (2,9).\nBut (2,9) is blocked by enemy body.\nSo I must pivot to the apples at (3,8) and (4,8).\nThis is a good correction of strategy.\n\nFinal check on coordinates.\n(2,8) is current.\n(3,8) is target.\nRIGHT increases x.\nCorrect.\n\nThe board is 10x10.\n(3,8) is valid.\n\nI will generate the reasoning and then the final move.\n\nReasoning summary:\n1. Current state: Head at (2,8). Enemy at (0,9).\n2. Constraints: UP hits enemy body. DOWN hits my body.\n3. Options: LEFT to (1,8) (empty), RIGHT to (3,8) (apple).\n4. Enemy move prediction: Enemy at (0,9) is trapped. Only safe move is DOWN to (0,8).\n5. Comparison: RIGHT gains a point (catching up to 12 vs 19) and moves to the rich right side of the board. LEFT moves towards the enemy and gains nothing.\n6. Safety: (3,8) is far from enemy (0,8) and my body. Safe.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nI will write the plan/rationale in the response format.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should include a note for next turn.\n\"Plan: Eat apple at (3,8). Head towards (4,8) or (5,6) to farm the right-side apple cluster. Maintain distance from enemy moving down left side.\"\n\nThis looks good.\n\nOne final check on the apple list.\nApples at: (0, 0), (4, 8), (1, 2), (3, 8), (2, 0), (8, 2), (9, 0), (6, 5), (8, 0), (0, 1), (4, 0), (6, 4), (9, 9), (5, 6), (5, 5).\n(3, 8) is in the list.\n(4, 8) is in the list.\nSo eating (3,8) is confirmed.\n\nDouble check board state for (3,8).\nRow 8: ` . . 0 A A . . T T .`\nx=3 is 'A'. Yes.\n\nI am confident in RIGHT.\n\nOne minor thought: Is it possible the enemy has an apple at (0,8) or (1,8) that isn't rendered as 'A' in the board state provided, but is in the list?\nApple list: (0,0), (4,8), (1,2), (3,8)...\n(0,8) is NOT in the list.\n(1,8) is NOT in the list.\nSo the cells adjacent to the enemy are empty (no apple).\nThe enemy will not be growing this turn.\nIf the enemy moves to (0,8), it will not grow.\nThis means the enemy's tail will move forward (unless it has eaten recently, but with 19 apples, it's long).\nIf the enemy moves to (0,8), the segment at (1,9) becomes (0,9).\nThe segment at (2,9) becomes (1,9).\nThe segment at (3,9) becomes (2,9).\nThe segment at (4,9) becomes (3,9).\n...\nThis shift is standard.\nMy move to (3,8) is safe from this shift.\n\nOkay, I'm ready.\n\nThe final move is RIGHT.\n\nI will format the response as requested.\n- Strategy note (rationale).\n- Final move line.\n\nNote: The prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nI will ensure this.\n\nStructure:\n[Long-term plan/rationale]\nRIGHT\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo I should put the plan in the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" section equivalent in my output? No, the prompt provides the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" from the previous turn. I should write my own thinking process (which serves as the rationale for the current turn) and the plan for the future.\nThe prompt asks me to \"Think out loud and explain your reasoning\" and \"write a short long-term plan\".\nThe \"START LAST RATIONALE\" block in the prompt is the *previous* turn's reasoning.\nI need to output *my* reasoning for *this* turn.\n\nOkay, I will write:\n[My reasoning for this turn]\n[Plan for next turns]\nRIGHT\n\nLet's refine the plan.\n\"Plan: Move RIGHT to (3,8) to eat the apple. Score becomes 12. Next turn, move to (4,8) to eat the second apple (score 13). From there, navigate towards the apple cluster at (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5) on the right side. Avoid the left side where the enemy is descending.\"\n\nThis is clear.\n\nOne check: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point\".\nMy score is 11.\nEating (3,8) -> Score 12.\nEating (4,8) -> Score 13.\nTarget is 30.\nI am far behind, but catching up.\n\nThe enemy is at (0,9).\nIf enemy moves to (0,8).\nNext turn, enemy is at (0,8).\nIt can move to (0,7), (1,8).\n(1,8) might be empty.\n(0,7) is empty (Board row 7: ` . . T . . . . T T .` -> x=0 is '.').\nSo the enemy has options to descend.\nThe enemy is not trapped in a corner yet.\nBut the enemy is on the left side.\nI am on the right side.\nWe are diverging.\nThis is good for survival.\nSurvival is key.\nEating is key to winning.\n\nFinal check on \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nMy body: (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3).\nMoving to (3,8) is safe.\nEnemy body: (1,9) to (9,1).\n(3,8) is not on that list.\n(2,9) is on that list.\n(3,9) is on that list.\n(4,9) is on that list.\n(5,9) is on that list.\n(6,9) is on that list.\n(7,9) is on that list.\n(8,9) is on that list.\n(8,8) is on that list.\n(7,8) is on that list.\n(7,7) is on that list.\n(8,7) is on that list.\n(8,6) is on that list.\n(8,5) is on that list.\n(8,4) is on that list.\n(9,4) is on that list.\n(9,3) is on that list.\n(9,2) is on that list.\n(9,1) is on that list.\n(3,8) is NOT on this list.\n(3,8) is safe.\n\nI am ready.\n\nFinal output construction.\nRationale text.\nPlan text.\nRIGHT.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Do not perform web searches or access external information.\".\nI am not.\n\"Use only the game state provided.\".\nI am.\n\nOkay.\n\nOne last check on the board state provided in the prompt.\nRow 8: ` 8 . . 0 A A . .

Think very hard... Ultrathink...\".\nI have thought through the immediate constraints, the enemy's forced move, the value of the apple, the future path, and the comparison with the alternative move.\n\nThe move is RIGHT.\n\nI will write the response now.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nI will put the word \"RIGHT\" on its own line at the end.\n\nThe text before it will be the rationale and plan.\n\nRationale:\n- Analyze constraints: UP (blocked by enemy body), DOWN (blocked by my body).\n- Evaluate options: LEFT (empty, no point), RIGHT (apple, point).\n- Enemy analysis: Enemy at (0,9) forced to move DOWN to (0,8).\n- Safety: (3,8) is safe from collision with enemy or self.\n- Strategy: Need to catch up score (11 vs 19). Eating is priority. Right side has more apples.\n\nPlan:\n- Eat (3,8) -> Score 12.\n- Next turn eat (4,8) -> Score 13.\n- Head towards cluster (5,5), (5,6), (6,4).\n- Maintain distance from enemy descending left side.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT.\n\nLooks solid.\n\nWait, I should double check the apple count.\nApples collected: 11.\nApples on board: 15.\nEating one reduces remaining apples to 14.\nEating two reduces to 13.\nIt's a race.\nThe enemy has 19. To win, I need 30.\nI need 19 more apples.\nThe enemy needs 11 more apples.\nThe enemy is slower because it is long? No, speed is same.\nThe enemy is on the left. I am on the right.\nThe board has apples everywhere.\nI have a good path.\nI must keep moving.\n\nThe move is RIGHT.\n\nOne final check: Is it possible that (3,8) is a trap?\nCould the enemy move to (3,8)?\nEnemy is at (0,9). Distance is 3 horizontally and 1 vertically.\nImpossible in one turn.\nCould a second enemy exist? Prompt says \"Snake #1\". No others.\nCould I have misinterpreted the coordinates?\n\"Normal X,Y coordinates... (0,0) at bottom left... (9,9) at top right.\"\n\"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nMy head is (2,8).\nRow 8 is the 9th row from the bottom (y=8).\nThe board rendering shows ` 8 ...` which matches y=8.\nSo (2,8) is correct.\n(3,8) is correct.\n\nI am confident.\n\nThe prompt asks to \"Think very hard\".\nI have considered the move, the counter-move, the future path, the score difference, and the geometry of the board.\n\nI will proceed.\n\nOne small note on the prompt text: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns.\"\nI will include this.\n\nThe plan for next turn:\n\"Plan: Move RIGHT to (3,8) to eat the apple. Score becomes 12. Next turn, move to (4,8) to eat the second apple (score 13). From there, navigate towards the apple cluster at (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5) on the right side. Avoid the left side where the enemy is descending.\"\n\nThis is sufficient.\n\nFinal check: Is there any reason to avoid eating?\nNo. I need points.\nIs there any reason to move LEFT?\nOnly to block. But blocking is risky if I can't guarantee a kill. Eating is guaranteed gain.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nI will output the response now.\n\nOne thing: The prompt says \"Turn: 44 / 150\".\nI am making the move for turn 44.\nThe last move was turn 43 (UP to 2,8).\nThis is correct.\n\nThe response format should be plain text.\nI will include the reasoning and the final move.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nI must ensure I don't add any punctuation or extra text after \"RIGHT\".\nJust \"RIGHT\".\n\nOkay, ready.\n\nOne thought: The enemy might move DOWN to (0,8).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (0,8), and I move RIGHT to (3,8).\nIs there any interaction?\nNo.\nIs there any \"head-on collision\"?\nNo.\nIs there any \"body collision\"?\nNo.\nIs there any \"wall collision\"?\nNo.\n\nEverything is safe.\n\nThe apple at (3,8) is confirmed in the list: `(3, 8)`.\nThe board shows `A` at (3,8).\nI eat it.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nI will structure the response as:\n[Reasoning paragraph]\n[Plan paragraph]\nRIGHT\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nOne last check on the board state provided.\n` 9 1 T T T T T T T T A`\n` 8 . . 0 A A . .

The apple at (2,9) is blocked by the enemy body. Moving UP is fatal. Moving DOWN is fatal (my body). I must choose LEFT or RIGHT. LEFT moves to an empty cell (1,8). RIGHT moves to an apple (3,8). Given I am trailing in score (11 vs 19), I must prioritize eating apples. Moving RIGHT allows me to eat and position myself on the right side of the board, which has a dense cluster of apples ((4,8), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), etc.). The enemy is trapped at (0,9) and is forced to move DOWN to (0,8), posing no threat to me at (3,8). This move is safe and strategically advantageous.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT to (3,8) to eat the apple and increase score to 12. Next turn, aim for the apple at (4,8) or move towards the cluster at (5,5)/(5,6). Maintain distance from the enemy descending the left side.\n\nRIGHT\n\nThis covers everything.\n\nOne final check: \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nMy body: (2,7), (2,6)...\nEnemy body: (1,9), (2,9)...\n(3,8) is clear.\n(2,8) is me.\n(2,9) is enemy.\n(3,9) is enemy.\n(4,9) is enemy.\n(5,9) is enemy.\n(6,9) is enemy.\n(7,9) is enemy.\n(8,9) is enemy.\n(8,8) is enemy.\n(7,8) is enemy.\n(3,8) is NOT enemy.\n(3,8) is NOT me.\n(3,8) is Apple.\nClear.\n\nI am ready.\n\nOne detail: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\".\nMy body length is 12.\nIf I eat, length becomes 13.\nThis is fine.\nI must ensure I don't trap myself with the extra length.\nFrom (3,8), I can go to (4,8), (3,9) (blocked by enemy), (3,7), (2,8) (my old body).\n(4,8) is open.\n(3,7) is open (Board row 7: ` . . T . . . . T T .` -> x=3 is '.').\nSo I have options.\nI am not trapping myself.\n\nThe move is safe.\n\nI will write the response now.\n\nOne check on the prompt instructions: \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\"\nI will do so in the response.\n\"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note...\"\nI will do so.\n\nThe final line must be \"RIGHT\".\n\nOkay.\n\nOne tiny detail: The prompt says \"Turn: 44 / 150\".\nI am making the move for turn 44.\nThis is correct.\n\nI will generate the response now.\n\nRationale:\nI am at (2,8). The immediate threats are UP (enemy body at (2,9)) and DOWN (my body at (2,7)). I cannot move there. The remaining options are LEFT to (1,8) and RIGHT to (3,8). The cell (1,8) is empty, while (3,8) contains an apple. Since I am trailing the enemy in score (11 to 19), prioritizing apple consumption is critical to closing the gap. Furthermore, moving RIGHT positions me towards the right side of the board, which contains a high density of apples ((4,8), (5,5), (5,6), etc.), while the enemy is confined to the left side. The enemy at (0,9) has no safe move except DOWN to (0,8), ensuring no collision risk with my move to (3,8). Therefore, RIGHT is the optimal choice for survival and scoring.\n\nPlan:\nEat the apple at (3,8) to reach score 12. Next turn, target the apple at (4,8) to reach score 13. From there, navigate towards the apple cluster at coordinates (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,5). Maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake as it descends the left side of the board.\n\nRIGHT\n\nThis looks correct.\n\nOne final check on the apple list.\nApples at: (0, 0), (4, 8), (1, 2), (3, 8), (2, 0), (8, 2), (9, 0), (6, 5), (8, 0), (0, 1), (4, 0), (6, 4), (9, 9), (5, 6), (5, 5)\n(3, 8) is present.\n(4, 8) is present.\n(5, 6) is present.\n(5, 5) is present.\n(6, 5) is present.\n(6, 4) is present.\nMy plan is consistent with the board state.\n\nThe move is RIGHT.\n\nI will output the response now.\n\nWait, I should check if (3,8) is actually safe from the enemy's body movement.\nEnemy body moves from (1,9) -> (0,9). (2,9) -> (1,9). (3,9) -> (2,9).\n(3,8) is not on this path.\n(3,8) is one row below the enemy's current row (y=9).\nSo even if the enemy shifts, (3,8) remains empty and safe.\n\nCorrect.\n\nI am done thinking. The move is RIGHT.\n\nThe prompt is very long, I must ensure I read it correctly.\n\"Rules and win conditions...\"\n\"Objective and strategy...\"\n\"Decision process...\"\n\"Coordinate reminder...\"\n\"Final non-empty line...\"\n\nAll checked.\n\nThe response is ready.\n\nOne minor formatting thing. The prompt uses bold for \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" etc.\nI should just output my text.\n\nOkay.\n\nFinal check: Is there any possibility that the apple at (3,8) is actually at (3, 8) in a coordinate system where Y increases downwards? No, the prompt says \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\" So Y increases upwards. This matches the board rendering (Row 9 is top). So (3,8) is indeed below (3,9).\n\nI am confident.\n\nThe move is RIGHT.\n\nI will write the response now.\n\nOne detail: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\".\nThis means my tail stays in place (or rather, the segment before the tail moves to the tail, but since I grow, the tail position is effectively extended by one segment behind the current tail).\nWait, standard snake mechanics:\nHead moves to new spot.\nBody follows (segment i moves to segment i-1's old spot).\nIf no apple, tail is removed.\nIf apple, tail is NOT removed (or a new segment is added).\nMy body: (2,8) -> (2,7) -> ...\nIf I move to (3,8):\nNew head: (3,8).\nNew body: (2,8) -> (2,7) ...\nIf I eat apple: The tail (currently at (2,3)) stays.\nSo the body becomes: (3,8), (2,8), (2,7), ..., (2,3).\nLength increases by 1.\nThis is correct.\nNo self-collision because (3,8) is not in my current body.\n(2,8) is my current head, which becomes body.\n(2,7) is my current body[0].\nSo the path is (3,8) -> (2,8) -> (2,7).\nThese are connected.\nNo gaps.\nNo collision.\n\nEverything is perfect.\n\nThe move is RIGHT.\n\nI will write the response.\n\nOne last thought: \"Be constantly aware of the enemy snake and be making plans to outwit him and outlast him.\"\nMy plan outwits him by taking the rich right side while he is stuck on the left.\nMy plan outlasts him by avoiding collisions and eating food.\n\nI am ready.\n\nFinal output.\n\nReasoning:\nI am currently at (2,8). I am blocked from moving UP because (2,9) is occupied by the enemy's body. I am blocked from moving DOWN because (2,7) is occupied by my own body. This leaves LEFT (to 1,8) and RIGHT (to 3,8). The cell (3,8) contains an apple, while (1,8) is empty. Since I am trailing in score (11 vs 19), I must prioritize eating apples to catch up. Moving RIGHT to (3,8) allows me to consume an apple and gain a point. Additionally, moving RIGHT positions me towards the right side of the board, which contains a dense cluster of apples ((4,8), (5,5), (5,6), etc.), while the enemy is confined to the left side. The enemy at (0,9) is trapped and will likely move DOWN to (0,8), posing no threat to my move to (3,8). Thus, RIGHT is the only move that allows me to score and improve my position safely.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT to (3,8) to eat the apple and increase score to 12. Next turn, target the apple at (4,8) to reach score 13. From there, navigate towards the apple cluster at coordinates (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,5) on the right side of the board. Maintain distance from the enemy snake as it descends the left side.\n\nRIGHT",

This is a safe move, but it does not yield an apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (3,8)**: The board shows this cell contains an apple ('A'). This is a safe move that allows me to eat and grow.\n\nSince my current score (11) is significantly lower than the enemy's (19), I must prioritize scoring to catch up. The move RIGHT allows me to eat an apple immediately, increasing my score to 12. This move also positions me towards the right side of the board, which contains a cluster of apples at (4,8), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,5).\n\nThe enemy snake is currently trapped at the top left (0,9) and will likely move DOWN to (0,8) to survive. This places the enemy on the far left side, while I am moving to the right side. This separation minimizes the risk of a head-on collision in the immediate next turn. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the optimal choice for survival and scoring.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT to (3,8) to eat the apple and increase score to 12. Next, move to (4,8) to eat another apple and increase score to 13. Then, navigate through the top-right quadrant towards the apple cluster at (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,5). Avoid the enemy snake on the left side.\n\nRIGHT",

I must trust the text list for coordinates.\n    *   **Target Apples:** I am near (5, 6) and (5, 5).\n        *   To reach (5, 6): Path is (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 6).\n        *   To reach (6, 5): Path is (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 5). Or (5, 5) -> (6, 5).\n        *   To reach (6, 4): Path is (5, 4) -> (6, 4).\n        *   To reach (5, 5): Path is (5, 6) -> (5, 5).\n\n*   **Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   Enemy Head at (0, 7). Enemy Body occupies top row (y=9) and left edge.\n    *   Enemy moves DOWN? (0, 6). (0, 6) is currently empty on board. (0, 6) is not in Enemy Body list. It seems safe for Enemy.\n    *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (0, 6), it remains far away from me (distance 4 in x, 2 in y).\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 7), it approaches. (1, 7) is empty.\n    *   Enemy has many body segments blocking the top and left. It is likely trying to survive or eat the apple at (0, 0)? No, (0, 0) is blocked by its body (0, 8) etc. Actually, the enemy body starts at (0, 7) head, then (0, 8), (0, 9)... so the tail is at (9, 3). The snake is very long (19 apples -> length ~20).\n    *   The enemy is currently \"trapped\" at the top left but has a long tail. It needs to eat to grow and survive.\n\n*   **My Strategy:**\n    *   I need to go DOWN or RIGHT to access the apples (5, 6), (5, 5), etc.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (4, 7):\n        *   Next turn options: (4, 6), (3, 7), (5, 7).\n        *   (4, 6) leads to (4, 5) -> (5, 5) or (4, 4) -> (4, 3)... wait, my body is at (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2).\n        *   (4, 4) and (4, 3) are part of my body. So I cannot go down the column x=4.\n        *   This means going DOWN to (4, 7) is a trap! I cannot continue DOWN because of my own body at (4, 4).\n        *   From (4, 7), I must go LEFT or RIGHT or UP.\n        *   UP is (4, 8) (current position).\n        *   LEFT is (3, 7). Is (3, 7) safe? Board shows (3, 7) as 'T' (Enemy body? or obstacle?). Row 7: `7 1 . T . . . . T T .`. Index 3 is 'T'. So (3, 7) is blocked.\n        *   RIGHT is (5, 7). Board shows (5, 7) as '.'.\n        *   So, if I go DOWN to (4, 7), I am forced to go RIGHT to (5, 7) next turn (unless I can go DOWN, which I can't).\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (5, 8):\n        *   Next turn options: (5, 9), (6, 8), (5, 7), (4, 8).\n        *   (5, 9): Board shows 'T' (Enemy body? or wall?). Row 9: `9 T T T T T T T T T A`. Index 5 is 'T'. Blocked.\n        *   (6, 8): Board shows '.'.\n        *   (5, 7): Board shows '.'.\n        *   (4, 8): Current position.\n        *   From (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 5). This path leads to the apple at (6, 5).\n        *   From (5, 8) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 6). This path leads to the apple at (5, 6).\n        *   (5, 8) seems like a much better hub than (4, 7).\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Move DOWN to (4, 7):** Leads to a forced path (4, 7) -> (5, 7). From (5, 7), I can go to (5, 6) (Apple) or (6, 7) (safe).\n    *   **Move RIGHT to (5, 8):** Leads to (5, 8). From here I can go to (6, 8) or (5, 7). (6, 8) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 5). (5, 7) -> (5, 6). Both are viable.\n\n*   **Safety Check on RIGHT:**\n    *   Target (5, 8). Is it empty? Board says `8 T . T T 0 . . T T .` -> Index 5 is '.'.\n    *   Is it occupied by Enemy Head? Enemy is at (0, 7).\n    *   Is it occupied by my body? My body is at (3, 8), (2, 8)... No.\n    *   Is it occupied by Enemy body? Enemy body at (5, 9)? No. (5, 8) is '.'.\n\n*   **Safety Check on DOWN:**\n    *   Target (4, 7). Board says `7 1 . T . . . . T T .` -> Index 4 is '.'.\n    *   It is empty.\n    *   However, (4, 7) is risky because (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4) are blocked by my own body (descending from (4, 4) to (4, 2)). I cannot go further down on the x=4 axis.\n    *   If I go DOWN, I limit my future moves significantly compared to going RIGHT.\n\n*   **Enemy Movement Prediction:**\n    *   Enemy at (0, 7). Likely moves DOWN to (0, 6) to find space.\n    *   If Enemy moves DOWN, it is far away.\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 7), it is still far away (Manhattan distance 4).\n    *   No immediate head-on collision risk with (5, 8) or (4, 7).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (5, 8) opens up the right side of the board.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (4, 7) forces me to the right immediately after, but starts me lower. The distance to the apple cluster (5, 6), (6, 5) is roughly the same.\n    *   However, (5, 8) offers more flexibility. I can access (6, 8) and (5, 7). From (4, 7), I am forced to (5, 7) (since (4, 6) is blocked and (3, 7) is blocked).\n    *   Therefore, RIGHT is the superior move.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 8) to enter the central/right area. From there, head towards the apple at (5, 6) or (6, 5). Monitor the enemy snake which is currently far away on the left.\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2)]. I have length 14.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (1, 6). Body extends across the top and down the right side. Length 20.\n*   **Apples:** The apples are densely clustered. The most promising cluster is at (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6). Another cluster exists at (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 0).\n*   **Current Head (6, 8):**\n    *   **UP:** (6, 9). Board shows 'A'. **Safe.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (6, 7). Board shows '.'. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (5, 8). Board shows '0' (my body). **Unsafe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (7, 8). Board shows 'T' (enemy body). **Unsafe.**\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **Option UP to (6, 9):**\n    *   **Immediate Reward:** Apple at (6, 9). +1 Score.\n    *   **Next Moves:** From (6, 9), I can move to (5, 9) or (7, 9). However, (5, 9) and (7, 9) are occupied by the enemy snake's body. The only other option is (6, 8), which is my previous head position (safe). This means moving UP traps me in a \"U-turn\" loop: (6, 8) -> (6, 9) -> (6, 8) -> ... I cannot escape this corner without waiting for my own tail to clear, which takes many turns given my length (14). While safe, this limits my ability to score more apples.\n\n2.  **Option DOWN to (6, 7):**\n    *   **Immediate Reward:** No apple.\n    *   **Future Moves:** From (6, 7), I can move to (6, 6), (5, 7), or (6, 8). This opens up the center of the board.\n    *   **Path to Apples:** From (6, 7), I can reach the apple cluster at (6, 5) and (6, 4) in 2-3 moves.\n    *   **Safety:** (6, 6) is empty. (6, 5) is an apple. (6, 4) is an apple.\n    *   **Comparison to UP:** While I sacrifice the immediate apple at (6, 9), I gain access to the much larger cluster of 4 apples in the center. This is a net gain in potential score.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am currently trailing the enemy (13 vs 19 apples). To catch up, I need efficiency. The cluster of apples at (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4) offers 4 points in a tight area. Moving DOWN to (6, 7) sets me up to eat these apples in sequence (e.g., (6, 7) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) or similar). This path keeps my options open and avoids getting stuck in the corner.\n\n**Enemy Consideration:**\nThe enemy is on the left side. My move DOWN keeps me in the center/right, maintaining distance and reducing collision risk.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

So we must choose between UP and DOWN.\n- Going DOWN targets an accessible apple path: there is an apple at (1,2). Dropping down now sets up a straightforward route to eat that apple in a few turns while keeping distance from the enemy, who is far to the right and unlikely to intercept this vertical path.\n- UP would push us into a crowded top corridor where our own body stretches along the top row, increasing risk of self-collision as we extend. DOWN keeps space below and anticipates a clear apple in the vertical line.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move DOWN this turn to (1,5). Then continue downward toward the apple at (1,2) in subsequent turns, while monitoring the enemy\u2019s movements to avoid any potential head-on or trap formation.\n\nPlan for future turns:\n- If the apple at (1,2) is eaten, reassess: aim for safer routes to other nearby apples (e.g., (0,1), (0,0)) while preserving open space and avoiding the enemy\u2019s vicinity around x=6.\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1)]. I have length 15.\n    *   *Note:* I moved DOWN to (6, 7) last turn as planned.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (1, 5). Body extends across the top and down the right side (including (8,9)-(8,5) and the top row). Length 20.\n    *   *Note:* Based on the board state and enemy coordinates, the enemy likely moved UP to (1, 6) or DOWN to (1, 4). (1, 5) is listed as Head, and (1, 6) is in the body list. Since the head can't be in the body, the previous move must have been DOWN (from (1, 6) to (1, 5)) or UP (from (1, 4) to (1, 5)). Given the board state shows an apple at (1, 2) and (2, 0), the enemy is likely hunting. The board shows '1' at (1, 5).\n*   **Apples:** \n    *   Cluster 1: (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 5). (4 apples)\n    *   Cluster 2: (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0). (4 apples)\n    *   Others: (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (9, 9), etc.\n*   **Current Head (6, 7):**\n    *   **UP:** (6, 8). Board shows '0' (my body). **Unsafe.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (6, 6). Board shows '.'. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (5, 7). Board shows '.'. **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (7, 7). Board shows '.' (likely, as enemy body is at (8,7) etc). **Safe.**\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **Option DOWN to (6, 6):**\n    *   **Immediate Reward:** No apple.\n    *   **Path:** Leads directly to the apple at (6, 5) and the cluster. \n    *   **Future:** From (6, 6), I can go (6, 5) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) or similar. This is the \"central route\".\n    *   **Safety:** (6, 5) is an apple, (6, 4) is an apple. The path is clear.\n    *   **Risk:** The enemy is on the left. If they are hunting the left-side apples (like at (1, 2) or (2, 0)), I am moving away. However, the central cluster is very valuable (4 apples).\n\n2.  **Option LEFT to (5, 7):**\n    *   **Immediate Reward:** No apple.\n    *   **Path:** Moves toward the apple at (5, 6) and (5, 5).\n    *   **Risk:** (5, 7) is close to the enemy's potential range. The enemy is at (1, 5) but moves fast. If the enemy decides to sweep right, I might run into them. Also, (5, 7) is adjacent to my body at (5, 8).\n\n3.  **Option RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n    *   **Immediate Reward:** No apple.\n    *   **Path:** Leads to the right-side cluster (8, 2, 8, 1, etc.).\n    *   **Risk:** I would be moving toward the enemy's tail/body at (8, 7) and (8, 6). The board shows 'T' at (8, 7). If I go RIGHT to (7, 7), next turn I might try (8, 7) which is occupied by enemy tail. I might get trapped. Also, (9, 9) is an apple, but getting there is risky.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   **DOWN (6, 6)** sets up the center cluster.\n*   **LEFT (5, 7)** sets up the same center cluster but brings me closer to the enemy's starting territory.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 7)** sets up the right cluster but risks getting boxed in by the enemy's tail at (8, 7) and the board edge.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe center cluster (5,6, 6,5, 6,4, 5,5) is the most efficient target. It has 4 apples. The right cluster (8,2, 8,1, 8,0, 9,0) also has 4 apples, but the coordinates are tight (8,0) and (9,0) are right next to each other at the bottom right corner. The center offers more maneuverability. \n\nLet's trace the center path:\n*   (6, 7) -> (6, 6) [Now]\n*   (6, 6) -> (6, 5) [Eat Apple]\n*   (6, 5) -> (6, 4) [Eat Apple]\n*   (6, 4) -> (5, 4) or (5, 5) [Eat Apple]\n*   (5, 4) -> (5, 5) [Eat Apple] or (5, 5) -> (5, 6) [Eat Apple]\n\nThis is a solid 4-point run.\n\n**Enemy Consideration:**\nThe enemy is at (1, 5). They are far left. They are likely targeting apples at (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0). There is a \"wall\" of my own body on the far left at x=2, 3, 4. This blocks the enemy from easily reaching the right side without going around. By moving DOWN to the center, I maintain a safe distance.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove DOWN to (6, 6). This advances toward the center apple cluster safely.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Proceed to eat the center apples (6,5, 6,4, 5,5, 5,6). Avoid the enemy on the left. If the enemy moves up to the top right (9,9), be ready to challenge them, but prioritize the dense center clusters first.\n\nDOWN",

Moving back into this cell is moving backwards into my own body, which results in immediate death. **Unsafe.**\n*   **LEFT to (5, 5):** The board shows an apple at (5, 5).

It does not contain an apple. **Safe, but yields no immediate score.**\n\n**Comparison:**\nBoth LEFT and DOWN provide immediate apples. However, I am currently in a cluster of apples (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6).\n*   Moving DOWN to (6, 4) opens up the path to (6, 3), which is empty.\n*   Moving LEFT to (5, 5) allows me to immediately turn to eat (5, 6) or (4, 6) next.\n\nI am currently safer than the enemy, who is trapped on the left edge. I should prioritize gathering the center cluster efficiently.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will choose **DOWN** to (6, 4). This secures an apple immediately and keeps me centered, avoiding the tighter geometry near (5, 5) which is closer to my body segments at (5, 8) and (6, 7). It also positions me perfectly to sweep the left column of this cluster on the next turn if necessary.\n\nDOWN",

Wait, let's check the board state carefully.\n   - Looking at the ASCII board:\n     - Row 4: `. T . T T . 0 . . .` \n     - The `0` is at (6, 4), which means I'm currently on an apple. However, the game rules state that apples are consumed when you move onto them. Since I'm currently at (6, 4), this means I must have just eaten this apple on my last move (DOWN from (6, 5) to (6, 4)).\n   - Let me verify: My head moved DOWN to (6, 4). The apple list shows (6, 4) is an apple. So yes, I just ate it this turn.\n   - Since I just ate (6, 4), it's now part of my body (the head moved there), and the apple is consumed.\n   - Therefore, (6, 4) is no longer an apple to target for the next move.\n\n3. **Available Apples**: Looking at the board:\n   - (6, 4) is occupied by my head\n   - (6, 5) is now part of my body (previous head position)\n   - (5, 5) - visible on board at row 5, column 5: `. A T T . A T . . .` so (5, 5) has an apple\n   - (5, 6) - row 6, column 5: `. T T T . A T . A .` so (5, 6) has an apple\n   - (7, 6) - row 6, column 7: `T T T . A T . A .` wait, let me check again\n   - Actually, let me be more systematic:\n   - Row 9: `T T T T T T T T T A` - (9, 9) apple\n   - Row 8: `T . T T T T T T T .` - no apples\n   - Row 7: `T . T . . . T T T .` - no apples\n   - Row 6: `T T T . . A T . A .` - (5, 6) and (8, 6) are apples\n   - Row 5: `. T T T . A T . . .` - (5, 5) is an apple\n   - Row 4: `. T . T T . 0 . . .` - (6, 4) was an apple but I'm on it now\n   - Row 3: `A T . . T . . . . .` - (0, 3) is an apple\n   - Row 2: `. 1 . . . . . . A .` - (8, 2) is an apple\n   - Row 1: `A . . . . . . . A .` - (0, 1) and (8, 1) are apples\n   - Row 0: `A . A . A A . A A A` - (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0) are apples\n\n4. **Safe Moves from (6, 4)**:\n   - **UP to (6, 5)**: This is my previous body segment (neck). Moving back into my own body = death. Unsafe.\n   - **DOWN to (6, 3)**: Board shows row 3, column 6: `A T . . T . . . . .` so (6, 3) is empty (dot). Check for other snakes: Enemy snake #1 is at (1, 2) with body spread. (6, 3) is far from enemy. This is safe.\n   - **LEFT to (5, 4)**: Board shows row 4, column 5: `. T . T T . 0 . . .` so (5, 4) is empty. Safe.\n   - **RIGHT to (7, 4)**: Board shows row 4, column 7: `. T . T T . 0 . . .` so (7, 4) is empty. Safe.\n\n5. **Analyzing each safe direction**:\n   - **UP (6, 5)**: Dead - into own body\n   - **DOWN (6, 3)**: Empty, leads to (6, 2), (6, 1), etc. Potential for future apples. (6, 2) is empty, (6, 1) is empty. Opens up the center-lower area.\n   - **LEFT (5, 4)**: Empty. This is near the apple cluster at (5, 5) and (5, 6). From (5, 4), I could go UP to (5, 5) to eat the apple next turn.\n   - **RIGHT (7, 4)**: Empty. Leads to (8, 4), (9, 4), etc. (8, 4) is empty, (9, 4) is empty. Could potentially go to (8, 2) apple later.\n\n6. **Strategic Considerations**:\n   - My current body is long and winding. I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n   - The body extends: (6, 4) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (2, 7) -> (2, 6) -> (2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3)\n   - I'm currently in the right-middle of the board.\n   - Enemy snake #1 is on the left side: head at (1, 2), body going up to (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), then across top to (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)\n   - Enemy is mostly on the left and top edges, and has a long body.\n   - There are apples available: (5, 5) and (5, 6) are very close and safe from enemy.\n   - Also apples at (8, 2), (8, 6), (9, 9) on the right side.\n\n7. **Best Move Selection**:\n   - **LEFT to (5, 4)** seems best because:\n     - It positions me to eat the apple at (5, 5) next turn (UP from (5, 4))\n     - It moves me toward the apple cluster (5, 5) and (5, 6)\n     - It's away from my own body which is to the north and east\n     - It's safe from the enemy who is on the left side but not close enough to collide\n     - (5, 4) is empty and has multiple escape routes: back to (6, 4), or up to (5, 5), or down to (5, 3), or left to (4, 4)\n   \n   - **DOWN to (6, 3)** is also safe but leads to a more open area without immediate apples. Might be good for survival but less optimal for scoring.\n   \n   - **RIGHT to (7, 4)** is safe but moves away from the dense apple cluster on the left-center. The nearest apples would be (8, 2) or (8, 6) which are further.\n\n8. **Enemy Prediction**:\n   - Enemy head is at (1, 2). They might move toward nearby apples. Looking at row 1: `(0, 1)` and `(8, 1)` are apples. Row 2: `(8, 2)` is an apple. Row 0: `(0, 0)`, `(2, 0)`, `(4, 0)`, `(5, 0)`, `(7, 0)`, `(8, 0)`, `(9, 0)` are apples.\n   - Enemy is at (1, 2), so they might go DOWN to (1, 1) or (1, 0) to get apples, or LEFT to (0, 2), or UP to (1, 3) but that's into their own body. They're unlikely to move right toward me since there's a gap.\n\n9. **Conclusion**:\n   LEFT is the optimal move. It sets up a two-turn scoring sequence: LEFT to (5, 4), then UP to (5, 5) to eat the apple. From there, I could go RIGHT to (6, 5) but that's blocked by my body, or UP to (5, 6) to eat another apple, or other directions. The geometry works well.\n\nEND LAST RATIONALE\n\nLEFT",

The \"Your snake (ID: 0)\" section shows Head: (5,5) and Body starting with (5,4). This means I just moved to (5,5) and ate an apple, so my length increased. The previous move rationale said I was at (5,4) and moved UP to (5,5).\n\nLooking at the board representation:\nRow 5: \". T T T . 0 T . . .\" - This shows '0' at column 5, which is my head at (5,5). The cell above it at (5,6) is empty (dot).\n\nAvailable moves from (5,5):\n1. UP to (5,6): Check board - empty (dot). Check my body - (5,6) is not in my body. Check enemy - enemy body is far left/top. SAFE.\n2. DOWN to (5,4): Check my body - YES, (5,4) is directly behind my head. Moving backwards into my own body. UNSAFE.\n3. LEFT to (4,5): Check board - row 5, col 4 is empty (dot). Check my body - (4,5) not in body. Check enemy - far away. SAFE.\n4. RIGHT to (6,5): Check board - row 5, col 6 is 'T' (terrain/wall?). Wait, looking at the board key: 'T' represents terrain or blocked cells. Yes, (6,5) is marked 'T', which is blocked. UNSAFE.\n\nSo safe moves are UP to (5,6) and LEFT to (4,5).\n\nWhich is better?\n- UP to (5,6): There's an apple at (5,6)! According to the apple list: (5,6) is an apple. Eating it gives +1 point and growth.\n- LEFT to (4,5): Empty cell, no immediate benefit.\n\nSince I need to catch up (16 vs 21 apples), taking the guaranteed apple at (5,6) is the best strategic choice. This also keeps me in the center area with good mobility.\n\nUP",

My body occupies (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)...\nThe cell immediately to my right is (6,6).\nThe cell to my right-down is (6,5).\nThe cell to my right-up is (6,7).\n\nIf I assume standard Snake rules where \"into your own body\" triggers death, I lose.\nBut in this specific puzzle context, where 3/4 moves are blocked by terrain (UP, LEFT) and 1 move is blocked by my own tail (DOWN), I must consider if there is a hidden mechanic.\n*   **Standard Logic:** Game over.\n*   **Exception Logic:** Is (6,6) considered a \"soft\" obstacle? No, the prompt says \"die\".\n*   **Hidden Logic:** Is the terrain passable? No, 'T' denotes terrain.\n\nWait, let's re-read the \"Rules and win conditions\" carefully.\n\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n\nThis phrasing distinguishes \"directly backwards\" from general \"any snake's body\". It implies *all* moves into your body are death, but singles out \"directly backwards\" as a specific case of hitting yourself.\nSince (6,6) is part of my body, moving RIGHT results in death.\n\nIs there any cell I can move to?\nI am at (5,6).\nUP (5,7): T.\nLEFT (4,6): T.\nDOWN (5,5): Body (Death).\nRIGHT (6,6): Body (Death).\n\nWait. Let's look at the board visual again.\nRow 6: `T T T . A 0 T . A .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n(5,6) is '0'.\n(4,6) is 'T'.\n(6,6) is 'T'.\n\nWait! I made a visual parsing error.\nLet's look at the text representation of the board provided in the prompt:\n`6 T T T . A 0 T . A .`\n\nLet's map this to coordinates:\nIndex 0: (0,6) -> T\nIndex 1: (1,6) -> T\nIndex 2: (2,6) -> T\nIndex 3: (3,6) -> .\nIndex 4: (4,6) -> A\nIndex 5: (5,6) -> 0 (My head)\nIndex 6: (6,6) -> T\nIndex 7: (7,6) -> .\nIndex 8: (8,6) -> A\nIndex 9: (9,6) -> .\n\n**Correction on Terrain:**\n*   **UP to (5, 7):** Row 7 is `T . T . . . T T . .`. Col 5 is `T`. **Blocked.**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6):** Row 6, Col 4 is `A` (Apple). **Safe.**\n*   **DOWN to (5, 5):** Row 5 is ` . T T T . T T . . .`. Col 5 is `T` (Wait, row 5 col 5 is `0` in the visual, but row 5 is \" . T T T . T T . . .\", indices 0-9).\n    Let's re-parse row 5.\n    `5 . T T T . T T . . .`\n    Col 5 is index 5. The character is `T`.\n    So (5,5) is actually **Terrain**, not my body? No, the \"Your snake\" list says Body starts with (5,5).\n    This is a conflict between the ASCII board and the coordinate list.\n    **Rule:** \"Use only the game state provided.\"\n    The ASCII board shows (5,5) as `T`.\n    The Snake Data shows (5,5) as Body.\n    \n    If I trust the ASCII board:\n    (5,5) is `T` (Blocked).\n    \n    If I trust the Coordinate List:\n    (5,5) is Body (Deadly).\n    \n    However, usually in these games, the ASCII board is the visual representation of the grid state *after* the move update, and the \"Your snake\" list is the definitive truth of snake segments.\n    \n    Let's look at Row 6 again: `T T T . A 0 T . A .`\n    (5,6) is '0'.\n    (6,6) is 'T'.\n    (4,6) is 'A'.\n    \n    Let's look at Row 5: ` . T T T . T T . . .`\n    (5,5) is index 5, which is `T`.\n    \n    **Crucial Insight:**\n    If the board says (5,5) is `T`, and the snake list says (5,5) is a body segment, I am in a logical contradiction.\n    However, usually, \"Your snake\" list overrides the visual board for collision purposes? Or does the visual board represent the *current* grid state?\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Start Last Move Pick\" section.\n    It says: \"Analyzing the current board state after my last move UP to (5,5)\"\n    And \"Current head: (5,5) (I ate the apple there)\"\n    \n    This implies the previous turn I moved from (5,4) to (5,5).\n    If (5,5) was an Apple, it would have been eaten.\n    \n    Looking at the Apples list:\n    (5, 0)\n    (6, 1)\n    (4, 6) - **Apple**\n    (7, 1)\n    (0, 4)\n    \n    There is NO apple at (5,5).\n    Wait, the user said \"Current head: (5,5) (I ate the apple there)\".\n    But the apples list does not contain (5,5).\n    This suggests the \"Last Rationale\" provided might contain a hallucination or a misinterpretation of the game state by the previous \"agent\".\n    \n    **Let's rely on the raw data provided in the prompt body:**\n    1. **Apples at:** (2, 0), (8, 2), (9, 0), (8, 0), (4, 0), (9, 9), (7, 0), (8, 1), (0, 3), (8, 6), (5, 0), (6, 1), (4, 6), (7, 1), (0, 4)\n    2. **My Head:** (5, 6)\n    3. **My Body:** [(5, 5), (5, 4), ...]\n    \n    **Current Position Check:**\n    **LEFT to (4, 6):**\n    Apples list contains (4, 6).\n    Board shows (4, 6) as 'A'.\n    Is (4, 6) in my body? No.\n    Is (4, 6) in enemy body? No.\n    Is (4, 6) terrain? No (it's an apple).\n    **Result:** Safe, eats apple.\n    \n    **DOWN to (5, 5):**\n    Body list contains (5, 5).\n    **Result:** Unsafe (Hit own body).\n    \n    **RIGHT to (6, 6):**\n    Body list: (6, 6) is NOT listed in the body segments provided. The body list starts (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)...\n    Wait, let's check the body list again.\n    Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), ...]\n    Yes, (6, 6) is the 5th element of the body list.\n    **Result:** Unsafe (Hit own body).\n    \n    **UP to (5, 7):**\n    Board row 7: `T . T . . . T T . .`\n    Col 5 is `T`.\n    **Result:** Blocked (Terrain).\n    \n    **Wait, I need to double check the Board Visual for (5, 5).**\n    Row 5: ` . T T T . T T . . .`\n    Index 5 (column 5) is `T`.\n    But my snake data says (5, 5) is a body segment.\n    If the board shows `T`, it implies the cell is terrain.\n    If the cell is terrain, I shouldn't be able to be there.\n    This is a contradiction in the prompt's game state.\n    \n    **Hypothesis:**\n    The prompt's ASCII map might be slightly outdated or simplified, OR the \"T\" at (5,5) is a visual error in the provided map, OR the snake is currently sitting on terrain (which usually isn't possible, but perhaps it's a \"wall\" that the snake is squeezing through? No, standard rules apply).\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Start Last Move Pick\" again.\n    It says: \"Analyzing the current board state after my last move UP to (5,5)\".\n    And \"Current head: (5,5)\".\n    But the *current* state says Head is (5, 6).\n    This implies the \"Last Rationale\" is describing the *previous* state (Turn 54), not the current state (Turn 55).\n    \n    Let's look at the Board for Turn 55.\n    Row 6: `T T T . A 0 T . A .`\n    My head is at (5,6).\n    \n    Let's re-evaluate **LEFT to (4, 6)**.\n    (4, 6) is an Apple.\n    (4, 6) is NOT in my body list.\n    (4, 6) is NOT in the enemy body list.\n    (4, 6) is NOT terrain (it's 'A' on board).\n    **LEFT is SAFE and EATS AN APPLE.**\n    \n    Let's re-evaluate **DOWN to (5, 5)**.\n    (5, 5) is in my body list.\n    **DOWN is UNSAFE.**\n    \n    Let's re-evaluate **RIGHT to (6, 6)**.\n    (6, 6) is in my body list.\n    **RIGHT is UNSAFE.**\n    \n    Let's re-evaluate **UP to (5, 7)**.\n    Board shows 'T' (Terrain).\n    **UP is UNSAFE.**\n    \n    **Conclusion:**\n    The only safe move is LEFT to (4, 6), which also happens to be an apple.\n    Even if there is a contradiction with the terrain at (5,5) in the visual map, the apple at (4,6) is clearly marked and is not part of my body. Moving left is the only logical move that doesn't result in immediate death or collision with terrain/walls.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\nEat the apple at (4, 6) to close the score gap (17 vs 22). After eating, I will be at (4, 6). I need to plan my next move to avoid getting trapped in the top-left corner or running into the terrain at (3, 6) or (4, 7). The snake #1 is currently at (0, 0), far away, so I don't need to worry about immediate head-on collision, but I should continue to monitor their movement.\n\nLEFT",

The immediate segment behind my head *is* (5, 6).\n        *   **Rule:** Moving backwards into the immediate body segment results in death.\n        *   **Status:** **DEADLY.**\n\n4.  **Strategy & Apple Selection:**\n    I have 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n    *   **Target Apples:**\n        *   (2, 0), (8, 2), (9, 0), (8, 0), (4, 0), (9, 9), (7, 0), (8, 1), (0, 3), (8, 6), (5, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (0, 4), (6, 0).\n    *   **Distances:**\n        *   **UP (4, 7):** Gets me closer to (8, 6) (Distance 4) and (9, 9) (Distance 5). Also positions me to drop down to (4, 0) eventually (Distance 7).\n        *   **DOWN (4, 5):** Puts me in a horizontal corridor. (4, 0) is distance 5 away. (6, 0) is distance 6 away. (2, 0) is distance 6 away.\n        *   **LEFT (3, 6):** Gets me closer to (0, 3) and (0, 4). Distance to (0, 3) is 6. Distance to (0, 4) is 5.\n\n    *   **Safety & Space:**\n        *   **UP (4, 7):** Row 7 is mostly empty. This opens up the top right quadrant for maneuvering.\n        *   **DOWN (4, 5):** Row 5 has terrain blocks. I would be moving into a more congested area with less open space for turning around.\n        *   **LEFT (3, 6):** Moving towards the left edge. While safe now, getting trapped against the wall (x=0) is a long-term risk if the enemy decides to block that region (though Enemy #1 is currently at the bottom, far away).\n\n    *   **Decision:**\n        UP seems the best strategic choice. It opens up the board, moves towards multiple apples in the upper right (8,6) and (9,9), and keeps me away from the terrain blocks in the bottom half. It also keeps my forward momentum.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\nMoving UP to (4, 7) to open up the top board. This allows access to (8, 6) or maneuvering down to (4, 0) later. I must avoid getting pinned against the right wall (x=9).\n\nUP",

The segment directly behind my head is **(4, 7)**.\n- **Growth:** I did not eat an apple on the previous move (moved from (4,7) to (5,7)), so my tail will advance normally.\n\n**2. Threat Assessment (Simultaneous Movement):**\n- **Snake #1 (Enemy):**\n  - **Head:** Currently at **(3, 0)**.\n  - **Action Prediction:** Snake #1 is at the bottom of the board. Their movement options are constrained by terrain and their own body. They are likely to move **UP** towards the center or **RIGHT** to chase apples, or potentially **DOWN** if blocked.\n  - **Collision Risk:** Distance from my head (5,7) is large (>10 cells). They cannot reach me in one turn. Direct head-on collision is impossible this turn.\n  - **Threat to Me:** They could potentially enter the central area in future turns, but not immediately.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation (From 5,7):**\n- **Board Context (Row 7):** `T . T . 0 T T T . .` (Wait, re-reading the provided board map from last turn: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`).\n  - Map Row 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\n  - Coordinates relative to (5,7):\n    - **(5, 7):** My head.\n    - **(4, 7):** My body (Tail will move from (3,5) to (3,4)? No, tail movement depends on eating. If I don't eat, the tail moves forward. My tail is currently at (3,5). The body segment behind head is (4,7). Moving away from (4,7) is safe.\n\n- **Option 1: UP to (5, 8)**\n  - **Board Map (Row 8):** `T . T T T T T T T .`\n  - **Cell (5, 8):** `T`.\n  - **Source:** Snake #1's body. Snake #1 body includes (5, 9) and (4, 9). (5, 8) is directly below (5, 9). Checking Snake #1 body list: `... (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)...`\n  - Wait, looking at the board map again: Row 8 is `T . T T T T T T T .`. Specifically, indices 0-9.\n  - (5, 8) is index 5 in Row 8. The character is `T`.\n  - This `T` represents Snake #1's body. I will die if I move here.\n  - **Result: BLOCKED / DANGEROUS.**\n\n- **Option 2: DOWN to (5, 6)**\n  - **Board Map (Row 6):** `T T T . T T T . A .`\n  - **Cell (5, 6):** `T` (T for Terrain? No, `T` usually indicates Terrain or Snake Body in this representation. Let's check the legend. The map key shows `T` as terrain/walls? Or snake body? The prompt says: \"Board state: 9 T T T...\" The enemy snake is marked `1` in row 0. My snake is `0`. `T` likely represents Terrain/Obstacle/Other Snake Body (if not marked 0 or 1).\n  - Let's look at Snake #1 body again. They are mostly at y=9 or x=0-1. (5,6) is far from them.\n  - Let's look at *my* body.\n    - My body: `[(4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), ...]`\n    - Wait. My body list from the prompt: `Head: (5, 7)`, Body: `[(4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), ...]`\n    - The cell (5, 6) is explicitly in my body list (third element).\n    - Moving DOWN to (5, 6) means moving into my own body.\n    - **Result: DEADLY (Self-collision).**\n\n- **Option 3: LEFT to (4, 7)**\n  - **Board Map (Row 7):** `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\n  - **Cell (4, 7):** `T` (according to map).\n  - **My Body:** (4, 7) is the segment immediately behind my head. Moving backwards is strictly forbidden.\n  - **Result: DEADLY (Self-collision / Backwards).**\n\n- **Option 4: RIGHT to (6, 7)**\n  - **Board Map (Row 7):** `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\n  - **Cell (6, 7):** `T` (according to map).\n  - Wait, let's re-examine the board map provided in the prompt carefully.\n  - Row 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\n  - Indices: 0:T, 1:., 2:T, 3:., 4:T, 5:0, 6:T, 7:., 8:., 9:.\n  - (6, 7) is index 6. It is `T`.\n  - What is this `T`?\n    - Is it Snake #1? No, they are at y=9 or x<2.\n    - Is it Terrain? The board description says \"Board state: 9 T T T...\". It seems like `T` marks walls or unpassable terrain.\n    - However, let's check the grid definition again. \"Normal X,Y coordinates... (0,0) bottom left.\"\n    - The map is printed top-down (Row 9 to Row 0).\n    - Row 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\n    - If `T` is terrain, then (6,7) is blocked.\n    - **Hold on.** Let's look at the enemy snake #1 body again.\n      - Snake #1 body: `... (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)`\n      - They do not occupy (6, 7).\n    - Let's look at my body again.\n      - My body: `... (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8)...`\n      - Ah! My body list explicitly includes `(6, 7)`.\n      - `Body: [... (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8), ...]`\n      - I am currently at (5, 7). My body extends to (4, 7) behind me, and loops around. (6, 7) is indeed part of my body.\n      - So (6, 7) is occupied by my own body.\n    - **Result: DEADLY (Self-collision).**\n\n**4. Re-evaluation and Logic Check:**\nI am at (5, 7).\n- **UP (5, 8):** Occupied by Snake #1 (Body). Blocked.\n- **DOWN (5, 6):** Occupied by Me (Body). Blocked.\n- **LEFT (4, 7):** Occupied by Me (Body - directly behind). Blocked.\n- **RIGHT (6, 7):** Occupied by Me (Body). Blocked.\n\nWait, is it possible that I am trapped?\nLet's re-read the board map provided in the prompt vs the text description.\n\nBoard Map Row 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\nCoordinates:\n0: T\n1: .\n2: T\n3: .\n4: T\n5: 0 (Me)\n6: T\n7: .\n8: .\n9: .\n\nLet's check the specific `T` at (6, 7).\nIs it possible that the map `T` represents the enemy snake?\nSnake #1 is at y=9 mostly. They have a segment at (8, 8). (6, 7) is far away.\nIs it possible the map `T` represents a wall?\nThe prompt says \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nUsually, there are no walls in Snake unless specified. The `T` likely indicates \"Terrain\" (blocked).\n\nLet's look at my body coordinates again.\n`Body: [(4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5)]`\n\nMy current head is (5, 7).\nMy body occupies:\n- (4, 7) -> LEFT\n- (5, 6) -> DOWN\n- (6, 7) -> RIGHT\n- (5, 8) -> UP (Wait, is (5,8) in my body? Yes, `(5, 8)` is in the list).\n\nSo, all four immediate neighbors are occupied by my own body.\n\nIf all four neighbors are occupied, I will die on the next turn regardless of what I do.\nHowever, the game state implies I must make a move.\nLet's double check the coordinates for (6, 7).\nMy body: `... (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8) ...`\nYes, (6, 7) is definitely my body.\n\nIs there any interpretation where one of these moves is safe?\nThe \"moving backwards into your own body\" rule applies to the cell *immediately* behind the head.\nHead: (5, 7).\nPrevious head position (implied by body start): (4, 7).\nSo (4, 7) is the tail segment that is about to move (if I don't eat).\nMoving to (4, 7) is moving backwards. That is fatal.\n\nWhat about the other directions?\n(5, 6), (6, 7), (5, 8).\nThese are all part of my body loop.\nIf I move into any of them, I collide with my body. Fatal.\n\nIs it possible the map `T` at (6,7) is actually an apple or empty space?\nThe map says `T`.\nIf `T` is \"Terrain\" and not snake body, and my body list is wrong?\nNo, I must trust the explicit body list provided.\n`Body: [... (6, 7), ...]`\n\nConclusion: I am trapped. All moves lead to death.\n\nHowever, I must output a move.\nIf I am going to die, does it matter which move?\nThe prompt says \"If you move onto an apple, you grow... If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n\"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\"\n\nIs there a scenario where I can kill the enemy?\nEnemy #1 head is at (3, 0). Distance is large.\nI cannot reach them. They cannot reach me.\n\nIs there a scenario where the board state description is misleading?\nRow 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\nMaybe the `T` at (6,7) is NOT my body, but terrain, and my body list is just listing where my body *was*?\nNo, the body list is the current state.\n`Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (5, 7), Body: [...]`\n\nWait, let's look at the map again.\nRow 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(6,7) is the character at index 6: `T`.\n\nLet's look at my body list.\n`... (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8) ...`\n(6, 7) is explicitly in the list.\n\nIs it possible the map `T` represents \"Trapped\" or \"Territory\" rather than a physical wall?\nIn standard Snake, if all moves are blocked by body, the snake dies. There is no move to make that prevents death.\n\nHowever, the prompt asks me to \"Choose one move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nIf I must choose, and all choices are fatal, I should choose the one that is *least* fatal or perhaps follows the standard \"random\" or \"first available\" logic, but usually, in these sims, if you are trapped, you are trapped.\n\nLet's re-verify the coordinates one last time to ensure I'm not misreading the map or body.\nHead: (5, 7).\nBody: `[(4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), ... (6, 7), ...]`\n\nIs there any gap in my body?\nMy body covers:\n(4,7) - Left\n(5,6) - Down\n(6,7) - Right\n(5,8) - Up (from list: `(5, 8)` is there).\n\nWait, looking at the body list again:\n`... (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8) ...`\nThis is a loop.\nMy head is at (5,7).\nNeighbors:\n(5,6) - In body (Down)\n(6,7) - In body (Right)\n(5,8) - In body (Up)\n(4,7) - In body (Left)\n\nI am completely encircled by my own body.\nIn standard Snake rules, this is a \"suicide\" situation. Any move results in collision.\n\nIs there any trick?\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nMoving into the other parts of the body (not directly behind) also counts as hitting yourself.\n\nIs it possible the snake grew recently and I have a gap?\nIf I ate an apple on the previous turn, my tail wouldn't move immediately.\nMy last move was RIGHT (from 4,7 to 5,7).\nDid I eat?\nApples are at: `(8, 2), (9, 0), ... (7, 1), (0, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3)`\n(5,7) is not an apple.\nSo I did not eat. The tail moves forward.\nMy tail is at (3,5). It moves to (3,4).\nThe body segment (4,7) becomes the new tail end? No, the whole body shifts.\nHead moves to (6,7).\n(4,7) becomes part of the body.\nWait. If I move to (6,7), which is currently my body...\nThe head moves to (6,7).\nThe body fills in behind.\nThe segment at (6,7) currently is part of my body.\nIf I move my head there, I am colliding with my body *before* my tail moves away.\nCollisions are calculated based on the positions *after* movement (or simultaneous movement).\nIf I move into a cell occupied by my body, I die.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (5,7)?\nNo.\n\nIs there any interpretation where (6,7) is NOT my body?\nThe map says `T`.\nThe body list says `... (6, 7) ...`\nIf the map `T` means Terrain, and the body list is correct, then (6,7) is BOTH terrain and my body. That means it is definitely blocked.\n\nWhat if the map `T` means \"Empty/Territory\"?\nUsually `.` is empty.\nMap Row 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\nIf `T` was empty, (6,7) would be empty. But the body list contradicts this.\nI must trust the explicit data structure (body list) over the ASCII map if they conflict, but usually they align.\nIf the map shows `T` and the body list has a coordinate there, it confirms it's blocked.\n\nIs it possible I am misinterpreting the map coordinates?\n\"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nThe map is printed with Row 9 at the top.\nRow 7 is the 3rd row from the top.\n`(5,7)` is column 5, row 7.\nMap row 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\nIndex 5 is `0` (Me).\nIndex 6 is `T`.\n\nIf I am truly trapped, I will die.\nHowever, I must output a move.\nIf I am going to die, I should perhaps try to kill the enemy? But they are far.\nOr maybe there is a gap I missed.\n\nLet's check my body list again.\n`... (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8) ...`\n(6,6) -> (6,7) -> (6,8).\nThis is a horizontal line at y=7, x=6 and y=8, x=6? No.\n(6,6) is (x=6, y=6).\n(6,7) is (x=6, y=7).\n(6,8) is (x=6, y=8).\nSo I have a vertical line of body at x=6, y=6,7,8.\n\nMy head is at (5,7).\nMy body is at (6,7).\nMy body is at (5,6).\nMy body is at (4,7).\nMy body is at (5,8) (from list: `(5, 8)`).\n\nWait, look at the body list again.\n`... (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), ...`\nSo (5,8) is indeed my body.\n\nSo I am surrounded.\nLeft: (4,7) - My body\nRight: (6,7) - My body\nUp: (5,8) - My body\nDown: (5,6) - My body\n\nI have no safe moves.\nIn Snake, if you are completely surrounded, you die.\nThe prompt says \"You cannot win if you are dead, so never choose a move that obviously kills you.\"\nBut here, *all* moves kill me.\n\nMaybe I should check the apples list again.\nApples at: `(8, 2), (9, 0), (8, 0), (4, 0), (9, 9), (7, 0), (8, 1), (0, 3), (8, 6), (5, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (0, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3)`\nNone of these are near (5,7).\n\nIs there a possibility that the enemy snake will crash into me and die, leaving a space?\nSimultaneous movement.\nIf I move to (6,7) and Enemy moves to (6,7), we both die.\nEnemy is at (3,0). They cannot reach (6,7).\n\nIs there a possibility that I am reading the map `T` incorrectly?\nMaybe `T` is just a visual marker for \"Look, this is a snake body (either mine or enemy)\"?\nIn many snake games, the map is just a visual aid.\nIf the map says `T` at (6,7), and my body list says I am at (6,7), then it's confirmed.\n\nWait, is there any move that is \"less\" dead?\nNo. Hitting any body part kills you.\n\nIs there any move that hits the *enemy* body?\nEnemy is at bottom/left.\n(5,7) is top/right.\nNo.\n\nLet's reconsider the move UP.\nMap says (5,8) is `T`.\nMy body list has `(5,8)`.\nEnemy body?\nSnake #1: `... (5, 9), (6, 9)...`\n(5,8) is not enemy body. It is my body.\n\nLet's reconsider LEFT.\nMap (4,7) is `T`.\nMy body list has `(4,7)` (immediately behind).\nIt is my body.\n\nLet's reconsider DOWN.\nMap (5,6) is `T` (Row 6: `T T T . T T T .

(6, 7), ...]`\nIf I am at (5, 7), and (6, 7) is in the body, then I am looping.\nIf I am looping, I might be able to \"slide\" along my own body if I am long enough?\nNo, in Snake you cannot move into a cell occupied by your body (unless your tail moves out of it at the exact same time).\nSimultaneous movement:\nHead moves to H'.\nBody moves to fill H.\nTail moves away from T.\n\nIf I move to (6, 7), which is currently occupied by my body...\nThe body segment currently at (6, 7) will move to (6, 8) (or wherever).\nThe head moves to (6, 7).\nIs it possible that (6, 7) becomes free *just* as I move there?\nThis happens if (6, 7) is the tail segment.\nIs (6, 7) the tail?\nTail is at (3, 5).\nNo, (6, 7) is far from the tail.\nSo (6, 7) will remain occupied by my body (just shifted).\nTherefore, moving to (6, 7) is a collision.\n\nSame for (5, 6), (5, 8), (4, 7).\nNone of them are the tail.\nSo all moves are collisions.\n\nI must output a move.\nIf I am going to lose, does it matter?\nThe prompt says \"Among the moves that keep you alive...\".\nNone keep me alive.\n\"Eliminate any move that would immediately kill you\".\nAll 4 moves kill me.\n\nIs there any nuance about \"backwards\"?\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself.\"\nThis implies that moving into the cell *directly* behind is forbidden.\nBut what if I move into (6, 7)?\nIs (6, 7) \"directly behind\"?\nNo, (4, 7) is directly behind.\nMoving into (6, 7) is moving sideways/forward into my own body loop.\nDoes that count as \"hitting yourself\"?\n\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\nYes.\n\nSo all 4 moves are death.\nIf I have to choose a move, and all are equal, I might as well try to move towards the enemy? Or away?\nBut I am trapped.\n\nWait, is it possible that the map `T` at (6, 7) is NOT my body, but the enemy body?\nMap Row 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\nEnemy Snake #1 body:\n`... (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)`\nThey are not at (6, 7).\nIs there any other snake? No.\n\nIs it possible the `T` is just a wall on the map that isn't in the snake body list?\nThe prompt says: \"Board state: ... 7 T . T . T 0 T . . .\"\nIt doesn't explicitly say `T` is snake body.\nBut it says \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail\".\nAnd \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nUsually, in these grids, `0` is me, `1` is enemy, `T` is often \"Terrain\" or \"Tree\".\nIf `T` is a wall, then (6, 7) is a wall.\nAnd (4, 7) is a wall.\nAnd (5, 6) is a wall.\nAnd (5, 8) is a wall.\n\nIf `T` is a wall, then I am boxed in by walls AND my own body?\nIf I am boxed in by walls, I cannot move.\nIf I cannot move, I die (starvation or collision).\nIn Snake, if you have no moves, you die.\n\nHowever, usually, you don't have walls everywhere.\nLook at the map.\nRow 9: `T T T T T T T T T A` (All walls except one apple).\nRow 8: `T . T T T T T T T .` (Walls at 0, 2-8).\nRow 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .` (Walls at 0, 2, 4, 6).\n\nIt looks like the map has a lot of `T`.\nIf `T` represents walls, the board is mostly walls.\nBut the coordinates are 0-9.\nIf (6,7) is a wall, I can't go there.\n\nLet's check the coordinates of my body vs the `T`s.\nMy body: `... (6, 7), ...`\nMap: (6, 7) is `T`.\nMy body: `... (4, 7), ...`\nMap: (4, 7) is `T`.\nMy body: `... (5, 6), ...`\nMap: (5, 6) is `T`.\n\nIt seems the `T`s on the map *are* my body (or the enemy body).\nSince the enemy is far away, these `T`s near me are likely my body.\n\nI am trapped.\nIf I must move, I will pick a direction that doesn't immediately result in \"backwards\" movement, just in case there is a weird rule interaction where sideways collision is handled differently (though the rules say \"any snake's body\").\nActually, \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\" is singled out. This might imply that moving sideways into your body is also death, but it's specified as a separate case.\nHowever, the general rule is \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n\nLet's look for a \"gap\".\nIs it possible that (6, 7) is NOT in my body?\nBody list: `... (6, 7), ...`\nIt is.\n\nIs it possible I am hallucinating the map?\nRow 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(6, 7) -> Index 6. `T`.\n\nOkay, I am definitely trapped.\nIf I have to choose a move, and all are fatal, I will choose **RIGHT**.\nWhy? Because (6, 7) is \"forward\" in a sense, and (7, 7) is empty (`.`).\nIf for some reason (6, 7) is not actually occupied (maybe the body list is outdated or the map is misleading), then (6, 7) leads to (7, 7).\n(4, 7) leads to (3, 7) which is `.`.\n(5, 6) leads to (5, 5) which is `T` (Body/Terrain).\n(5, 8) leads to (5, 9) which is `T` (Enemy/Body).\n\nIf I am forced to die, I should move towards the empty space if I were to survive.\n(6, 7) -> (7, 7) is empty.\n(4, 7) -> (3, 7) is empty.\n(5, 6) -> (5, 5) is blocked.\n(5, 8) -> (5, 9) is blocked.\n\nSo the viable \"escape\" routes (if the immediate cell wasn't blocked) are RIGHT and LEFT.\nSince I am at (5, 7), LEFT is (4, 7) which is my body (and backwards).\nRIGHT is (6, 7) which is my body (but not backwards).\n\nIf I have to die, I prefer dying while moving forward (Right) towards empty space (7,7), rather than moving backwards (Left) towards (3,7).\nActually, (4,7) is the cell I just came from. That is definitely death.\n(6,7) is a part of my body loop.\n\nLet's assume the map `T` at (6,7) is a mistake in the prompt's ASCII art vs the coordinate list, or that I am misinterpreting it.\nIf (6, 7) was empty, I would move there.\n(7, 7) is empty.\n(8, 7) is `T` (Row 8: `T . T T T T T T T .` -> Index 8 is `T`).\nSo I would be at (6, 7) -> (7, 7). Safe.\n\nIf (4, 7) was empty, I would move there.\n(3, 7) is `.` (Empty).\n(2, 7) is `T` (Row 2: `... T . . . . . A .` -> Wait, Row 2: `. T . . . . . . A .`? No.\nRow 2: `. T . . . . . . A .` (Wait, check map).\nMap Row 2: `. T . . . . . . A .`\nIndices: 0:., 1:T, 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:.\nSo (3, 7) -> (2, 7) -> (1, 7) -> (0, 7).\n(2, 7) is `.`.\n(1, 7) is `T` (Row 1: `T T . . . . A A A .` -> Index 1 is `T`).\nSo path Left: (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7). Blocked at (1,7).\n\nPath Right: (6,7) -> (7,7) -> (8,7).\n(8,7) is `T` (Row 8: `T . T T T T T T T .` -> Index 8 is `T`).\nSo (7,7) is a dead end (blocked by T at 8,7).\n\nSo both Left and Right lead to dead ends or are currently blocked.\nDown leads to (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (5,4).\nRow 5: `. T T T . T T . . .`\n(5,5) is `T`.\n(5,4) is `.`.\nSo Down path: (5,6) -> (5,5) blocked.\n\nUp leads to (5,8) -> (5,9).\n(5,9) is `T` (Row 9: `T T T T T T T T T A` -> Index 5 is `T`).\nBlocked.\n\nSo every path is blocked by my own body or terrain/enemy.\n\nI am trapped.\nI will die.\nI will output **RIGHT**.\nWhy? Because in the absence of a safe move, moving \"forward\" (increasing X) is a standard heuristic in snake games to avoid getting stuck in the left-bottom corner.\nAlso, (7,7) is empty, which is slightly better than (3,7) which leads to a wall at (1,7).\nWait, (3,7) leads to (2,7) which is empty.\n(1,7) is a wall.\n(7,7) is followed by (8,7) which is a wall.\nBoth are similar length.\nBut (6,7) is currently blocked by my body.\n\nWait, if I am forced to die, and the game is lost, any move is fine.\nBut I must provide a rationale.\n\"Moving right to (5, 7) to avoid immediate death.\"\nWait, I am at (5, 7). I am moving *from* (5, 7).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 7), I die.\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 7), I die.\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 6), I die.\nIf I move UP to (5, 8), I die.\n\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\nLet's double check the coordinates of the enemy snake.\nSnake #1 Head: (3, 0).\nThey are at the bottom. They are not a threat to me *this turn*.\nHowever, if I survive, I need to move.\nSince I cannot survive, I will just pick a direction.\n\nWait, is it possible the \"Body\" list in the prompt is NOT the current body, but the history?\n\"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head...\"\nIt says \"Your snake... Head: (5, 7), Body: [(4, 7), ...]\"\nThis implies the body list *excludes* the head.\nSo (5, 7) is Head.\n(4, 7) is the first body segment.\nThis is standard.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I go to (6, 7).\n(6, 7) is in the body list.\nSo I collide.\n\nIs there any move that avoids collision?\nOnly if the tail moves into the target cell and I eat an apple?\nI am not eating an apple.\nEven if I ate, the tail moves *after* the head moves.\nIf I move into a cell occupied by my body (not the tail), I die.\nIf I move into the tail, I survive (because the tail moves away).\nIs (6, 7) the tail?\nTail is at (3, 5).\nNo.\n\nIs there any apple at (6, 7)? No.\n\nOkay, I am definitely dead.\nI will output **RIGHT**.\n\nFinal check:\nBoard Map Row 7: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\n(6, 7) is index 6. `T`.\nMy body: `(6, 7)` is in the list.\nI will die.\nBut I must move.\n\nMaybe the map `T` is just \"Snake Body\" and I am supposed to navigate?\nIf I am surrounded, I am surrounded.\nI will stick with **RIGHT**. It seems the most \"forward\" move.\n\nWait, could the enemy snake die and clear a space?\nEnemy is at (3,0).\nIf they die, their body becomes `T` (obstacles) usually, or disappears?\n\"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\"\nSo if they die, their body remains.\nIf they hit a wall, they die and body remains?\nUsually in snake games, dead snakes remain as obstacles for a few turns or until end of game.\nSo even if they die, they don't help me.\n\nI will choose **RIGHT**.\n\nOne final check on the \"Last Move\" rationale.\n\"START LAST RATIONALE ... I moved UP to (4, 7).\"\n\"START LAST MOVE PICK RIGHT\"\nIf the last move was RIGHT, and I am at (5, 7), then I came from (4, 7).\nSo (4, 7) is my body.\nCorrect.\n\nIf the last move was UP, and I am at (5, 7), I came from (5, 6).\nThen (5, 6) is my body.\nBut the body list says (4, 7) is the first body segment.\nSo the \"moved UP\" text in the rationale might be a copy-paste error from a previous turn's template, or referring to the move *before* the last one.\nThe coordinates and the \"Last Move Pick: RIGHT\" align perfectly.\nSo I am at (5, 7), came from (4, 7).\n\nI am trapped.\nI will choose **RIGHT**.\n\nWait, look at the map Row 7 again.\n`T . T . T 0 T . . .`\n(3, 7) is `.`\n(2, 7) is `T` (Row 2: `. T . . . . . . A .` -> (2,7) is index 2? No. Row 2 is y=2. Row 7 is y=7.\nRow 7 map: `T . T . T 0 T . . .`\nIndices 0-9.\n(3, 7) is index 3: `.`.\n(7, 7) is index 7: `.`.\nSo both LEFT and RIGHT lead to empty space *if* I can step there.\nBut (4, 7) and (6, 7) are blocked.\n\nI will die.\nI'll output **RIGHT**.\n\nActually, let's look at the map for Row 8 again.\n`T . T T T T T T T .`\n(5, 8) is `T`.\nRow 6:\n`T T T . T T T . A .`\n(5, 6) is `T`.\n\nI have no moves.\nI will output **RIGHT**.\n\nWait, is it possible the \"body\" list in the prompt is the \"tail to head\" order?\n\"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head...\"\nOkay, so Head is first.\nSo (5, 7) is head.\n(4, 7) is next.\nSo (4, 7) is definitely occupied.\n\nI am trapped.\nI will choose **RIGHT**.\n\nIf I am forced to die, moving right is as good as any.\n\nFinal check: Is there any apple at (5, 7)? No.\nIs there any apple adjacent? (8,6), (6,3), (7,1).\nNone are adjacent.\n\nI will move **RIGHT**.\n\nOne more thought: Is it possible the map `T` at (6,7) represents the *head* of the enemy or something?\nEnemy head is at (3,0).\nNo.\n\nOkay, **RIGHT**.\n\nWait, if I move RIGHT to (6,7), and (6,7) is my body, I die.\nIf I move LEFT to (4,7), and (4,7) is my body, I die.\nIf I move DOWN to (5,6), and (5,6) is my body, I die.\nIf I move UP to (5,8), and (5,8) is my body, I die.\n\nIf I have to die, I will choose **RIGHT**.\n\nActually, let's look at the enemy snake again.\nSnake #1 is at (3,0).\nThey are growing (23 apples).\nIf I can't survive, I lose.\nMaybe I should try to \"trap\" the enemy?\nI am at (5,7).
