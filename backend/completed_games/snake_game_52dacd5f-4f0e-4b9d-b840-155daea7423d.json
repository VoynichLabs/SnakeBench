Avoid moving too far away from these apples to ensure a quick growth.\n- **Enemy Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the enemy snake's head position to avoid potential collisions.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe move that is both safe and most advantageous is moving LEFT to (6, 3), which is closest to an apple and keeps options open.\n\nLEFT",

However, if Snake #0 moves LEFT to (1,5), it could collide with your body if you move UP. **Risky if Snake #0 moves LEFT.**\n\n   - **Follow-up:** Next move could go **LEFT to (3,7)** or **RIGHT to (5,7)**.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 6):**\n   - **Apple:** No apple at (5, 6).\n   - **Body check:** Safe (body is at [(4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3)]).\n   - **Enemy check:** Snake #0 is at (1, 6). Moving DOWN to (5,6) is **safe** because Snake #0 is at (1,6), which is **above your head (4,6) to (5,6)**. No immediate collision risk.\n   - **Follow-up:** Next move could go **LEFT to (4,6)** (but (4,6) is your head, so invalid) or **RIGHT to (6,6)**.\n\n3. **LEFT to (3, 6):**\n   - **Apple:** No apple at (3, 6).\n   - **Body check:** Safe (body is at [(4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3)]).\n   - **Enemy check:** Snake #0 is at (1, 6). Moving LEFT to (3,6) is **safe** because Snake #0 is at (1,6), which is **above your head (4,6) to (3,6)**. No immediate collision risk.\n   - **Follow-up:** Next move could go **UP to (3,7)** or **DOWN to (4,6)**.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 6):**\n   - **Apple:** No apple at (5, 6).\n   - **Body check:** Safe (body is at [(4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3)]).\n   - **Enemy check:** Snake #0 is at (1, 6). Moving RIGHT to (5,6) is **safe** because Snake #0 is at (1,6), which is **above your head (4,6) to (5,6)**. No immediate collision risk.\n   - **Follow-up:** Next move could go **UP to (5,7)** or **LEFT to (4,6)**.\n\n#### **Optimal Move:**\n- **DOWN to (5, 6)** is the best choice because:\n  - It keeps you **directly below Snake #0**, minimizing collision risk.\n  - It opens up **more follow-up options** (LEFT to (4,6) or RIGHT to (6,6)) compared to LEFT or RIGHT.\n  - It avoids getting trapped in a corner or blocking future moves.\n\n#### **Enemy Threat Assessment:**\n- Snake #0 is at **(1, 6)** with no body. It will likely move LEFT to **(1,5)** (since it\u2019s stationary, but if it moves, it\u2019s a risk). Moving DOWN to **(5,6)** keeps you safe.\n\n#### **Long-Term Plan for Turns 7-9:**\n1. **Turn 7:**\n   - Move **LEFT to (4,6)** to prepare for the next apple at **(5,0)**.\n\n2. **Turn 8:**\n   - If at **(4,6)**, move **DOWN to (5,6)** or **LEFT to (3,6)** to reach **(5,0)**.\n\n3. **Turn 9:**\n   - If **(5,0)** is eaten, shift toward **(9,5)**.\n\n---\n**Final Decision:**\nDOWN",
