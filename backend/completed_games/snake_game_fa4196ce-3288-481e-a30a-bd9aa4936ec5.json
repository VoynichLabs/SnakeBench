I can then continue moving DOWN to reach it.\nIf I move DOWN, I risk getting too close to the enemy snake at (7, 8), which could potentially cut me off.\n\nThe safer and more strategic move seems to be moving LEFT first, which gets me closer to the nearest apple while keeping distance from the enemy snake.\n\n## Plan\n\nI'll move LEFT now toward (8, 9), then plan to continue DOWN toward the apple at (8, 6). This gives me a clear path to an apple while avoiding potential collisions with the enemy snake.\n\nFor future turns, I'll prioritize collecting apples while maintaining safe distance from the other snake.

This gives me a clear path to an apple while avoiding potential collisions with the enemy snake.\n\nFor future turns, I'll prioritize collecting apples while maintaining safe distance from the other snake.

There's an enemy Snake #2 at position (7, 8) with no body segments.\n3. There are 5 apples on the board at: (0, 2), (3, 1), (9, 2), (0, 3), (8, 6).\n4. The closest apple to me appears to be at (8, 6), which is down and to the left.\n\n## Strategy Options\n\nSince I'm starting at the top right corner (9, 9), I have two possible moves:\n- LEFT to (8, 9)\n- DOWN to (9, 8)\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'll be one step closer to the apple at (8, 6). I can then continue moving DOWN to reach it.\nIf I move DOWN, I risk getting too close to the enemy snake at (7, 8), which could potentially cut me off.\n\nThe safer and more strategic move seems to be moving LEFT first, which gets me closer to the nearest apple while keeping distance from the enemy snake.\n\n## Plan\n\nI'll move LEFT now toward (8, 9), then plan to continue DOWN toward the apple at (8, 6). This gives me a clear path to an apple while avoiding potential collisions with the enemy snake.\n\nFor future turns, I'll prioritize collecting apples while maintaining safe distance from the other snake. After getting the apple at (8, 6), I might consider heading toward the apple at (9, 2) or evaluating which apple is safest to pursue next.\n\nLEFT"
