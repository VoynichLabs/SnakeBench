Let me start by understanding the current board state.\n\nThe head of my snake is at (8,9), which is the top right corner. The enemies are snake #1 at (4,6). The apples are at (4,2), (2,5), (9,0), (3,7), (7,1). \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best path to collect the apples without running into walls, other snakes, or myself. Since my snake is just the head right now, I don't have to worry about my own body yet. But if I move, I'll start growing.\n\nThe last move was RIGHT. So the snake moved from (7,9) to (8,9). Wait, but the head was at (8,9) before the last move. Maybe the last move was a RIGHT from (7,9) to (8,9). But in the current state, the head is at (8,9). So the next move will be from there.\n\nMy first thought is to collect the apples. Let's look at the apples' positions. The closest ones might be (7,1) and (3,7), (9,0). Let's calculate distances. The head is at (8,9). \n\nLooking at (9,0): that's diagonally down and right. To get there from (8,9), I would need to move right once (to x=9, y=9) but then down 9 steps. But that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe (7,1) is closer. From (8,9) to (7,1): x decreases by 1, y decreases by 8. So moving left and down. But maybe that's a long path. Alternatively, (3,7) is at x=3, y=7. From (8,9), that's moving left 5 steps and down 2. Hmm. (4,2) is x=4, y=2. From (8,9), that's left 4 and down 7. (2,5) is x=2, y=5: left 6, down 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (",

The apples are at (4,2), (2,5), (9,0), (3,7), (7,1). \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best path to collect the apples without running into walls, other snakes, or myself. Since my snake is just the head right now, I don't have to worry about my own body yet. But if I move, I'll start growing.\n\nThe last move was RIGHT. So the snake moved from (7,9) to (8,9). Wait, but the head was at (8,9) before the last move. Maybe the last move was a RIGHT from (7,9) to (8,9). But in the current state, the head is at (8,9). So the next move will be from there.\n\nMy first thought is to collect the apples. Let's look at the apples' positions. The closest ones might be (7,1) and (3,7), (9,0). Let's calculate distances. The head is at (8,9). \n\nLooking at (9,0): that's diagonally down and right. To get there from (8,9), I would need to move right once (to x=9, y=9) but then down 9 steps. But that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe (7,1) is closer. From (8,9) to (7,1): x decreases by 1, y decreases by 8. So moving left and down. But maybe that's a long path. Alternatively, (3,7) is at x=3, y=7. From (8,9), that's moving left 5 steps and down 2. Hmm. (4,2) is x=4, y=2. From (8,9), that's left 4 and down 7. (2,5) is x=2, y=5: left 6, down 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (",

The snake is moving down each turn. Let's think about possible moves.\n\nIf I go UP, that would take the head to (7,6), but that's where the snake was before. Wait, the body is empty now, so moving up would be okay. Wait, last move was DOWN to (7,7). So if I move UP next, the head goes back to (7,6). But since the snake's body is empty, that's allowed.

I don't see any risky moves that would lead to running into a wall or another snake, so I'll just focus on moving down.\n\nSince my priority is to reach the apple at (4, 2), I think my next strategy is to keep track of my distance to the apple and update my plan accordingly. If I hit the apple, I'll reassess the board and see where my next closest apple is.\n\nAlright, making my decision...\n\nDown!",

The last move was DOWN, which makes sense because dealing with the apples on the board. Let me look at the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 0 (bottom) has apples at (0,0) and (9,9). Row 1 has an apple at (9,0) maybe? Wait, the apples are listed as (2,5), (9,0), (3,7), (7,1), (0,0). Wait, (0,0) is on row 0, which is the bottom. Then (9,0) would be x=9, y=0, which is the bottom right corner. Then (3,7) is at x=3, y=7. (7,1) is x=7, y=1. (2,5) is x=2, y=5.\n\nThe current snake's head is at (7,7). The enemy snake #1 has head at (4,1) and body [(4,2)]. So the enemy is moving up from (4,2) to (4,1)? Or wait, since the body is (4,2), then the head is (4,1), so the enemy came from (4,2) down to (4,1)? Wait, but in the board state, row 2 is at y=2. The snake #1's head is at (4,1), which is row 1, and body at (4,2) which is row 2. So the enemy snake is moving down from (4,2) to (4,1). Or maybe opposite? Because the body segments are listed in order. The body is [(4,2)], so the head is (4,1), then body segments follow. So the enemy is moving down each turn? Because the next segment would be moving to (4,1)'s position if it moves further down. Hmm, not sure. But the enemy is at (4,1) now. \n\nThe apples available are (2,5), (9,0), (3,7), (7,1), (0,0).

Let's look at the board.\n\nThe apples are at (2,5), (9,0), (3,7), (7,1), and (0,0). The current head is at (7,7). So the apple at (3,7) is on the same y-coordinate but left by 4 units. The snake is moving down each turn. Let's think about possible moves.\n\nIf I go UP, that would take the head to (7,6), but that's where the snake was before. Wait, the body is empty now, so moving up would be okay. Wait, last move was DOWN to (7,7). So if I move UP next, the head goes back to (7,6). But since the snake's body is empty, that's allowed. Because the only part is the head. So moving up would not hit any body parts. But is that a good idea? Alternatively, maybe go left or right to reach the (3,7) apple.\n\nWait, (3,7) is at x=3, y=7. The current head is at (7,7). So to reach (3,7), the snake needs to move left 4 times. But the snake's body is empty, so moving left would be possible. But each move changes direction. Alternatively, maybe go left, but let's check the board for obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 3 (y=7) has an apple at (3,7). The snake's head is at (7,7). So moving left would take the head from (7,7) to (6,7), then (5,7), etc. But the path to (3,7) might be clear. Let me check the board for any obstacles in that area. The board shows that row 3 (y=7) has the apple at (3,7) and the snake's head is at (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,1) and body (4,2) maybe. So in row 7, there's the snake's head. So moving left along y=7 would be possible as long as there are no other",
