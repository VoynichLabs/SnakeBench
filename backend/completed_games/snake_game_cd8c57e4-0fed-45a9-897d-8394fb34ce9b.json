I will keep the output strictly to the required format.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Game State Analysis:**\n    *   **Board:** 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n    *   **Turn:** 0/150.\n    *   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (5,0). Body is empty (length 1). No apples collected yet.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Head at (3,7). Body empty. No apples collected yet.\n    *   **Apples:** List of coordinates provided.\n    *   **Last Move:** None (Game start).\n\n2.  **Immediate Safety Assessment (My Moves):**\n    My head is at (5,0).\n    *   **UP:** Target (5,1). Inside board. Checking collisions: No snake bodies at (5,1) (My body is empty, Enemy body is empty). Safe.\n    *   **DOWN:** Target (5,-1). Outside board (y must be >= 0). **Unsafe (Death).**\n    *   **LEFT:** Target (4,0). Inside board. Checking collisions: No snake bodies. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target (6,0). Inside board. Checking collisions: No snake bodies. Safe.\n\n    *Available Safe Moves:* UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n3.  **Apple Proximity & Strategy:**\n    I need to collect apples to win. I should move towards the nearest apples while maintaining safety and keeping future options open.\n    Current Head: (5,0).\n    Nearby Apples:\n    *   (1,0): Distance 4 (Left).\n    *   (2,5): Distance 7 (Up/Left).\n    *   (8,1): Distance 3 (Right/Up).\n    *   (5,7): Distance 7 (Up).\n    *   (5,9): Distance 9 (Up).\n    \n    The closest apple is (8,1), but there is also (1,0) and (8,1) is blocked by an apple at (2,5) in the vertical path? Let's look at the board state provided in text format to verify.\n\n    Board Visualization (Y from 9 to 0, X from 0 to 9):\n    9 . . . . A A . . A .\n    8 . . A . . . A . . .\n    7 . . . 1 . A . . . .\n    6 . . . . . . . A . .\n    5 . . A . A . . . A .\n    4 . . . A . . . . . .\n    3 . . . . . . . . . .\n    2 . . . . . . . . . A\n    1 A . . . . . . . A .\n    0 . A . . . 0 . . . .\n      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n    Wait, the board text shows `(0, 1)` as an apple in the text list, but in the text board row 1, column 0 is `A`. Row 0, column 1 is `A`.\n    Let's map the apples from the text board:\n    Row 9: (4,9), (5,9), (8,9) [Matches list: (4,9), (5,9), (8,9)]\n    Row 8: (2,8), (6,8) [Matches list: (2,8), (6,8)]\n    Row 7: (3,7) is Enemy Head. (5,7) is Apple. [Matches list: (5,7)]\n    Row 6: (7,6) [Matches list: (7,6)]\n    Row 5: (2,5), (4,5), (8,5) [Matches list: (2,5), (4,5), (8,5)]\n    Row 4: (3,4) [Matches list: (3,4)]\n    Row 3: None.\n    Row 2: (9,2) [Matches list: (9,2)]\n    Row 1: (0,1), (8,1) [Matches list: (0,1), (8,1)]\n    Row 0: (1,0) [Matches list: (1,0)]\n\n    **Checking Moves:**\n\n    *   **Move LEFT to (4,0):**\n        *   Distance to apple (1,0) is 3.\n        *   Distance to apple (0,1) is 5.\n        *   This moves towards the cluster of apples on the bottom left (1,0) and (0,1).\n        *   Future options: From (4,0), I can go Left to (3,0), then Left to (2,0). (1,0) is directly left.\n        *   *Risk:* The enemy snake is at (3,7). It is far away vertically (7 rows up). It is unlikely to reach the bottom left apples immediately. I can likely eat (1,0) and (0,1) safely in a few turns.\n\n    *   **Move RIGHT to (6,0):**\n        *   Distance to apple (8,1) is 3 (Right 2, Up 1).\n        *   Distance to apple (9,2) is 5.\n        *   This moves towards the right side apples.\n        *   *Risk:* The enemy snake is at (3,7). If the enemy moves Down and Right aggressively, there is a possibility of collision in the mid-field. However, (6,0) is currently safe.\n        *   *Opportunity:* There is an apple at (5,7) directly above the enemy snake's start (3,7) and (5,7). If I go Right, the enemy might compete for (5,7) or (8,5). Going Right puts me on a path to (8,1) and potentially (8,5).\n\n    *   **Move UP to (5,1):**\n        *   This puts me directly below the apple at (5,7).\n        *   The path is vertical, but there is an apple at (4,5) and (2,5) to the left, and (5,7) ahead.\n        *   *Risk:* The enemy is at (3,7). If I go UP to (5,1), the enemy might move towards (5,7). A head-on collision is possible if we both rush the center. Also, moving UP puts me directly below the apple cluster at Y=5 (2,5), (4,5). This might be contested territory.\n        *   *Observation:* The apple at (5,7) is directly next to the enemy's starting Y position (7). The enemy has a very short distance to that apple (Distance = 2). If I go UP, I am committing to a race for (5,7) where the enemy has a head start (or at least equal distance if I go straight, but the enemy starts closer).\n\n    **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   Avoiding direct conflict is key at Turn 0. The enemy is closer to the center-left apples (like (5,7)).\n    *   The apples at (1,0) and (0,1) on the far bottom-left are currently unthreatened. The enemy is at (3,7). Even if the enemy moves optimally down-left, it will take several turns to reach the bottom left.\n    *   By moving **LEFT** to (4,0), I secure a safe path to two apples ((1,0) and (0,1)) without immediate competition.\n    *   Moving RIGHT or UP enters the central area where the enemy is currently located or can easily reach.\n\n    **Choice:** LEFT.\n\n    **Plan for future self:**\n    Continue moving Left to reach (1,0) and then (0,1). Avoid the center until I have grown a bit or the enemy's position is clear. The bottom left quadrant is currently safe.\n\n4.  **Final Verification:**\n    *   Move LEFT to (4,0).\n    *   Check boundaries: x=4 is within 0-9. y=0 is within 0-9.\n    *   Check collisions: No body at (4,0).\n    *   Check enemy prediction: Enemy at (3,7). Moving towards me is unlikely to cause immediate collision on turn 1.\n    *   Result: Safe, progresses towards apples, avoids conflict.\n\n    Decision: LEFT.\n\nSTART LAST RATIONALE\nMoving Left to (4,0) to head towards the safe apple cluster at (1,0) and (0,1) on the bottom-left. The enemy snake is far away at (3,7) and likely heading towards the center apples (like (5,7)), so the bottom-left route is currently unthreatened and offers a safe early game growth path.\nEND LAST RATIONALE\n\nLEFT",

Since the turn counter is 1, the enemy has just moved. I do not see the enemy's new position in the provided text, but I must assume they are still on the board. The board text shows \"1\" at (3,7), which might be the previous state or the current state if they haven't moved yet. Wait, the prompt says \"Turn: 1 / 150\". The \"Board state\" provided usually reflects the state *before* the move for this turn. Let's look at the board again.\n- Board state shows: \"7 . . . . 1 A . . . .\"\n  This indicates the enemy is at (3,7) (since '1' is at index 3 of that row, and row 7 corresponds to y=7).\n  Wait, the board row representation: \"7 . . . . 1 A . . . .\"\n  Let's check the coordinates:\n  Row 7: X=0 is '.', X=1 is '.', X=2 is '.', X=3 is '1', X=4 is '.', X=5 is 'A'...\n  So the enemy is at (3,7).\n  This is the state at the *start* of Turn 1.\n  Since the prompt says \"Turn: 1\", I need to make a move for Turn 1.\n  The enemy will also make a move for Turn 1.\n  I cannot see the enemy's move, so I must play defensively and assume they might move towards me or apples.\n\n- My current position: (4,0).\n- Available moves from (4,0):\n  - UP: (4,1). Is it safe?\n    - Board at (4,1): Row 1 is \"1 A . . . . . . . A .\". Index 4 is '.'.\n    - No snakes listed there.\n    - Is it a valid move? Yes.\n  - DOWN: (4,-1). Invalid (off board).\n  - LEFT: (3,0).\n    - Board at (3,0): Row 0 is \". A . . . 0 . . . .\". Index 3 is '.'.\n    - Safe from obstacles.\n    - Is it safe from enemy? Enemy is at (3,7). If enemy moves Down, they go to (3,6). If they keep moving down, they might reach (3,0) eventually, but not immediately.\n    - However, I need to consider the \"backwards\" rule. My previous move was LEFT (from 5,0 to 4,0). Moving LEFT again would be (3,0). Is that moving into my own body? No, because my body is empty (length 1). The \"moving directly backwards into your own body\" rule applies when length > 1. Since I have no body, I can move in any direction that isn't off-board or into a wall/snake body.\n  - RIGHT: (5,0).\n    - Board at (5,0): Row 0 is \". A . . . 0 . . . .\". Index 5 is '0' (my previous head position).\n    - Wait, my current head is at (4,0). My previous head was at (5,0).\n    - If I move RIGHT to (5,0), I am moving into the cell I just vacated. Since my body is empty, this cell is currently empty.\n    - Is it safe? Yes.\n\n- Apples:\n  - (1,0) is an apple. Distance from (4,0) is 3.\n  - (0,1) is an apple. Distance is 4.\n  - (2,5) is an apple. Distance is 6.\n  - (8,1) is an apple. Distance is 5.\n  - (5,7) is an apple. Distance is 7.\n\n- Strategy:\n  I am at (4,0). The apple at (1,0) is very close.\n  If I go LEFT to (3,0), I am one step closer to (1,0).\n  If I go LEFT to (3,0), my body will grow to length 2 (Head at 3,0, Tail at 4,0) *after* eating an apple, but currently I haven't eaten. Actually, if I don't eat, my body remains length 1 (or 0?). Wait, \"Body: none\" means length 1 (head only).\n  If I move to (3,0), I am moving closer to (1,0).\n  The enemy is at (3,7). They are far away.\n  Moving LEFT seems the most efficient path to the nearest apple (1,0).\n  Moving UP or RIGHT moves me away from the nearest apples.\n  Moving DOWN is impossible.\n\n- Collision Check for LEFT (3,0):\n  - Is (3,0) occupied?\n  - Board row 0: \". A . . . 0 . . . .\"\n  - Index 3 is '.'.\n  - No wall. No apple listed there (apples are at 1,0 and 0,1).\n  - No snake bodies there (Enemy is at 3,7).\n  - Is there a risk of the enemy moving into (3,0)? No, they are too far.\n  - Is there a risk of me moving into the enemy? No.\n\n- Plan:\n  Move LEFT to (3,0) to approach the apple at (1,0) and (0,1). This is a safe direction with no immediate threats.\n\nDecision:\nLEFT\n\nResponse:\nLEFT",

My previous move was LEFT (from 4,0 to 3,0).\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 7).\n- Apples are at (1, 0), (0, 1), among others.\n- Board state: My current head is at (3, 0). The board row 0 shows \" . A . . . 0 . . . . \" at indices 0-9. Wait, the provided board state shows \"0\" at index 5. This must be a display artifact or a stale representation. I know from my move history that I moved LEFT to (3, 0). So (3, 0) is my current head. The board shows (1, 0) as an apple ('A').\n\n- Move Analysis from (3, 0):\n  - **UP (3, 1)**: \n    - Row 1 is \"1 A . . . . . . . A .\" (indices 0-9).\n    - Index 3 is '.' (empty).\n    - This is a valid move.\n    - It is not directly into an apple immediately, but (1, 0) is an apple to the left, and (0, 1) is an apple up-left. Moving UP puts me at (3, 1), one step away from (2, 1) and (1, 1), which are paths to the apple at (1, 0).\n  - **LEFT (2, 0)**:\n    - Row 0 index 2 is '.'.\n    - This moves me towards the apple at (1, 0).\n    - However, I must consider the enemy's move. The enemy is at (3, 7). They are likely moving towards apples at (3, 5) or (4, 9). If the enemy moves down to (3, 6) and subsequently down, they could threaten my vertical space.\n    - If I go LEFT to (2, 0), I am committed to (1, 0). If the enemy moves aggressively, I might be trapped in the bottom row (y=0) or the left column (x=0).\n    - Moving LEFT restricts my future moves (only UP or LEFT available next turn, unless I eat and grow, which opens up RIGHT).\n  - **RIGHT (4, 0)**:\n    - Row 0 index 4 is '.'.\n    - This moves me back to my previous spot. It doesn't make progress towards apples (nearest are to the left/up). It is a safe move but stalls.\n  - **DOWN (3, -1)**:\n    - Invalid (off board).\n\n- Strategy & Safety:\n  - The enemy is at (3, 7). If they move DOWN repeatedly, they will reach y=0 in 7 turns. I am at y=0. I need to get off the bottom row (y=0) to avoid being cornered.\n  - The apple at (1, 0) is \"bait\". While tempting (distance 2), moving LEFT commits me to the bottom edge.\n  - Moving UP to (3, 1) is safer. It moves me away from the edge. It keeps (1, 0) and (0, 1) in play but allows me to maneuver.\n  - If I go UP, I am at (3, 1). From there, I can go LEFT to (2, 1) or UP again. This gives me more options.\n  - If the enemy moves down aggressively, being at y=1 is safer than y=0.\n  - Additionally, (3, 1) is empty. There are no snakes there.\n  - Consider the \"backwards\" rule. If I go UP to (3, 1), my body will be at (3, 0). On the next turn, I cannot go DOWN (into myself). But from (3, 1), I have UP, LEFT, RIGHT. That's plenty of room.\n\n- Final Decision:\n  Moving UP is the safest play. It avoids the bottom edge trap and keeps me centrally located relative to the enemy's vertical path. I will pursue the apples at (1, 0) and (0, 1) more carefully from a higher Y coordinate.\n\nResponse:\nUP",

Top left quadrant.\n        *   (1, 0): Distance 4 (Left 2, Down 2). Bottom left corner.\n        *   (0, 1): Distance 4 (Left 3, Down 1). Bottom left edge.\n        *   (8, 1): Distance 7 (Right 5, Down 1). Bottom right.\n    *   **Long-term Plan:**\n        *   The bottom-left corner (x<3, y<3) is a potential trap. While apples are there ((1,0), (0,1)), diving deep into the corner early in the game can be dangerous if the enemy (currently at x=6) decides to cut off the exit or if I get stuck against the wall.\n        *   The enemy is on the right side (x=6). The left side is relatively open for me.\n        *   Moving UP to (3, 3) positions me centrally and vertically aligned with the apple at (2, 5).\n        *   Moving RIGHT to (4, 2) moves me towards the center/right where the enemy is, which might lead to early conflict.\n        *   Moving LEFT to (2, 2) moves me directly towards the left-side apples but keeps me low (y=2).\n\n5.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP (3, 3):** Safe. Opens up vertical mobility. Brings me closer to the central cluster of apples (e.g., (3,4), (4,5), (4,9)). Keeps me out of the bottom-left corner for now.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 2):** Safe. Moves me closer to (2, 5) and the bottom-left apples. Lowers my y-coordinate, potentially limiting upward escape routes if the enemy pushes down from the top.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 2):** Safe. Moves me towards the center. However, the enemy is on the right side. Engaging too early might be risky.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 1):** Safe but backward. Avoid unless necessary.\n\n6.  **Decision:**\n    *   I prefer **UP**. It keeps my vertical options open, moves away from the immediate bottom edge (where I started), and positions me for a turn toward the apple at (2, 5) or central apples next turn. It avoids moving directly toward the enemy (Right) and avoids diving into the corner (Left) prematurely.\n\n    **Proposed Move:** UP\n\n    **Long-term Plan:** Move UP towards the center. On the next turn, consider moving LEFT to (2, 3) or (2, 4) to align with the apple at (2, 5) or head towards (3, 4). Monitor the enemy snake's movement; if they head down, I should maintain distance.\n\nUP",

Body: [(3, 4)].\n    *   **Self-Collision Risk:** The cell (3, 4) is now occupied by my own body. Moving DOWN (to 3, 4) would be fatal. This leaves UP, LEFT, and RIGHT as valid directional moves.\n    *   **Growth Status:** I moved UP from (3, 4) to (3, 5). I ate the apple at (3, 5). My body will grow after this turn, extending my tail at (3, 4). (Note: Based on standard snake rules, the tail remains in place until the next move, so currently (3, 4) is the only tail segment).\n\n2.  **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 head at (8, 9). Body: [(7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7)].\n    *   **Analysis:** The enemy is at the very top-right. They are likely chasing the apple at (9, 2) or (8, 1), but they have a long body trailing down. They are currently not a threat to my immediate vicinity.\n\n3.  **Board State Analysis (Coordinates around Head (3, 5)):**\n    *   **UP (3, 6):** Based on the visual grid, Row 6 is mostly empty (dots). The character at (3, 6) is a dot. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT (2, 5):** The grid shows 'A' at (2, 5). **Safe (Apple).**\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 5):** The grid shows 'A' at (4, 5). **Safe (Apple).**\n    *   **DOWN (3, 4):** This is my current tail position. Moving here is suicide. **Fatal.**\n\n4.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **LEFT (2, 5):** Moves to an apple. Increases score. Safe. However, this moves me into the left quarter of the board, closer to the wall (x=0) and potentially boxing myself in if the enemy moves aggressively to the center.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 5):** Moves to an apple. Increases score. Safe. This moves me to the right, but keeps me in the center lane (x=4). This maintains more options than LEFT. However, it brings me slightly closer to the enemy's current activity zone (x=8-9), though still far enough away to be safe for a few turns.\n    *   **UP (3, 6):** Moves to an empty cell. Does not get an apple immediately. Safe. Preserves the apples at (2, 5) and (4, 5) for the next turn, but risks the enemy coming closer (unlikely from y=9) or leaving the cluster.\n\n5.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   My primary goal is to collect apples to surpass the enemy (1 vs 4).\n    *   The apples at (2, 5) and (4, 5) are both adjacent to my head. I must choose one.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 5)** is superior to LEFT (2, 5) because it keeps me closer to the center. The board is 10x10; staying central provides more maneuverability and escape routes. Moving LEFT forces me against the wall at x=0 eventually.\n    *   By moving RIGHT, I eat an apple, extend my length (making it harder for the enemy to kill me by hitting my body), and maintain a central position to pivot towards other apple clusters (e.g., (7, 4), (1, 3)) next turn.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Eat the apple at (4, 5) by moving RIGHT. This scores a point and keeps strategic options open.\n\n**Proposed Move:** RIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

My body remains [(3, 5), (3, 4)] for the purpose of collision on this turn. (Note: In standard snake, the tail stays to allow growth; in some variants, it moves immediately. Given the visual grid from the previous turn, the tail was not removed, so I assume the tail remains fixed this turn).\n    *   **Self-Collision Risk:** The cells (3, 5) (behind me) and (3, 4) (my tail) are occupied.\n\n2.  **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 Head at (8, 8). Body: [(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8)].\n    *   **Movement Prediction:** The enemy is at the top right. Apples near them are (9, 2) and (8, 1). The closest visible apple is (7, 6) or (8, 5). Given their position, they might move DOWN or try to sweep the perimeter. However, they are currently far enough (distance > 4) that direct collision is unlikely *this turn* unless they specifically target my coordinates, which is improbable given the board state.\n\n3.  **Board State Analysis (Coordinates around Head (4, 5)):**\n    *   **Visual Grid Interpretation (Based on previous state):**\n        *   **UP (4, 6):** Row 6 is empty (dots). Safe.\n        *   **DOWN (4, 4):** Row 4 contains a 'T' (Trap/Wall?) or perhaps an apple? The provided key includes 'T' for Trap. However, looking at the grid:\n            ```\n            9 . . . . A A A T T .\n            8 . . A A . . T T 1 .\n            ...\n            5 . . A T 0 . . . A .\n            4 . . . T . . . A . .\n            ```\n            At (4, 4), the grid shows 'T'. **T is a Trap.** Moving into a Trap is fatal. **DOWN is DEATH.**\n        *   **LEFT (3, 5):** This was my previous head position. My body is currently there. **LEFT is DEATH.**\n        *   **RIGHT (5, 5):** The grid at (5, 5) is a dot ('.'). Safe.\n\n4.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP (4, 6):** Safe. Opens up the top half of the board. However, if I go UP, I might be moving away from the dense apple clusters at (1, 3) and (7, 4).\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 5):** Safe. Moves me horizontally. I am currently at x=4. The \"Trap\" at (4, 4) suggests the center is dangerous or restricted. Moving RIGHT keeps me at y=5.\n    *   **DOWN (4, 4):** **Fatal (Trap).**\n    *   **LEFT (3, 5):** **Fatal (Self).**\n\n5.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   **Constraint:** I cannot go DOWN (Trap) or LEFT (Self).\n    *   **Option A (UP):** Moves to (4, 6). This is safe but puts me directly in the vertical line of the Trap at (4, 4). If I need to go down later, I might have to detour.\n    *   **Option B (RIGHT):** Moves to (5, 5). This is safe.\n    *   **Comparison:** The Trap at (4, 4) implies that the column x=4 is compromised downwards. By moving RIGHT to (5, 5), I exit the compromised column. This increases my distance from the Trap.\n    *   **Apple Targeting:** There is an apple at (6, 9) in the top right. There is also an apple at (5, 9). Moving RIGHT positions me closer to these apples (increasing x towards 6, 9) and also keeps me in range of the apple at (7, 4) if I decide to loop back.\n    *   **Enemy Safety:** Moving RIGHT keeps me at a safe distance from Snake #1 at (8, 8).\n\n    *   **Final Choice:** Moving RIGHT is the safer option. It avoids the Trap in the current column and positions me to move towards the upper-right apples (6, 9) or (5, 9), which seem less contested than the cluster near the enemy's starting area.\n\n**Proposed Move:** RIGHT",

While there is an apple at (7, 4), moving right brings me closer to the enemy's current position and body at (8, 8).\n    *   **DOWN/LEFT:** Fatal.\n\n5.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   The trap at (4, 4) and (5, 4) blocks the bottom area. Moving UP to (5, 6) is the better choice. It keeps me in the \"safe\" vertical corridor (x=5) while moving away from the traps.\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (6, 5) is tempting because of the apple at (7, 4), but it brings me closer to the enemy snake's territory. Since the enemy is winning (4 apples vs 2), I should prioritize safety and board control over risky apple grabs.\n    *   Moving UP allows me to access the top row apples (5, 9) or (6, 9) eventually, or pivot left to (4, 6) and then (3, 6) to reach the left-side apples.\n    *   Based on my Long-Term Plan, I intend to reach (4, 6). To do that, I should move UP to (5, 6) or UP-LEFT (which isn't an option this turn). Moving UP to (5, 6) sets me up to move LEFT to (4, 6) next turn. This is a safe maneuver.\n\n**Proposed Move:** UP\n\nUP",

This is close to the apple at (1,3) (down 2) and (1,1) (down 4). It keeps me in the left side of the board where apples are more dense (bottom-left has apples at (0,1), (1,0), (1,3), (1,1)? Actually (1,3) is an apple. (1,1) is empty? No, row 1 is `A . . . . . . A A .`. (1,1) is '.'. (1,3) is 'A'. Moving LEFT puts me closer to (1,3).\n        *   **UP (2,6):** Row 6 is ` . . . . T . . T T . . `. (2,6) is empty. (2,7) is empty? Row 7 is ` . . . . A . . T T . `. (2,7) is empty. Moving UP goes towards the top. There are apples at (2,8) and (4,9), (5,9), (6,9). This is a valid path but requires more turns to reach apples.\n        *   **DOWN (2,4):** (2,4) is empty. (2,3) is empty? Row 3 is ` . A . . . . . . . A `. (2,3) is empty. (2,2) is empty. (2,1) is ` . . . . . . . A A . ` (2,1) is empty. (2,0) is ` . A . . . . . . A . ` (2,0) is empty. Going DOWN seems to lead into a relatively open area but with fewer immediate apples compared to going LEFT towards the (1,3) apple or UP towards the top-right cluster.\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   LEFT moves towards the (1,3) apple. It also reduces my x coordinate, which is generally good to avoid the enemy on the right side.\n        *   UP moves towards (2,8) and the top apples.\n        *   DOWN moves into open space with no immediate apples visible in the direct path (apples are at (1,0), (4,0) etc, but (2,0) is empty).\n\n    *   **Safety Check:**\n        *   LEFT (1,5): Open.\n        *   UP (2,6): Open.\n        *   DOWN (2,4): Open.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** LEFT is a strong move because it heads towards an apple (1,3) and keeps me in the \"safe\" zone away from the enemy. UP is also good but leads to a longer journey to the nearest apple (2,8) which is 3 moves away. LEFT gets me closer to (1,3) (2 moves away).\n\n    *   **Final Check:** Is (1,5) occupied by anything? Map says no. Is it occupied by enemy movement? No, enemy is at 7,5.\n    \n    *   Let's reconsider UP. The apple at (2,8) is 3 moves away. The apple at (1,3) is 2 moves away. LEFT seems better for short-term gain.\n    \n    *   Wait, looking at the board again.\n        Row 5 (y=5) at x=1 is empty.\n        Row 6 (y=6) at x=1 is empty.\n        Row 6 (y=6) at x=2 is empty.\n        \n        If I go LEFT to (1,5):\n        Next turn I can go DOWN to (1,4) -> (1,3) [Apple].\n        \n        If I go UP to (2,6):\n        Next turn I can go UP to (2,7) -> (2,8) [Apple].\n        \n        Both are valid. However, the (1,3) apple is closer.\n        \n        One specific threat: The enemy snake is long. If the enemy turns up or left, could it block me? No, it's too far.\n        \n        Let's look at the (1,0) apple. (1,0) is a valid apple. (1,0) is down-left.\n        Path: (2,5) -> (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) [Apple] -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) [Apple].\n        This is a solid path.\n        \n        Alternative path via UP:\n        (2,5) -> (2,6) -> (2,7) -> (2,8) [Apple] -> (3,8) -> (4,9) [Apple].\n        \n        The bottom-left path seems safer and less contested. The enemy is at (7,5), looking towards the bottom-right (apples at 8,1 etc) or top-right (apples at 9,2, 9,3, 6,9, etc).\n        \n        So, LEFT is the strategic choice.\n\n**Proposed Move:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

My head is now closer to the bottom-left cluster of apples ((1,3), (1,0), (0,1)). I need to move DOWN to (1,4) to proceed. I must be wary of the enemy snake who is in the center-right. Avoid the right side.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**Analysis of Current State (Turn 15):**\n1.  **My Position:** Head at (1,5). Body: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5)].\n    *   *Turn 14/150 Calculation Recap:* Previous head was (2,5). I moved LEFT. New head is (1,5).\n    *   *Body update:* The tail [(4,5)] moved to (3,5). The segment (3,5) moved to (2,5). The segment (4,5) moved to (3,5)? No, that's not how it works.\n    *   Let's trace the body movement precisely based on the move LEFT from (2,5).\n    *   Start of Turn 14: Head (2,5), Body [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6)].\n    *   Move: LEFT to (1,5).\n    *   New Body order: The old head becomes the first body segment. The old body shifts down.\n    *   New Head: (1,5)\n    *   New Body Segment 1: (2,5) (Old Head)\n    *   New Body Segment 2: (3,5) (Old Body Segment 1)\n    *   New Body Segment 3: (4,5) (Old Body Segment 2)\n    *   Wait, the prompt for Turn 15 says:\n        \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (1,5), Body: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\"\n    *   This matches my prediction. (4,6) was the tail, which effectively disappeared (did not exist in the provided state for turn 15). The prompt's provided state is the ground truth. I will trust the prompt's state over my manual simulation for the exact body list, but the logic holds.\n\n2.  **Board State Inspection around Head (1,5):**\n    *   Map Row 5 (y=5): ` . . 0 T T . . 1 T . . ` (Visualizing the prompt's map)\n        *   x=0: '.'\n        *   x=1: '0' (My Head)\n        *   x=2: 'T' (My Body)\n        *   x=3: 'T' (My Body)\n        *   x=4: 'T' (My Body) -> Wait, the prompt says my body is [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]. The map shows 'T' at (4,5). Correct.\n        *   x=5: '.'\n        *   x=6: '.'\n        *   x=7: '1' (Enemy Head)\n        *   x=8: 'T' (Enemy Body)\n        *   x=9: '.'\n\n    *   **Move Options:**\n        *   **RIGHT (2, 5):** **FATAL.** My own body segment is at (2,5).\n        *   **LEFT (0, 5):** Map Row 5, x=0 is '.'. Is it inside the board? Yes, x=0..9. Is it a wall? No. This is safe.\n        *   **UP (1, 6):** Map Row 6 (y=6): ` . . . . T . . T T . . `\n            *   x=1 (Col 1) is '.'.\n            *   Safe.\n        *   **DOWN (1, 4):** Map Row 4 (y=4): ` . . . . . . . A . . `\n            *   x=1 (Col 1) is '.'.\n            *   Safe.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT (0, 5):** Moves to the wall column. This is a \"dead end\" strategic move. Once at (0,5), next moves are limited to UP/DOWN (or RIGHT back to (1,5) which will be occupied by my own body). While (0,5) is safe now, it reduces future maneuvering space. I should avoid the wall unless necessary.\n    *   **UP (1, 6):** Moves towards the top-right apples. This is a viable strategy, but the enemy is currently at (7,4). If I go UP, I move away from the immediate apple at (1,3).\n    *   **DOWN (1, 4):** Moves towards the apple at (1,3). This is the planned path.\n        *   Target: (1,3) [Apple]\n        *   Path: (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (1,3).\n        *   Safety check for (1,4):\n            *   (1,4) is empty.\n            *   Enemy is at (7,4). They are far away.\n            *   No immediate collision risk.\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   **Objective:** Eat apples to catch up (Snake #1 has 7, I have 3).\n    *   **Priority:** Safety > Apple proximity.\n    *   **Analysis:**\n        *   **LEFT** is dangerous strategically (dead end).\n        *   **UP** moves away from the nearest apple (1,3) and towards (2,8) (3 moves away). It also moves into the area where the enemy might eventually go.\n        *   **DOWN** moves towards the nearest apple (1,3) (1 move away after this turn). It is safe.\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Snake #1 is at (7,4). They are likely chasing the bottom-right apples ((8,1), (9,2), (9,3)). They are moving away from me. Collision is unlikely.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** DOWN is the optimal move. It progresses towards the goal ((1,3) apple) and maintains safety.\n\n**Proposed Move:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

The cluster around (0,1) and (1,0) looks promising if accessible.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**Analysis of Current State (Turn 16):**\n1.  **Update Previous Move:** I last moved DOWN from (1,5) to (1,4).\n    *   Old Head: (1,5).\n    *   New Head: (1,4).\n    *   Old Body: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5)].\n    *   New Body: The tail [(3,5)] dropped off. The old head (1,5) becomes the first body segment. The other segments shifted.\n    *   New Body List: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5)].\n    *   My current state (Head (1,4), Body [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]) matches the input state. Good.\n\n2.  **Current Board State Inspection (Head at (1,4)):**\n    *   The prompt's board state shows the current situation. My head is at (1,4) ('0').\n    *   My body is at (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) ('T's).\n    *   Enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) ('1') with body parts scattered in the center-right.\n\n3.  **Move Options:**\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 4):** Map Row 4 (y=4): ` . . . . . . . T . . `. x=2 is '.'.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 4):** Map Row 4, x=0 is '.'.\n    *   **UP (1, 5):** Map Row 5 (y=5): ` . . 0 T T . . 1 T . . `. x=1 (y=5) is 'T' (my own body: (1,5)). **FATAL.**\n    *   **DOWN (1, 3):** Map Row 3 (y=3): ` . A . . . . . 1 . A `. x=1 is 'A' (Apple).\n\n4.  **Safety Analysis:**\n    *   **UP** hits my own body segment at (1,5). Immediate death. Eliminated.\n    *   **LEFT** to (0,4) is safe (empty). However, (0,4) is against the wall. This limits future moves to UP (to (0,5) which is empty) or DOWN (to (0,3) which is 'A'), but RIGHT leads back to (1,4) which will be occupied by my body. It's a bit of a trap unless I eat.\n    *   **RIGHT** to (2,4) is safe (empty). It moves me away from the bottom-left apples.\n    *   **DOWN** to (1,3) is safe (Apple). It gains an apple.\n\n5.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** There is an apple directly below me at (1,3). This is the closest apple.\n    *   **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (7,3). They are currently at the same Y-coordinate (3) but at X=7. They are not an immediate threat to (1,3).\n    *   **Growth:** Eating an apple increases my length, which is generally good for survival and score. I have 3 apples; Snake #1 has 7. I need to catch up.\n    *   **Dead Ends:**\n        *   If I go LEFT to (0,4), I am on the wall. If I don't eat immediately, I might be forced into a corner. If I go DOWN from (0,4) to (0,3) (Apple), I am at (0,3) on the wall. Future moves from there are limited (Right to (1,3), Up to (0,4)). This is a potential trap if I don't have space.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (2,4), I am moving away from the cluster of apples at (1,0), (0,1), (0,2). I am also moving towards the center where the enemy is.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (1,3), I eat an apple. My tail will move from (3,5) to (2,5) (assuming no growth logic for the *next* turn's body calc, but for *this* turn's survival check, the tail doesn't matter). Wait, when I eat, I grow. The tail *does not* move this turn.\n            *   Current Body: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5)].\n            *   Move: DOWN to (1,3).\n            *   New Head: (1,3).\n            *   New Body: The old head (1,4) becomes body segment 1. The old body segments shift. The tail (3,5) *stays* because I grew.\n            *   New Body: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)].\n            *   Check safety: (1,3) is Apple. (1,4) is now body. (1,5) is body. (2,5) is body. (3,5) is body.\n            *   Is (1,3) safe? Yes.\n            *   Is (1,2) safe for the *next* turn? (1,2) is '.'.\n            *   Is (0,3) safe for the *next* turn? (0,3) is 'A'.\n            *   Is (2,3) safe for the *next* turn? (2,3) is '.'.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **DOWN** gives me an apple immediately. It positions me at (1,3). From there, I can go to (1,2), (0,3) (Apple), or (2,3). This keeps options open to the bottom-left cluster.\n        *   **LEFT** keeps me at (0,4). No apple immediately.\n        *   **RIGHT** keeps me at (2,4). No apple immediately.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** DOWN is the optimal move. It secures an apple, increases my score (closing the gap to Snake #1), and keeps me in a position with reasonable future mobility. The immediate safety is confirmed (no wall, no self, no enemy body).\n\n**Proposed Move:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

If I go DOWN to (0,2), I am at (0,2) (Apple). From (0,2), I can go DOWN to (0,1) (Apple) or RIGHT to (1,2). This path leads to a cluster of apples without immediately trapping myself, provided I don't get stuck on the wall.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (2,3), I am moving away from the cluster of apples at (0,1), (1,0), (0,2). I am moving towards the center where the enemy is. This seems less optimal for immediate growth and score catching.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (1,2), I am moving towards the apples at (1,0) and (0,1).

There is an apple at (0,2) immediately below me. I am currently on the left wall (x=0). I must avoid moving UP into my own body at (0,4) if it is occupied, or moving into the wall (which is fatal). The enemy snake #1 is far to the right. I need to collect apples efficiently to catch up. I see a cluster of apples at (0,1) and (1,0) in the bottom-left corner. Moving DOWN to (0,2) is the priority to eat the apple there. From (0,2), I can then move DOWN to (0,1) or RIGHT to (1,2) to continue foraging.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**Analysis of Current State (Turn 18):**\n1.  **Update Previous Move:** I last moved LEFT from (1,3) to (0,3).\n    *   Old Head: (1,3).\n    *   New Head: (0,3) (Apple).\n    *   Old Body: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)].\n    *   New Body: Since I ate, I did not drop a tail. The old head (1,3) becomes body segment 1. The tail (3,5) remains.\n    *   New Body List: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)].\n    *   My current state (Head (0,3), Body [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]) matches the input state. Good.\n\n2.  **Current Board State Inspection (Head at (0,3)):**\n    *   My head is at (0,3) ('0').\n    *   My body is at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ('T's).\n    *   Enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) ('1').\n\n3.  **Move Options:**\n    *   **UP (0, 4):** Map Row 4 (y=4): ` . . . . . . . T . . `. x=0 is '.' (Empty).\n    *   **LEFT (0, 3):** Wall (x=-1). Fatal.\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 3):** Map Row 3 (y=3), x=1 is 'T' (My own body: (1,3)). Fatal.\n    *   **DOWN (0, 2):** Map Row 2 (y=2): ` A . . . . . . 1 . A `. x=0 is 'A' (Apple).\n\n4.  **Safety Analysis:**\n    *   **LEFT** is off-board. Immediate death. Eliminated.\n    *   **RIGHT** hits my own body segment at (1,3). Immediate death. Eliminated.\n    *   **UP** to (0,4) is safe (Empty).\n    *   **DOWN** to (0,2) is safe (Apple).\n\n5.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** There is an apple directly below at (0,2). There are also apples at (0,1) and (1,0) nearby. There is an apple at (0,4) above, but moving there leaves me further from the tight cluster at the bottom-left.\n    *   **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (7,3). They are far away and not an immediate threat to (0,2).\n    *   **Growth:** Eating an apple increases my length. I need to close the gap with Snake #1 (currently 4 vs 8 apples).\n    *   **Dead Ends & Future Options:**\n        *   **DOWN to (0,2):** This is the most promising move.\n            *   It eats an apple immediately.\n            *   From (0,2), I will have access to (0,1) (Apple) and (1,2) (Empty).\n            *   This path leads directly to the apple cluster at (0,1) and (1,0).\n            *   While being on the wall restricts horizontal movement, the immediate reward and the subsequent path to more apples make this the best choice.\n        *   **UP to (0,4):**\n            *   Safe, but moves me away from the dense apple cluster at the bottom-left.\n            *   The only apple immediately accessible after (0,4) is (0,5) or (1,4), but (1,4) is my body.\n            *   This route is less optimal for score accumulation and places me in a less dense apple area.\n    *   **Conclusion:** DOWN is the superior move. It secures an apple immediately, increases my score (bringing me to 5), and positions me to grab the next apple at (0,1) in the following turn. The immediate safety is confirmed (no wall, no self, no enemy body).\n\n**Proposed Move:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

I am currently safe to move DOWN. Snake #1 is unlikely to move to (0,1) or (0,0) in one turn given its distance and body length.\n\n**Proposed Move:** DOWN\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules and win conditions:\n- All snakes move simultaneously each turn.\n- Each turn, you choose one move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Every snake's head moves one cell in its chosen direction at the same time.\n- If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\n- If you move outside the board (beyond the listed coordinate ranges), you die.\n- If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\n- Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\n- If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\n- If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\n- If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins; if apples are tied, the game is a draw.\n- The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 30 apples. If multiple snakes reach 30 or more on the same turn, the snake with the higher apple count wins that round; if tied, it is a draw.\n- The game lasts at most 150 turns.\n- If at any point all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\n- If multiple snakes are still alive at the final turn, the snake with the most apples wins. If apples are tied at the end of the game, the game is a draw.\n\nObjective and strategy:\n- You cannot win if you are dead, so never choose a move that obviously kills you.\n- Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and\n  * keep future options open (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends).\n\nDecision process for each move:\n1) Consider all four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) Eliminate any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body).\n3) Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available and move you closer to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions (remember enemy heads will also move this turn).\n\nYou may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\nYou may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\nCoordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right. Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nThe final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.",

I need to start eating apples aggressively to catch up. From (1,2), the immediate target is the apple at (1,0). I must be careful of the enemy snake at (8,1) and the board boundaries.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**Analysis of Current State (Turn 20):**\n1.  **Update Previous Move:** I last moved RIGHT from (0,2) to (1,2).\n    *   Old Head: (0,2).\n    *   New Head: (1,2).\n    *   Old Body: [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)].\n    *   New Body: Since I didn't eat, the tail (2,5) is dropped. Old head becomes body. The new body is [(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)].\n    *   My current state (Head (1,2), Body [(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]) matches the input state (Head (1,2), Body [(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]). Good.\n\n2.  **Current Board State Inspection (Head at (1,2)):**\n    *   My head is at (1,2) ('0').\n    *   My body is at (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ('T's).\n    *   Enemy snake #1 is at (8,1) ('1').\n\n3.  **Move Options:**\n    *   **UP (1, 3):** Map Row 3 (y=3): ` . . . . . . . T . A `. x=1 is '.' (Empty).\n    *   **LEFT (0, 2):** Map Row 2 (y=2), x=0 is 'T' (My own body: (0,2)). Fatal (Backwards into self).\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 2):** Map Row 2 (y=2), x=2 is '.' (Empty).\n    *   **DOWN (1, 1):** Map Row 1 (y=1): ` A . . . . . . T 1 . `. x=1 is '.' (Empty).\n\n4.  **Safety Analysis:**\n    *   **LEFT** hits my own body segment at (0,2). Immediate death. Eliminated.\n    *   **UP** to (1,3) is safe (Empty).\n    *   **RIGHT** to (2,2) is safe (Empty).\n    *   **DOWN** to (1,1) is safe (Empty).\n\n5.  **Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** The closest apples are at (0,1), (1,0), and (2,8). (0,1) is Left/Down from here. (1,0) is Down. (2,8) is far Right/Up.\n    *   **Dead Ends & Future Options:**\n        *   **UP to (1,3):** From (1,3), I can go UP to (1,4) (Body), LEFT to (0,3) (Body), RIGHT to (2,3) (Empty). This limits me to moving Right. Not ideal for reaching (1,0).\n        *   **RIGHT to (2,2):** From (2,2), I can go UP to (2,3), DOWN to (2,1), LEFT to (1,2) (My previous head), or RIGHT to (3,2). This offers horizontal mobility but moves me away from the immediate apple cluster at (0,1)/(1,0).\n        *   **DOWN to (1,1):** This is the most promising move.\n            *   From (1,1), I can go DOWN to (1,0) (Apple).\n            *   From (1,1), I can go LEFT to (0,1) (Apple).\n            *   From (1,1), I can go RIGHT to (2,1) (Empty).\n            *   This move positions me perfectly to collect the apples at (0,1) and (1,0) in the next two turns.\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Snake #1 is at (8,1). With 10 apples, they are growing long. They are likely focused on the apples on the right side of the board (e.g., (9,2), (9,3), (8,9)). They are not an immediate threat to my position on the left side.\n\n**Proposed Move:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

After eating, I will target the cluster of apples on the top right or center to continue scoring aggressively.\nEND LONG-TERM PLAN\n\n1. **Analyze Current Position:** My head is at (1,1). My body is at [(1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4)].\n2. **Check Surroundings for Safety:**\n   *   **UP (1,2):** Occupied by my own body (the segment immediately following my head). This is a direct backward move into self. **FATAL**.\n   *   **LEFT (0,1):** Empty (contains an apple). Safe.\n   *   **RIGHT (2,1):** Empty. Safe.\n   *   **DOWN (1,0):** Empty (contains an apple). Safe.\n3. **Strategic Evaluation:**\n   *   The primary objective is to eat an apple to increase my score (currently 5 vs enemy 10).\n   *   **Target (1,0):** This apple is directly below me. Eating it is the most efficient move. It also leaves me with options to move to (0,0) or (2,0) next turn, keeping me mobile.\n   *   **Target (0,1):** Eating this moves me to the edge. From (0,1), my only safe forward moves would be (0,0) or (1,1) (which will be occupied by my body by then). While possible, (1,0) feels slightly more open for future pathing.\n   *   **Moving Right/Up:** These moves delay apple consumption. Given the score gap, I need to eat consistently.\n4. **Enemy Consideration:** Snake #1 is at (9,0). They are far away and not a collision threat this turn.\n5. **Conclusion:** Moving DOWN to (1,0) is safe, scores a point, and maintains good board position. Moving UP is suicide.

From (1,0), moving LEFT to (0,0) leads to a dead end (only exit is back to (1,0) which will be occupied by my body). Moving UP to (1,1) is blocked by my own body (the segment at (1,1)). Moving RIGHT to (2,0) is the only open path that keeps me mobile. From (2,0), I can target the apple at (0,1) or (4,4) while maintaining an escape route. I must also keep an eye on Snake #1 in the top right; if he heads down the right side, I may need to secure the top-left cluster (0,1) and (3,8) quickly.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n1.  **Analyze Current Position:** My head is at (1, 0). My body is at [(1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 0) - (1, 1) is directly above me.\n2.  **Check Surroundings for Safety:**\n    *   **UP (1, 1):** Occupied by my own body (the segment immediately following my head). This is a direct backward move into self. **FATAL**.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 0):** Empty (border of the board). Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 0):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (1, -1):** Outside the board. **FATAL**.\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Safety Check:** I cannot move UP or DOWN. My only legal moves are LEFT or RIGHT.\n    *   **Left (0, 0):** This places me at the very corner of the board. Looking at the map, from (0, 0), the only adjacent cell inside the board is (1, 0) (RIGHT). However, by the time I make my next move, (1, 0) will be occupied by my body (the tail currently at (1, 0) will shift, but the body segment at (1, 1) will move into (1, 0)). Effectively, moving LEFT to (0, 0) creates a trap where my only exit is blocked by my own body. This is a \"dead end\" that will likely kill me in the subsequent turn. While not immediately fatal, it is a poor strategic move that leads to almost certain death.\n    *   **Right (2, 0):** This is an open cell. It keeps me mobile and leaves me with multiple forward paths (UP to (2, 1), LEFT to (1, 0), RIGHT to (3, 0)). This preserves my survival options.\n    *   **Long-term Vision:** The apple at (0, 1) is attractive, but I can reach it later from (2, 0) via (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1) (if the path is clear) or other routes. Immediate survival and board control take precedence over a single apple that leads to a corner.\n4.  **Enemy Consideration:** Snake #1 is at (9, 1) and moving towards the top right apples. They are not an immediate threat to my position in the bottom left.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Moving LEFT is a trap. Moving RIGHT is the only safe move that maintains future options. I must choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Moving there is safe because my tail will move away before my head arrives. UP to (2, 1) is empty and safe. LEFT to (1, 0) is safe but leads back into my body as it shifts. DOWN is out of bounds.\nGiven the enemy snake's position and direction (likely heading for apples at (9, 3) and (9, 7)), and the board state, I should prioritize securing the bottom-right area and the central apples like (4, 4) and (4, 7). The apple at (9, 3) is in enemy territory, but (4, 4) is a good mid-term target. From (2, 0), moving RIGHT or UP are both good. Moving UP to (2, 1) keeps me closer to the left-side apples (0, 1) and (3, 8) while opening the path up the left side. Moving RIGHT to (3, 0) moves me towards the center but leaves me somewhat constricted in the bottom row. Let's look at the connectivity.\nPath to (4, 4): (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4).\nPath to (0, 1): (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).\nPath to (3, 8): (2,0) -> (2,1) -> ... -> (3,8).\nMoving UP seems to offer better strategic positioning for the left-center apples. Let's verify safety.\nIf I move UP to (2, 1):\n- Is it on the board? Yes.\n- Is it my body? The body is at [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3)]. (2, 1) is not in this list. Safe.\n- Is it enemy body? Enemy is at [(9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)]. Safe.\n- Will I collide with enemy head? Enemy head is at (9, 2). He will likely move UP to (9, 3) or LEFT to (8, 2). (2, 1) is far away. Safe.\nMoving UP is the most versatile move.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**RATIONALE**\nCurrent head: (2, 0).\nMy body segments: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3).\nEnemy head: (9, 2). Enemy body covers much of the right side.\nAvailable moves from (2, 0):\n1. **UP to (2, 1):** Empty. Safe from self. Safe from enemy.\n2. **LEFT to (1, 0):** Occupied by my current body (the neck). Moving here is fatal (backward move).\n3. **RIGHT to (3, 0):** Currently occupied by my tail (1, 0)? No, wait. My tail is at (1, 0)? No, the list is head-to-tail.\nHead: (2, 0).\nBody: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3).\nWait, the body list provided is: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3)].\nSo the segment at (1, 0) is the one immediately behind the head.\nMoving LEFT to (1, 0) is moving into my own body. **FATAL**.\nMoving DOWN to (2, -1) is off the board. **FATAL**.\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 0): Is it safe?\nIs (3, 0) in my body list? No.\nIs (3, 0) in enemy body list? No (Enemy is on right side).\nSo (3, 0) is a valid empty square.\nHowever, if I move RIGHT to (3, 0), my body shifts.\nNew tail would be (1, 3).\nIs (3, 0) safe regarding my own tail movement?\nWhen I move to (3, 0), the tail at (1, 3) moves to (0, 3), etc.\nThe segment currently at (1, 0) (my neck) moves to (2, 0) (my old spot).\nSo (3, 0) is definitely empty for my head to move into.\nHowever, moving to (3, 0) puts me on the bottom row. The bottom row is (0,0) to (9,0).\nMy body currently occupies (1, 0) and will move to (2, 0).\nIf I am at (3, 0), my next moves might be restricted.\nLet's look at moving UP to (2, 1).\n(2, 1) is empty.\nFrom (2, 1), I can go to (2, 2), (3, 1), (1, 1).\n(1, 1) is currently occupied by my body. By the time I am at (2, 1), (1, 1) will have shifted (it's the 2nd body segment).\nIf I move UP to (2, 1):\n- My body moves: (1, 0) -> (2, 0), (1, 1) -> (1, 0), (1, 2) -> (1, 1), etc.\n- So (1, 1) becomes empty in the next turn (it moves to 1, 0).\nSo (2, 1) is safe.\nComparing (2, 1) vs (3, 0):\n(2, 1) is central bottom. (3, 0) is bottom edge.\n(2, 1) is generally better because it has more exit routes (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN).\n(3, 0) has LEFT, RIGHT, UP. (DOWN is out).\nSince (1, 0) is a fatal move, we eliminate that.\n(2, 1) seems like the most strategic move to open up the board and target the apples at (4, 4) or (0, 1).\nLet's double check the apples.\nApples at (4, 4), (4, 2), (0, 1).\nFrom (2, 1):\n- To (0, 1): Distance 2.\n- To (4, 2): Distance ~3.\n- To (4, 4): Distance ~4.\nFrom (3, 0):\n- To (4, 2): Distance 3.\n- To (4, 4): Distance 5.\n- To (0, 1): Distance 4.\n(2, 1) is closer to the left-side apples and central apples.\nAlso, looking at the enemy snake (ID 1) at (9, 2).\nHe has 11 apples. I have 6.\nHe is on the right side.\nIf I go UP to (2, 1), I can control the left side and center.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 0), I am moving towards the center but staying low.\n(2, 1) seems safer and more flexible.\nLet's confirm \"BACKWARDS\" rule.\nMy head is (2, 0). Previous head was (1, 0) (implied by body list).\nMoving to (1, 0) is backwards. Correct, fatal.\nMoving UP to (2, 1) is not backwards.\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 0) is not backwards.\nI will choose UP.\n**RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nUP\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**",

          "rationale": "**Current State Analysis**\nMy head is at (2, 1). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (9, 3) with a long body occupying the right side of the board. I have 6 apples, and the enemy has 12. I need to catch up while ensuring I don't die.\n\n**Moves from (2, 1):**\n1.  **UP (2, 2):** Currently empty (based on board state: row 2 has T at x=0,1, A at x=4, T at x=9). Safe from immediate collision. However, checking the enemy's potential moves is critical. The enemy is at (9, 3). If the enemy moves DOWN, it goes to (9, 2). (9, 2) is currently occupied by the enemy's body (segment index 8). **Crucially, if the enemy moves DOWN into its own body, it dies.** Since the enemy has 12 apples and likely wants to survive, moving DOWN is a suicidal move for the enemy. The enemy is more likely to move UP to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 3). Even if the enemy moves UP, its head lands on (9, 4), which is currently empty but surrounded by its own body. My position (2, 2) is far from the enemy. If the enemy moves LEFT to (8, 3), its head lands on (8, 3). (8, 3) is currently empty (row 3 has T at x=0,7,9 and Enemy Head at x=9). The enemy's body at (8, 3) will shift (the segment at (8, 3) moves to (8, 2)). So (8, 3) is a valid target for the enemy.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 0):** This cell was my previous head position. My body will shift, and this cell will become my neck. Moving back into the neck is fatal (backwards move).\n3.  **LEFT (1, 1):** My body currently occupies (1, 1). Moving there is fatal.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 1):** Currently empty. Safe from immediate collision.\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves (UP vs RIGHT):**\n*   **Targeting Apples:** There are apples at (4, 2), (4, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), etc.\n    *   Moving **UP (2, 2)** keeps me on the x=2 column, directly below the cluster of apples at (2, 6) and (2, 8). This is a clear path upwards on the left side.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT (3, 1)** moves me towards the center but away from the left-side apples.\n*   **Safety:**\n    *   **UP:** Moving to (2, 2) isolates me in the left-center. The enemy is on the far right. Even if the enemy survives a suicidal move and somehow rushes left (which is impossible in one turn), I am safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Moving to (3, 1) keeps me near the bottom. While safe now, it might force me into a corner later.\n*   **Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   The enemy is at (9, 3). Its only safe moves are UP to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 3). Moving DOWN kills it. Moving RIGHT kills it (out of bounds).\n    *   If the enemy moves UP to (9, 4), it is safe for now.\n    *   If the enemy moves LEFT to (8, 3), it is safe for now.\n    *   The enemy is unlikely to commit suicide by moving DOWN. However, if it does, it dies immediately, and I win.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** to (2, 2) is the best strategic choice. It aligns with my goal to secure the left-side apples ((2, 6), (2, 8)) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy. It also avoids the bottom-left area which is getting crowded with my own tail. Moving RIGHT is also safe but puts me closer to the center where the board is more open but where I might encounter the enemy later if he breaks out. Prioritizing the isolated left-side apples is safer and faster for point accumulation.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nSecure the left column apples ((2, 6), (2, 8)) to catch up in score. Avoid the right side where the enemy is dominant. Monitor the enemy to see if it makes a fatal error (moving into its own body).\n\nUP",

A . . . . . . .` -> (3, 6) is '.'.\n\nThe left side (x=2) seems safer because the enemy is definitely at x>=7.\nIf I go UP to (2, 3), I am strictly in the left zone.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 2), I am entering the \"no man's land\" or the center.\nThe apple at (4, 2) is at y=2.\nThe enemy body is at y=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on x=7, 8, 9.\nThe gap is x=5, 6.\nIf I go to (4, 2), I am at x=4.\nIf the enemy moves, it will stay on the right.\nThere is no immediate threat.\n\nHowever, let's look at the board state again.\nRow 2: `T T 0 . A . . T . T`\nMy tail is at (0, 2).\nIf I move UP to (2, 3):\nMy head (2, 2) moves to (2, 3).\nMy body shifts.\nNew tail at (0, 1)?\nMy current body: (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2).\nIf I move UP:\nNew body: (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2).\nOld tail (0, 2) becomes (0, 1) (Wait, the tail moves based on the list. The list shifts).\nThe last element (0, 2) is removed.\nThe new last element is (1, 2).\nSo the tail moves from (0, 2) to (1, 2).\nWait, my body list is [(2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2)].\nIf I move UP, new list is [(2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)].\nThe tail is at (1, 2).\nThe cell (0, 2) becomes empty.\n(0, 1) is currently 'T'. This is part of my body? No, my body at (0, 1) is not listed.\nWait, let's check the board state again.\nRow 1: `A T T . . . . T T T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0: A\n1: T\n2: T\n...\n7: T\n8: T\n9: T\nRow 2: `T T 0 . A . . T . T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0: T\n1: T\n2: 0\n\nSo (0, 1) is 'T'. Is this my body?\nMy body list: [(2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2)].\nWait, (0, 1) is not in my body list provided in the prompt.\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully.\n\"My snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (2, 2)\n  - Body: [(2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2)]\"\n\nSo (0, 1) is NOT my body.\nWait, the board state shows `T` at (0, 1) (Row 1, Index 0).\nIs that an error in the board rendering or my body list?\nMy body list has (0, 2).\n(0, 1) is adjacent to (0, 2).\nIt is highly likely that (0, 1) IS part of my body, and the list provided is truncated or simplified, or I am misinterpreting the coordinates.\nHowever, the prompt explicitly lists the body coordinates. I must trust the list.\nIf the list says my body is at (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1).\nThen (0, 1) is NOT my body.\nIf (0, 1) is not my body, but the board shows 'T', then it must be Enemy body or a rendering artifact.\nLet's check Enemy body.\nEnemy #1: Body at `[(9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5)]`.\n(0, 1) is not in Enemy body.\nSo (0, 1) is empty or a wall? No, it's a 'T' on the board.\nIf the board says 'T' and it's not in my body list and not in enemy body list...\nThere are only 2 snakes.\nWait, maybe the 'T' on the board at (0, 1) is a typo in the board state visualization?\nOr maybe my body list is wrong?\nLet's look at the board state provided:\n`0 . T T . . . . . T T`\nRow 0: Index 0 is '.', Index 1 is 'T', Index 2 is 'T'.\nWait, `0` is the row label? No, the coordinate range is (0,0) to (9,9).\nRow 0: ` . T T . . . . . T T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(0, 0) is '.'.\n(1, 0) is 'T'.\n(2, 0) is 'T'.\n(8, 0) is 'T'.\n(9, 0) is 'T'.\n\nMy body list: (2, 0), (1, 0).\nSo (1, 0) and (2, 0) are 'T'. Correct.\n(8, 0) and (9, 0) are 'T'. These are Enemy body.\nRow 1: `A T T . . . . T T T`\n(0, 1) is 'A'.\n(1, 1) is 'T'.\n(2, 1) is 'T'.\n(7, 1) is 'T'.\n(8, 1) is 'T'.\n(9, 1) is 'T'.\n\nMy body list: (1, 1), (2, 1). Correct.\nEnemy body: (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1). Correct.\n\nRow 2: `T T 0 . A . . T . T`\n(0, 2) is 'T'.\n(1, 2) is 'T'.\n(2, 2) is '0'.\n(7, 2) is 'T'.\n(9, 2) is 'T'.\n\nMy body list: (0, 2), (1, 2). Correct.\nEnemy body: (7, 2), (9, 2). Correct.\n\nSo the board state and body lists match perfectly.\n(0, 1) is 'A' (Apple), not 'T'.\nI misread the board.\nRow 1: `A T T ...`\nIndex 0 is 'A'.\nSo (0, 1) is an Apple.\nThere is an apple at (0, 1) listed in the prompt's apple list: \"Apples at: ... (0, 1) ...\"\nSo (0, 1) is safe (it's an apple).\nWait, if I move to (0, 1), I eat an apple.\nCan I move to (0, 1)?\nMy head is at (2, 2).\n(0, 1) is 2 steps away (LEFT -> DOWN or DOWN -> LEFT).\nI cannot reach it in one move.\nSo (0, 1) is irrelevant for *this* move.\n\nBack to UP vs RIGHT.\nApple at (4, 2) is 2 moves away (RIGHT -> RIGHT).\nApple at (2, 6) is 4 moves away (UP -> UP -> UP -> UP).\nApple at (2, 8) is 6 moves away.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 2):\nI am one step closer to (4, 2).\n(3, 2) is empty.\nIs there any danger?\nThe enemy is at (8, 3).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 3), it is safe (body at (8, 3)).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (8, 4), safe.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 2), safe (body at (9, 2)).\nThe enemy cannot reach me.\nMy only risk is hitting my own body.\nMy body is: (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2).\n(3, 2) is NOT in this list.\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nIf I go UP to (2, 3):\n(2, 3) is empty.\nIs it in my body? No.\nIs it in enemy body? No (Enemy is x>=7).\nSo UP is safe.\n\nWhich is better?\n(4, 2) is an apple. (2, 6) is an apple.\n(4, 2) is closer.\nHowever, (4, 2) is at the bottom of the board.\n(2, 6) is central left.\nThe enemy is on the right.\nIf I eat (4, 2), I grow.\nMy head will be at (4, 2).\nFrom there, I can go UP to (4, 3), (4, 4) (Apple), (4, 5)...\nRow 4: ` . . . . A . . T A .`\n(4, 4) is Apple.\n(4, 3) is '.'.\n(4, 5) is '.' (Row 5: `. . . . . . . T T .`).\nSo the right-side path is valid.\nBut wait, (4, 4) is an apple.\nMy score is 6. Enemy is 12. I need points.\n(4, 2) is a quick point.\n(4, 4) is another point.\n(2, 6) is a point.\n\nHowever, looking at the board:\nRow 4: `. . . . A . . T A .`\n(7, 4) is 'T' (Enemy body).\nRow 5: `. . . . . . . T T .`\n(7, 5) is 'T'.\n(8, 5) is 'T'.\nRow 6: `. . A . . . . . . .`\n(2, 6) is Apple.\nRow 7: `. . . . A A . . . A`\n(4, 7) is Apple.\n(5, 7) is Apple.\n(9, 7) is Apple.\n\nThe enemy body creates a barrier at x=7, 8, 9 for y=4, 5.\nIf I am at x=4, 5, 6, I am relatively safe from the enemy's body, but I might be \"trapped\" between the enemy and the wall if the enemy moves left.\nThe enemy head is at (8, 3).\nIf I am at (4, 2) or (4, 4), the enemy is far away.\n\nLet's consider the \"Left\" move again.\nLEFT to (1, 2) is fatal (my body).\nSo LEFT is out.\n\nDOWN to (2, 1) is fatal (my body).\nSo DOWN is out.\n\nThe choice is strictly UP or RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 2):\nI approach (4, 2) apple.\nIf I go UP to (2, 3):\nI approach (2, 6) apple.\n\nLet's look at the long-term strategy.\nThe enemy has 12 apples. It is likely targeting the apples on the right side (row 7 has 3 apples; row 9 has many).\nI am on the left.\nIf I stay on the left (x=0, 1, 2, 3), I am away from the enemy.\nThe apple at (4, 2) is at x=4. This is getting closer to the center.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am committing to moving towards the center/right.\nIf I go UP, I am staying on the left.\nStaying on the left seems safer and allows me to claim the left apples without interference.\nThe apple at (4, 2) is tempting, but it might lure me into the center where the enemy might spread.\nAlso, if I eat (4, 2), my tail will extend.\nMy tail is currently at (0, 2).\nIf I eat (4, 2), I grow. My tail does not move that turn.\nIf I don't eat (3, 2), my tail moves to (0, 1) (Wait, no. My tail moves every turn I don't eat).\nCurrent tail: (0, 2).\nIf I move to (3, 2) (and don't eat), my body shifts.\nNew tail: (1, 2).\n(0, 2) becomes empty.\nIf I move to (2, 3) (and don't eat), new tail: (1, 2).\n(0, 2) becomes empty.\n\nLet's check the apple at (0, 1).\nIt is at (0, 1).\nIf I go UP to (2, 3), I am moving away from (0, 1).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 2), I am moving away from (0, 1).\n(0, 1) is an apple.\nCan I go DOWN to (2, 1)? No, that's my body.\nCan I go LEFT to (1, 2)? No, that's my body.\nSo I cannot reach (0, 1) now. I must loop around.\nTo reach (0, 1), I would need to go UP -> LEFT -> DOWN or similar.\nBut (1, 2) is occupied by my body.\nSo I must wait for my tail to move.\nIf I go UP to (2, 3), my body shifts.\nNew tail at (1, 2).\nThe cell (0, 2) becomes empty.\nThe cell (0, 1) is an apple.\nNext turn, I could go UP -> LEFT -> DOWN?\nWait, if I am at (2, 3), can I go LEFT to (1, 3)?\nRow 3: ` . . . . . . . T 1 T`\n(1, 3) is '.'.\nSo (1, 3) is empty.\nIf I am at (2, 3), I can go LEFT to (1, 3).\nFrom (1, 3), can I go DOWN to (1, 2)?\nMy body will be: (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> ... -> (1, 2) (Tail).\n(1, 2) is my tail. If I move to (1, 2), I eat my tail?\nNo, if I move to (1, 2), my tail moves away from (1, 2).\nWait, if I am at (1, 3), and my body is [(1, 3), (2, 3), ... (1, 2)].\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 2), my head goes to (1, 2).\nMy body shifts. The tail moves to (0, 2) or wherever.\nSo (1, 2) becomes the new head.\nThe old (1, 2) (the tail) moves away.\nSo I can safely move into my own tail position.\nHowever, I cannot move into my *current* neck (backwards).\nSo moving into where the tail *is currently* is safe *if* the tail moves away in the same turn.\nBUT, looking at the board:\n(1, 2) is 'T'.\n(0, 2) is 'T'.\n(0, 1) is 'A'.\nIf I go UP to (2, 3), I clear (0, 2) eventually.\nBut (0, 1) is an apple.\nTo get to (0, 1) from (2, 3):\n(2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1).\nThis is 4 moves.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 2):\n(3, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1).\n(1, 2) is occupied by my body (tail).\nIf I am at (3, 2), my body is [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)].\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 2), I hit my body. INVALID.\nSo from (3, 2), I cannot go LEFT.\nFrom (3, 2), I can go UP (3, 3), DOWN (3, 1), RIGHT (4, 2).\nSo I cannot easily loop back to the left side if I go RIGHT to (3, 2).\nOnce I go to (3, 2), I am committed to the right side (x >= 3) until I eat an apple and grow my tail, or wait for my tail to clear a path.\nMy tail is at (1, 2). To clear a path to (0, 1), I need to move my tail away from (1, 2).\nIf I go UP to (2, 3), my tail becomes (1, 2).\n(0, 2) is cleared.\nIf I then go UP -> UP -> UP to (2, 6) and eat, my tail extends.\nIf I don't eat, my tail moves to (0, 2) eventually?\nWait, if I go UP to (2, 3):\nBody: [(2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)].\nTail is (1, 2).\nIf I go UP to (2, 4):\nBody: [(2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)].\nTail is (1, 1).\n(1, 2) is now empty.\nIf I go UP to (2, 5):\nBody: [(2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)].\nTail is (1, 0).\n(1, 1) is empty.\nIf I go UP to (2, 6) and EAT:\nBody: [(2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)].\nTail is (1, 0).\nI did not grow (Wait, I ate an apple, so I grow).\nIf I eat, I don't lose the tail.\nSo if I eat at (2, 6):\nBody: [(2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)].\nThe tail stays at (1, 0).\nSo (0, 1) is still blocked? No, (0, 1) is at x=0, y=1.\nMy body is at x=1, y=0 and x=2.\nSo (0, 1) is adjacent to (1, 1) and (0, 2) and (1, 0).\nMy body at (1, 0) is adjacent to (0, 1).\nIf I am at (2, 6), and I want to go to (0, 1), I have to go down the left side.\n(1, 0) is my tail.\nIf I go to (1, 0), I die (collision with body).\nSo I cannot go to (1, 0).\nTo get to (0, 1), I need to approach from (0, 2) or (1, 1).\n(1, 1) will be occupied by my body if I move down.\nLet's trace it back.\nIf I am at (2, 3), and I want to get to (0, 1).\nPath: (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1).\nAt (0, 3): Body behind me. Tail at (1, 1).\n(0, 2) is empty.\nAt (0, 2): Body behind me. Tail at (1, 0).\n(0, 1) is empty.\nAt (0, 1): I eat the apple.\nSo I can reach (0, 1) safely from the left side (UP path).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 2), I am on the right side.\nFrom (3, 2), I cannot easily go back to (0, 1) because of the body blockage at (2, 2).\nI would have to loop around the top or bottom.\nGoing UP allows me to access both the top-left apples (2,6) (2,8) and eventually the bottom-left apple (0,1).\nGoing RIGHT commits me to the bottom-center/right.\nGiven the enemy is on the far right, and I have apples on the left, going UP is the safer strategic choice to secure the left side territory and keep my options open.\n\nLet's verify safety of UP one last time.\nTarget: (2, 3).\nIs (2, 3) occupied?\nBoard row 3: ` . . . . . . . T 1 T`\n(2, 3) is '.'.\nIs it my body?\nMy body: (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2).\n(2, 3) is NOT in my body.\nIs it enemy body?\nEnemy body is x>=7.\nIs it enemy head?\nEnemy head is (8, 3).\nSo (2, 3) is safe.\n\nWhat about the reverse move logic?\nThe prompt says \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\nMy head is at (2, 2).\nMy neck is at (2, 1).\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 1), I die.\nIf I go UP to (2, 3), I do not go backwards. (2, 3) is not (2, 1).\nSo UP is valid.\n\nFinal check.\nIs there any move better than UP?\nRIGHT to (3, 2) is also safe.\nBut UP secures the left flank.\nThe apple at (4, 2) is at y=2.\nIf I go UP to (2, 3), I am at y=3.\nThe apple at (4, 2) is still accessible later? No, because (2, 2) will be blocked by my body.\nOnce I move UP, (2, 2) becomes my neck.\nIf I want to go to (4, 2) later, I have to go through (3, 2) or (4, 3).\n(4, 3) is empty.\nSo I can access (4, 2) from (4, 3).\n(4, 3) is accessible from (3, 3) or (5, 3) or (4, 2) or (4, 4).\nI can reach (4, 3) from the top-left?\nPath from (2, 3) -> ... -> (4, 3).\n(2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3).\n(3, 3) is empty (Row 3 index 3 is '.').\n(4, 3) is empty (Row 3 index 4 is '.').\nSo I can pivot to the center easily from (2, 3).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 2), I am forced to deal with my tail at (1, 2) blocking the way back to the left.\nGoing UP keeps the left side open.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nMove UP to (2, 3). Prepare to move towards (2, 6). Monitor enemy movement.\n\nMy last move rationale mentioned \"Plan: Secure left column apples (2, 6), (2, 8)\".\nThis move aligns with that plan.\n\nOne final check on the \"T\" at (0, 1) on the board.\nRow 1: `A T T ...`\nIndex 0 is 'A'.\nSo (0, 1) is Apple.\n(1, 1) is 'T' (My body).\n(2, 1) is 'T' (My body).\nSo (0, 1) is an apple adjacent to my body.\nI cannot reach it this turn.\nIt is a future target.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nOne detail: The enemy has 12 apples. I have 6.\nI need to eat fast.\n(2, 6) is 4 moves away.\n(4, 2) is 2 moves away.\nHowever, (4, 2) is on the right side (relative to my current left-side position).\nGoing RIGHT risks encountering the enemy if he expands left.\nGoing UP is safer.\nI will stick to the left side plan.\n\nWait, the apple at (2, 8) is at (2, 8).\nRow 8: ` . . A A . . . . . .`\n(2, 8) is Apple.\n(3, 8) is Apple.\n(2, 8) is straight up.\n(3, 8) is slightly right.\nIf I go UP, I am on the x=2 column.\nI can eat (2, 6) and (2, 8).\nThat's 2 apples.\nMy score becomes 8.\nEnemy has 12.\nStill behind.\nI will need to find more apples later.\nBut for now, safety and points.\n\nIs (2, 3) definitely safe from the enemy?\nYes.\nIs it safe from myself?\nYes.\nIs it safe from walls?\nYes.\n\nUP is the move.\n\nDouble check the board state provided in the prompt against my understanding.\nTurn 25.\nApples at: (4, 9), (5, 9), (2, 8), (0, 1), (3, 8), (6, 9), (4, 7), (9, 7), (2, 6), (8, 9), (4, 4), (5, 7), (8, 4), (4, 2), (0, 9).\nMy head: (2, 2).\nMy body: [(2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2)].\nEnemy head: (8, 3).\nEnemy body: [(9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5)].\n\nBoard:\nRow 2: `T T 0 .

(6,3)\n7: T (7,3) Enemy body.\n8: 1 (8,3) Enemy head.\n9: T (9,3) Enemy body.\n\nSo UP to (2, 3) is indeed empty and safe.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 3)?\n(7, 3) is currently occupied by the enemy body.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 3), it dies (suicide).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (8, 4):\n(8, 4) is Apple (Row 4 index 8 is 'A').\nIf the enemy eats, it grows.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 2):\n(8, 2) is Empty (Row 2 index 8 is '.').\nIf the enemy moves LEFT, it dies.\nSo the enemy will likely go UP or DOWN.\nNeither affects (2, 3).\n\nOkay, UP is correct.\n\nOne thought: The apple at (0, 1) is very close to my current head (2, 2).\n(0, 1) is 2 moves away (Left-Left or Down-Down or Down-Left-Down...).\nWait, (2, 2) to (0, 1).\nPath: (1, 2) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1).\n(1, 2) is my body.\nPath: (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1).\n(2, 1) is my body.\nPath: (2, 1) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> (0, 1).\n(2, 0) is my body.\nSo I cannot reach (0, 1) in 1 move or 2 moves without hitting myself.\nI must grow or move away first.\nUP is the best way to grow (by reaching (2, 6)) or clear space.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nFinal check on the rules.\nSimultaneous movement.\nHead-on collision: If I go UP to (2, 3) and enemy goes LEFT to (7, 3) and somehow teleports? No.\nIf I go UP and enemy goes UP to (8, 4), no collision.\nIf I go UP and enemy goes DOWN to (8, 2), no collision.\n\nI am confident in UP.\n\nOne tiny detail:\nThe apple at (2, 8) is at y=8.\nMy head is at y=2.\nDistance 6.\nThe apple at (4, 2) is at x=4, y=2.\nDistance 2.\nWhy not go RIGHT to (3, 2) then (4, 2)?\nBecause (4, 2) is on the edge of my territory.\nIf I go to (4, 2), I am moving into the \"open\" board.\nIf I go UP, I stay against the wall (left wall).\nSnakes usually prefer walls because they limit attack angles.\nI will stick to the wall.\n\nUP.\n\nOne last check on the apple at (0, 1).\nRow 1: `A T T ...`\nApple is at (0, 1).\nMy body is at (1, 1) and (2, 1) and (0, 2).\nIf I go UP to (2, 3), my body becomes (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2).\n(0, 2) is cleared.\n(0, 1) is still an apple.\n(0, 1) is adjacent to (1, 1) (my body) and (0, 2) (now empty) and (0, 0) (empty).\nIf I want to eat (0, 1), I need to go (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1).\nThis path is clear.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 2):\nMy body: (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2).\n(0, 2) is cleared.\nTo eat (0, 1):\n(3, 2) -> ... -> (0, 1).\nI have to navigate around my body at (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0).\nThis is harder than the UP path.\nUP is definitely better for long-term flexibility.\n\nUP.\n\nThe prompt asks for \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"LEFT\", or \"RIGHT\" on the last line.\nI will output \"UP\".\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nI have thought out loud.\nI will just output the move.\n\nOne detail: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\nMy head is (2, 2).\nMy neck is (2, 1).\nMoving DOWN goes to (2, 1). This is death.\nMoving UP goes to (2, 3). Safe.\nMoving LEFT goes to (1, 2). My body is there. Death.\nMoving RIGHT goes to (3, 2). Safe.\n\nSo UP or RIGHT.\nI've decided UP.\n\nFinal confirmation of the board state for (2, 3).\nRow 3: ` . . . . . . . T 1 T`\nIndex 2 is '.'.\nCorrect.\n\nFinal confirmation for (3, 2).\nRow 2: `T T 0 . A . . T . T`\nIndex 3 is '.'.\nCorrect.\n\nBoth are safe.\nI choose UP because of the left-side strategy.\n\nOne more check on the apple at (4, 2).\nIf I don't take it now, who will?\nThe enemy is at (8, 3).\nTo reach (4, 2), the enemy would need 4 moves.\nI am at (2, 2).\nI can take it in 2 moves.\nIf I go UP, I am moving away from it.\nIs there a risk the enemy gets it?\nUnlikely in the next few turns.\nAnd even if he does, I have the left side apples.\nI'll secure the left side first.\n\nUP.\n\nThe score is 6 vs 12.\nI need points.\n(2, 6) is a point.\n(2, 8) is a point.\n(4, 2) is a point.\n(4, 4) is a point.\n(0, 1) is a point.\n(4, 7) is a point.\n(5, 7) is a point.\n(9, 7) is a point.\n(4, 9) is a point.\n(5, 9) is a point.\n(6, 9) is a point.\n(8, 9) is a point.\n(0, 9) is a point.\n\nThere are many apples.\nSurviving is the priority.\nThe left side is safer.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nWait, if I go UP, I am at (2, 3).\nFrom (2, 3), I can go UP to (2, 4).\nFrom (2, 4), I can go UP to (2, 5).\nFrom (2, 5), I can go UP to (2, 6) and eat.\nThat's 3 turns to eat one apple.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 2), then RIGHT to (4, 2) and eat.\nThat's 1 turn to eat one apple.\nWhy am I choosing the slower path?\nBecause the faster path (RIGHT) leads to a more dangerous area.\nThe left side is a \"safe zone\".\nIn Snake games, secure territory is better than risky points.\nAlso, if I eat on the right, my tail extends on the right.\nIf I eat on the left, my tail extends on the left.\nExtending the tail on the left is safer (against the wall).\nExtending the tail on the right might get in the way if I need to retreat from the enemy.\n\nSo UP is the correct strategic move.\n\nThe prompt says \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nI have done that.\nI have considered the path to (4, 2) and the path to (2, 6).\nI have considered the safety of both.\nI have considered the long-term implications of tail placement.\nUP is the move.\n\nOne last check: Is (2, 3) occupied by an apple?\nRow 3: ` . . . . . . . T 1 T`\nNo, it's empty.\nSo I don't eat this turn.\nThat's fine. I am positioning myself.\n\nI am ready to output.\n\nWait, I should check if the enemy can hit me if I go UP.\nEnemy head (8, 3).\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (7, 3), it hits its own body. Death.\nIf enemy moves UP to (8, 4). Safe.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (8, 2). Safe.\nIf enemy moves LEFT and I am at (2, 3), no collision.\nDistance is too large.\n\nOkay, good.\n\nOne final check on the \"backward move\" rule.\nMy head is at (2, 2).\nMy neck is at (2, 1).\nMoving DOWN to (2, 1) is death.\nMoving UP to (2, 3) is safe.\nMoving LEFT to (1, 2) is death (body is there).\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is safe.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nI will write the plan in my thought process, then output the move.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (2, 3) to align with the column of apples at (2, 6) and (2, 8). This keeps me on the safe left side of the board, away from the enemy. Avoid the center to prevent entrapment.\n\nMove: UP.\n\nI will not add anything after the move word.\n\nOne weird thing: The board state shows `T` at (0, 2) and `T` at (1, 2) and `0` at (2, 2).\nMy body list ends with `(0, 2)`.\nSo (0, 2) is the tail.\nIf I move UP, the tail moves to (1, 2).\n(0, 2) becomes empty.\n(1, 2) becomes the new tail.\n(1, 2) is currently `T` on the board.\nSo it will still be `T` (or become `0` if my head moves there? No, my head moves to (2, 3)).\nSo (1, 2) will remain occupied by my body (as the tail).\nThis is correct.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT to (3, 2), the tail would move to (1, 2) as well.\nSo both moves result in the same tail position (1, 2) (assuming I don't eat).\nThe difference is the head position: (2, 3) vs (3, 2).\n(2, 3) is on the left.\n(3, 2) is in the center.\nLeft is safer.\n\nFinal decision: UP.\n\nResponse:\nUPUP",

          "rationale": "First, I need to assess the current state. My head is at (2, 4). My body occupies: (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1). The enemy snake #1 is at (8, 5) with a long body trailing left and down.\n\nLooking at the board state, there is a treasure cluster at (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (8, 9), and others in the top right quadrant. The enemy snake is closer to that cluster than I am. The enemy is currently at (8, 5) with a body stretching to the left and down. I need to move towards apples while avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet's evaluate my possible moves:\n1.  **UP to (2, 5):** The board shows 'T' at (2, 5) (from the enemy body). The enemy body at (2, 5) is confirmed by the enemy's body list: ... (7, 5), (6, 5)? No, looking at the enemy body list: [(8, 4), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)].\n    Wait, the board state shows: \n    Row 5: `. . . . . . . T 1 .`\n    Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    So at index 7, there is 'T'. That is (7, 5).\n    The enemy head is at (8, 5).\n    My potential move to (2, 5) is clear of the enemy body shown. However, I need to check my own body. (2, 5) is not in my body list.\n    Is (2, 5) on the board? Yes, x=2, y=5 is within 0-9.\n    *Result:* Safe move.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 3):** My body is at (2, 3). Hitting my own body. *Result:* Death.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 4):** Is (1, 4) occupied?\n    My body: (1, 0), (1, 1). Not (1, 4).\n    Enemy body: (8,5), (8,4)... (7,5)... The enemy body does not cover (1, 4).\n    Is it on the board? Yes.\n    *Result:* Safe move.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 4):** Is (3, 4) occupied?\n    My body: No.\n    Enemy body: The enemy is on the right side, but specifically (3, 4) is far away.\n    Board shows `A` at (4, 4). (3, 4) is empty ('.').\n    Is it on the board? Yes.\n    *Result:* Safe move.\n\nSo, all directions except DOWN are technically safe from immediate collision.\n\nNow I must consider the enemy snake and future positioning.\nThe enemy snake has a head at (8, 5) and a long tail stretching to (7, 5), (7, 4)... (8, 0) etc.\nIf I move UP to (2, 5), I am moving closer to the top wall and the apple cluster at (4, 9), (5, 9).\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 4), I am moving closer to the apple at (4, 4) and also towards the right side where the enemy is.\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 4), I am moving away from the main apple cluster and towards the left wall.\n\nLet's look at the apples again: (4, 9), (5, 9), (2, 8), (0, 1), (3, 8), (6, 9), (4, 7), (9, 7), (2, 6), (8, 9), (4, 4), (5, 7), (4, 2), (0, 9), (7, 9).\nThe density of apples is high in the top right (x=4-9, y=7-9). My current position is (2, 4).\nThe enemy is at (8, 5). The enemy is *very* close to that cluster. The enemy snake body is long (13 apples means length 14 including head).\nThe enemy is currently occupying the right side. Moving RIGHT towards (3, 4) brings me closer to the enemy's territory. Given the enemy's length and position, entering the right side (x>3) is risky because the enemy might corner me or head-on collision could occur. The enemy is likely to chase the apples at (4, 9) or (6, 9).\n\nMy body is currently vertical at x=2. If I move UP to (2, 5), I continue the vertical line. This keeps me in the left/middle area, away from the enemy on the right.\nThe apple at (2, 8) is directly above me (up 4 steps). There is also (2, 6) which is 2 steps up. (4, 7) is to the right and up.\nIf I go UP, I can potentially eat (2, 6) and (2, 8).\nIf I go RIGHT, I head into the enemy's area.\nIf I go LEFT, I head to the far left where there are few apples (only (0, 1) and (0, 9), but (0, 9) is hard to reach from the left bottom).\n\nLet's check the board visualization provided:\nRow 5: `. . . . . . . T 1 .`\nRow 4: `. . 0 . A . . T T .`\nRow 3: `. . T . . . . T T T`\n\nAt (2, 5), the board shows '.' (empty).\nAt (1, 4), the board shows '.'.\nAt (3, 4), the board shows '.'.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI have 6 apples. Enemy has 13. I am behind. I need to catch up. The dense apple cluster is at the top right. However, the enemy is already there.\nIf I rush the top right immediately, I risk a head-on collision with the enemy who is already positioned there.\nIf I go LEFT or stay low, I might fall too far behind.\nUP seems like a balanced direction. It moves me toward the apples at (2, 6) and (2, 8) without immediately engaging the enemy.\nAlso, note the apple at (4, 4). Moving RIGHT gets me closer to that apple quickly. But moving RIGHT puts me in the \"enemy corridor\" defined by the enemy's body at (7,5) and the walls/bodies.\nActually, looking at the board, the enemy body at (7,5) and (7,4) creates a wall on the right. The space at (3,4) is open.\nHowever, consider the enemy's next move. The enemy is at (8,5). The apple at (9,7) is nearby. The enemy might move UP or RIGHT/LEFT.\nIf I move UP, I am moving away from the enemy's immediate path (which is mostly horizontal at y=5 and vertical at x=7,8).\nIf I move UP to (2,5), I open up paths to (2,6) and then (2,8).\n\nLet's check if (2,5) is safe in terms of enemy head movement.\nEnemy head at (8,5). It cannot reach me in one turn.\nMy body prevents me from moving DOWN. LEFT and RIGHT are open.\nUP puts me at (2,5).\nIf I go UP, I am not blocking my own future moves as much as going RIGHT might (since my body is vertical at x=2, turning RIGHT to x=3 leaves my tail at x=2, which is fine).\n\n**Comparison of moves:**\n- **UP (2,5):** Moves towards apples (2,6), (2,8), (4,7). Keeps distance from enemy on right.\n- **RIGHT (3,4):** Moves towards apple (4,4). Gets closer to enemy territory.\n- **LEFT (1,4):** Moves away from major apples. Towards (0,1) or (0,9).\n\nGiven the enemy is very strong (13 apples) and positioned on the right, I should probably stay on the left or middle lanes to avoid direct confrontation until I have grown enough. Moving UP aligns with my existing vertical body shape, preserving momentum and options.\n\nI will choose UP. This moves me to (2, 5), safe from immediate collision, and positions me to collect the apple at (2, 6) next turn (if still there) or move towards (2, 8).\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to (2,5). Plan to navigate towards the apples at (2,6) and (2,8) to increase score safely. Avoid the right side where the enemy is dominant.\n\nUP",

The enemy is on the far right side of the board.\n*   **Apple Distribution:** High density of apples in the top-right quadrant (e.g., (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (8,9), (4,7), (5,7)). There are also apples in the top-left ((0,9)) and mid-left ((2,8), (2,6), (4,4)).\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n1.  **DOWN (to 2,3):** This is my own body segment. **Fatal.**\n2.  **UP (to 2,5):**\n    *   **Safety:** The cell (2, 5) is empty (represented as '.' in the board state). It is not occupied by my body or the enemy body.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moving UP maintains a vertical line, which is generally stable. It moves me toward the apples at (2, 6) and (2, 8) on the left side. It keeps me away from the heavily contested right side where the enemy is located. The enemy is at (9, 5) and is likely to continue moving horizontally or toward the top-right apples. Staying at x=2 keeps me separated from the enemy's x=7-9 range.\n3.  **LEFT (to 1,4):**\n    *   **Safety:** The cell (1, 4) is empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me toward the left wall. While safe immediately, it limits future movement options and doesn't offer immediate apple targets as clearly as the UP direction does (the closest apple to the left is (0, 1) or (0, 9), which are out of the way).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3,4):**\n    *   **Safety:** The cell (3, 4) is empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves toward the apple at (4, 4). However, this also moves me closer to the enemy's territory (x > 3). The enemy is currently at x=9 but has a long body that blocks off the right side (x=7-8). Engaging the enemy on the right side is risky given his score advantage (13 vs 6) and length. It is safer to stay on the left/middle lane for now.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will choose **UP**. This move is safe, avoids the enemy, and positions me to collect apples on the left side of the board (specifically targeting (2, 6) and (2, 8)), allowing me to grow safely without immediate confrontation.\n\nUP",

The logic from the previous turn assumed (2, 6) was an apple, but it was empty.\n    *   **Safety:** This move is not immediately fatal (not a wall, not my body, not enemy body).\n    *   **Outcome:** Move to (2, 7). No growth.\n    *   **Strategy:** This continues the vertical ascent. It keeps a safe distance from the enemy on the right.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 5):**\n    *   **Occupancy Check:** (2, 5) is the first element of my body list `[(2, 5), ...]`. It is occupied by my body.\n    *   **Result:** **Fatal**. I would die immediately.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 6):**\n    *   **Occupancy Check:** The board map shows (1, 6) as empty (`.`). My body is at (1, 0) and lower x=2 coordinates. Enemy body is far right.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Outcome:** Move to (1, 6). No growth.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves toward the left wall. Limits future options on the right.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 6):**\n    *   **Occupancy Check:** The board map shows (3, 6) as empty (`.`).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Outcome:** Move to (3, 6). No growth.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves toward the center. Increases proximity to the enemy (currently at x=9), but still far.\n\n**Decision:**\nI must choose between UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. DOWN is fatal.\n\nComparing the safe options:\n- **LEFT** moves me to the edge (x=1), reducing maneuverability.\n- **RIGHT** moves me toward the center (x=3), offering more flexibility but slightly closer to the enemy (who is at x=9, still very far).\n- **UP** maintains my current lane (x=2) and keeps moving away from my tail.\n\nThe **UP** move is consistent with the previous strategy of maintaining a vertical line and avoiding early confrontation. It keeps the path open for potential apples in the upper left region (e.g., (2, 8) or (0, 9)). There is no immediate apple listed at (2, 7), but it positions the head safely for the next turn.\n\nSafety is the priority. Moving UP is safe and avoids trapping myself against the left wall or moving too aggressively toward the enemy.\n\nUP",

It is the most efficient move.\n*   **LEFT** and **RIGHT** are safe but suboptimal as they forfeit a guaranteed point.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (2, 8) immediately to close the score gap slightly (8 vs 14). After securing the apple, I will evaluate the cluster of apples in the top-left corner `(0,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9)` as a potential path. I must remain vigilant of the enemy snake (ID 1) on the right side, but at turn 30, securing points takes priority over defensive positioning against a distant threat.\n\n**Final Move Selection:**\nUP is safe, eats an apple, and is strategically sound.\n\nUP",

Evaluate immediate moves and safety:**\n\n*   **UP to (2, 9):**\n    *   Check board state: (2, 9) is shown as `.` (empty) in the provided board map. Wait, looking closely at the board map line for y=9: `9 A . . . A A A A A .`. The coordinates are (x, y). Let's verify (2, 9). The row is y=9. x=0 is 'A', x=1 is '.', x=2 is '.', x=3 is '.', x=4 is 'A', etc. So (2, 9) is indeed empty.\n    *   Is (2, 9) an apple? The apple list contains: (4,9), (5,9), (0,1), (3,8), (6,9), (4,7), (8,9), (4,4), (5,7), (4,2), (0,9), (7,9), (6,4), (3,4), (5,2). (2,9) is NOT in the apple list. The 'A' on the map usually denotes an apple, but the coordinate list is authoritative. The map shows '.' at (2,9). This implies (2,9) is NOT an apple.\n    *   Safety: (2,9) is within bounds. It is not in my body (my body is at y=7 down to 0). It is not in the enemy body. It is not a wall.\n    *   Outcome: Safe move.

No growth.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 8):**\n    *   Board state: (3, 8) is `A` (Apple). The apple list confirms (3, 8) is present.\n    *   Safety: Within bounds. Not in self. Not in enemy.\n    *   Outcome: Safe move. **Growth.** Eat apple (3,8).\n\n*   **DOWN to (2, 7):**\n    *   Board state: (2, 7) is my body segment (tail).\n    *   Outcome: **Fatal.** Moving into my own body.\n\n**2. Strategic Consideration:**\n\nI have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n- RIGHT allows me to eat an apple immediately. My score is 8, enemy is 14. Every apple counts.\n- UP moves to (2,9). This position is on the edge of the board. My tail is currently at (2,0). If I continue moving UP, I will be moving into a tight corner eventually. The map shows an apple at (0,9). If I go UP to (2,9), I might be able to path to (0,9) or (4,9)/(5,9). However, going RIGHT to (3,8) is currently the only move that yields a point.\n- LEFT moves to (1,8). This is safe but moves away from the apple at (3,8) and into the left side of the board. While the left side has apples at (0,9), (0,1), it is generally less congested than the top right where the enemy is (head at (9,8)).\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis:**\nThe enemy is at (9, 8). Their body stretches down to (9,0) and snakes left to (7,2). They are far away. Direct confrontation is not imminent. My priority should be to grow safely. Getting an apple (RIGHT) is strictly better than not getting an apple (UP/LEFT) if safety is equal.\n\n**4. Future Planning:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 8):\n- I grow. My tail stays at (2,0) (if I don't grow, tail moves, but I grow so tail lengthens). Wait, standard snake rules: if I eat, I add a segment to the tail. So my new body will be: Head (3,8) -> (2,8) -> (2,7) -> ... -> (2,0).\n- Next turn, I will be at (3,8). I can look towards (3,9) or (4,8) or (4,7) (which is an apple) or (4,9) or (5,9). The cluster of apples in the top right is very tempting. The enemy is at (9,8). If I move into the top row, I need to be careful of the enemy coming across, but currently they are far.\n\n**Decision:**\nChoosing RIGHT provides an immediate score increase. The other moves do not. Safety is equivalent.\n\nPlan: Eat the apple at (3,8). Move towards the cluster at (4,9), (5,9), (6,9). Watch out for the enemy snake, but maintain distance.\n\nFinal Move: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

After moving to (9,9), the only viable next step is LEFT to (8,9) to eat the apple there, then continue left along y=9 to grab more apples while the enemy is far away on the left.\n\nPlan:\n- Turn 31: Move UP to (9,9), entering the apple-dense top-right area without immediate danger.\n- Turn 32: Move LEFT to (8,9) to eat the apple at (8,9).\n- Subsequent turns: Continue moving LEFT along y=9 to collect apples at (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9) as safely as possible, keeping an eye on the enemy head at (2,8). The top path minimizes risk of self-collision and walls, and maximizes apple gain.\n\nMove:UP",

The enemy snake (#1) is at (9, 9) and extends downwards along the right side of the board.\n\n**1. Analyze Current Board State & Apples:**\nApples list: (4, 9), (5, 9), (0, 1), (6, 9), (4, 7), (8, 9), (4, 4), (5, 7), (4, 2), (0, 9), (7, 9), (6, 4), (3, 4), (5, 2), (3, 1).\nThere is an apple at **(4, 9)**.\nThere is an apple at **(4, 7)**.\nThere is an apple at **(4, 4)**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Moves from (3, 8):**\n\n*   **UP to (3, 9):**\n    *   Coordinate (3, 9) is `.` (empty) in the map, and NOT in the apple list.\n    *   Is it safe? Yes, it's empty and within bounds.\n    *   Is it strategic? It moves toward the cluster of apples at (4,9), (5,9), (6,9). However, the enemy is at (9, 9). Moving into the top row puts me on the same row as the enemy (y=9). If the enemy moves left, we could collide. The enemy body stretches down the right side, so the top row is relatively clear, but the enemy head is on that row. High risk of interception.\n\n*   **DOWN to (3, 7):**\n    *   Coordinate (3, 7) is `.` (empty).\n    *   Safety: Clear. (3, 7) is not part of my body (my body is at x=2).\n    *   Strategic: This moves toward the apple at **(4, 7)**. It also moves away from the enemy (who is at y=9). This seems safer than UP.\n\n*   **LEFT to (2, 8):**\n    *   Coordinate (2, 8) is part of my own body.\n    *   Outcome: **Fatal**. I die.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 8):**\n    *   Coordinate (4, 8) is `.` (empty).\n    *   Safety: Clear.\n    *   Strategic: This moves toward the apple at **(4, 9)** and **(4, 7)**. It is on the same x-axis as the apple cluster. However, moving RIGHT puts me closer to the enemy snake on the right side. The enemy is at (9, 9) with a long body. If I move right, I am entering the \"center-right\" area.\n\n**3. Strategy Comparison (UP vs DOWN vs RIGHT):**\n*   **UP (3,9):** Moves directly toward the enemy. The enemy is on row 9. While (3,9) is currently safe, engaging on the top row with a longer enemy snake is risky. I have a long body (length 10). Maneuvering in tight corners is hard.\n*   **RIGHT (4,8):** Moves toward (4,9) and (4,7). It puts me on column 4, which has a vertical line of apples (y=9, y=7, y=4). This looks like a good path. However, the enemy is to the right.\n*   **DOWN (3,7):** Moves toward (4,7). This is a safe retreat from the top row. It also aligns me to potentially get the apple at (4,7) or (3,4). It keeps me away from the enemy's immediate vicinity.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\nMy goal is to reach 30 apples. The enemy has 14, I have 9. I need to grow safely. The vertical line at x=4 (apples at y=9, y=7, y=4) is highly attractive. I should try to consume these apples. Moving RIGHT to (4,8) is the direct path to the (4,9) apple, but the enemy is at (9,9). If I move RIGHT now, I will be at (4,8). Next turn, I could move UP to (4,9) to eat that apple. However, the enemy might move left to (8,9) or (7,9). I am currently at x=3. The enemy is at x=9. There is a 6-unit buffer. It is relatively safe to move toward the center-right.\n\nActually, looking closely at the board state at y=9: `9 A . . . A A A A A 1`\nThe apples are at (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9). The enemy head is at (9,9).\nIf I move UP to (3,9), I am at (3,9). I am safe from the apples (they start at x=4).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,8), I am at (4,8). I am safe.\n\nWhich is better?\nMoving UP to (3,9) moves me onto the row occupied by the enemy head. The enemy is long. If the enemy decides to sweep left, I am in the line of fire.\nMoving RIGHT to (4,8) moves me into the column with the apples. I can eat (4,9) next turn (UP) or (4,7) (DOWN).\nHowever, looking at the board map for y=8: `8 . . T 0 . . . . . T`\nWait, my head is at (3,8). The map shows `0` at (3,8)? No, the map shows the *state* at the start of the turn.\nMap Y=8: `8 . . T 0 . . . . . T`\nx=2: T (My body)\nx=3: 0 (My head)\nx=9: T (Enemy body)\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (4,8)**:\nI move to (4,8).\nIs there an apple at (4,8)? The list says no.\nIs it safe? Yes.\nWhy this over UP?\nThe apple at (4,9) is adjacent to (4,8). If I go to (4,8), I can pivot to (4,9) or (4,7).\nIf I go UP to (3,9), I am on the edge. (3,9) has no apple.\nThe apples on row 9 start at x=4.\nI need to get to x=4 to get those apples.\nMoving RIGHT gets me closer to the apple cluster (4,9), (4,7), (4,4).\nMoving UP keeps me at x=3, away from the apples on row 9 (which start at x=4).\nTherefore, **RIGHT** is the best move to position for future apples while staying relatively safe (distance from enemy is 5 units).\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nEnemy is at (9,9). I am at (3,8). Distance is 6 units (Manhattan).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,8), distance becomes 5 units.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (8,9), distance is 5 units.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (9,8), distance is 5 units.\nIt is safe.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove RIGHT to (4,8). This positions me to eat (4,9) or (4,7) next turn and aligns with the vertical apple chain.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (4,8). Prepare to eat apple at (4,9) or (4,7) next turn. Keep distance from enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy Body: Long snake down the right side (x=9 mostly).\n    *   Apples: (4, 9) is directly above my head. (4, 7) is directly below. (5, 9), (6, 9) are nearby.\n\n2.  **Identify Immediate Opportunities/Risks:**\n    *   **Apple at (4, 9):** It is right next to my head. This is a high-value target.\n    *   **Enemy Proximity:** The enemy is at (8, 9). The distance from my head (4, 8) to enemy head (8, 9) is $|8-4| + |9-8| = 5$. This is a safe distance.\n    *   **Board Edge:** My head is at y=8. Moving UP to (4, 9) puts me at the top edge (y=9). This is safe from moving off-board, but restricts movement to y=8 next turn (cannot go UP again).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Move Options from (4, 8):**\n\n    *   **UP to (4, 9):**\n        *   **Safety:** (4, 9) is an apple (not a snake body). My body follows from (4, 8) $\\to$ (3, 8)... so (4, 9) is clear.\n        *   **Gain:** Eat apple -> Score 10.\n        *   **Positioning:** Ends turn at top edge.\n        *   **Enemy Collision:** Enemy at (8, 9). If enemy moves LEFT (to 7,9) or DOWN (to 8,8), no collision. Distance is 4 or 3. Safe.\n\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 7):**\n        *   **Safety:** (4, 7) is an apple. Empty.\n        *   **Gain:** Eat apple -> Score 10.\n        *   **Positioning:** Moves toward center.\n        *   **Risk:** Moving away from the dense apple cluster at y=9. However, (4, 7) is valid.\n\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 8):**\n        *   **Safety:** (3, 8) is my body (neck). Illegal move (suicide). **ELIMINATED**.\n\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n        *   **Safety:** (5, 8) is empty ('.' on board map).\n        *   **Gain:** No apple.\n        *   **Positioning:** Moves toward the apple cluster at (5, 9), (6, 9).\n        *   **Risk:** Increases proximity to the enemy (distance to (8,9) becomes 3). Not optimal when an immediate apple is available.\n\n4.  **Comparison (UP vs DOWN):**\n    *   Both UP and DOWN guarantee an apple eat this turn (Score 10). This is crucial for catching up to the enemy (who has 15 apples).\n    *   **Strategic Value:**\n        *   **UP (to 4,9):** Captures the top-most apple. Puts me at the edge. From (4,9), I can go DOWN (back to 4,8), LEFT (to 3,9), or RIGHT (to 5,9).\n        *   **DOWN (to 4,7):** Captures the lower apple. Puts me in the middle of the board.\n    *   **Long-term Vision:** The apples at (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9) form a horizontal line on the top row. The enemy is at (8,9). By moving UP to (4,9), I secure the left end of this line. From there, I can potentially sweep across the top row (or move DOWN to the vertical line at x=4).\n    *   **Safety Check:** The enemy is at (8,9). If I move UP to (4,9), the distance is 4 cells. The enemy is unlikely to jump 4 cells left in one turn. Even if they move left to (7,9), the distance is 3. It is safe.\n    *   **Comparison:** Moving DOWN to (4,7) is also safe and eats an apple, but it moves away from the cluster of apples on the top row. Since the top row has apples at (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9) (though (8,9) is occupied by enemy head, others are free), targeting (4,9) is the most direct path to multiple apples.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    Move **UP** to (4, 9). This guarantees an apple point immediately and positions me to potentially access the other apples on the top row or pivot back down the x=4 column.\n\n**Final Move Check:**\n- Move: UP.\n- Target: (4, 9).\n- Check: Is it an apple? Yes.\n- Check: Is it occupied by a snake? No.\n- Check: Is it off-board? No.\n- Check: Is it my own body? No.\n- Check: Is it enemy body? No.\n- Result: Safe and beneficial.\n\nPlan: Move UP to eat the apple at (4, 9). Secure the score. From (4, 9), evaluate next move: likely RIGHT to (5, 9) to continue the top-row sweep, or DOWN if the enemy moves aggressively left.\n\nUP",

UP and RIGHT are unsafe (off board or into your own neck/body).\n- The board shows apples at (7,9) and (8,9) among others on the top row. Moving LEFT to (7,9) lets you eat an apple this turn, increasing your apples and staying in a dense apple corridor.\n- Moving DOWN to (8,8) would miss the immediate apple opportunity and keep you in a straight corridor with fewer immediate gains.\n- Enemy snake #0 is far on the left half; no immediate head-on collision risk from this choice this turn. Both options keep you alive this turn.\n\nPlan:\n- Take the immediate apple by moving LEFT to (7,9).\n- After eating, aim to sweep the top row (leftwards then back towards center) while watching enemy #0\u2019s movement to avoid trap-like collisions or being boxed in.\n- Keep an eye on the neck and avoid any self-traps; maintain multiple safe exits to prevent getting cornered as apple count rises.\n\nAction: \n\nLEFT",

Enemy Body: Long snake down the right side (x=9 mostly).\n    *   Apples: (5, 9) and (6, 9) are to the right on the same row. (4, 7) is directly below the previous position.\n\n2.  **Identify Immediate Opportunities/Risks:**\n    *   **Apple at (5, 9):** Directly to the right of my head. This is a high-value target.\n    *   **Enemy Proximity:** The enemy is at (7, 9). The distance from my head (4, 9) to enemy head (7, 9) is $|7-4| + |9-9| = 3$. This is closing in.\n    *   **Board Edge:** My head is at y=9 (top edge). I cannot move UP. I can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Move Options from (4, 9):**\n\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 9):**\n        *   **Safety:** (5, 9) is an apple (not a snake body). My body follows from (4, 9) $\\to$ (4, 8)... so (5, 9) is clear.\n        *   **Gain:** Eat apple -> Score 11.\n        *   **Positioning:** Moves me along the top row towards the center.\n        *   **Enemy Collision:** If enemy moves LEFT (to 6,9) or DOWN (to 7,8), no collision. Distance becomes 2 if enemy moves left. Risky but manageable.\n\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 8):**\n        *   **Safety:** (4, 8) is my body (neck). Illegal move (suicide). **ELIMINATED**.\n\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 9):**\n        *   **Safety:** (3, 9) is empty (board shows '.').\n        *   **Gain:** No apple.\n        *   **Positioning:** Moves me away from the enemy and the apple cluster at (5, 9), (6, 9).\n        *   **Risk:** Losing access to the immediate apple. While safe from immediate collision, it yields no score and gives the enemy the chance to eat the apple at (5, 9) or (6, 9).\n\n4.  **Comparison (RIGHT vs LEFT):**\n    *   **RIGHT** guarantees an apple eat this turn (Score 11). This is critical to closing the gap on the enemy (who has 16 apples).\n    *   **LEFT** is safe but passive. It yields no points and moves away from the objective.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** The top row contains a chain of apples (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9). The enemy is at (7,9). By moving RIGHT to (5,9), I secure the next apple and position myself to potentially intercept or contest the apple at (6,9) next turn.\n    *   **Safety Check:** The enemy is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (5,9), the distance is 2. If the enemy moves LEFT to (6,9), we are adjacent. If the enemy moves LEFT and I move LEFT next turn, we could collide. However, if I eat the apple at (5,9), I grow. This is necessary to catch up.\n    *   **Risk Mitigation:** If the enemy moves LEFT aggressively, I can pivot DOWN (to 5,8) or LEFT (to 4,9) next turn to avoid a head-on collision.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    Move **RIGHT** to (5, 9). This guarantees an apple point immediately and positions me to continue the sweep across the top row. Passive play (LEFT) allows the enemy to dominate the board.\n\n**Final Move Check:**\n- Move: RIGHT.\n- Target: (5, 9).\n- Check: Is it an apple? Yes.\n- Check: Is it occupied by a snake? No.\n- Check: Is it off-board? No.\n- Check: Is it my own body? No.\n- Check: Is it enemy body? No.\n- Result: Safe and beneficial.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to eat the apple at (5, 9). Secure the score. From (5, 9), evaluate next move: likely RIGHT to (6, 9) to continue the top-row sweep, or DOWN if the enemy moves aggressively left.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

It is part of my body (the segment immediately connecting to my head).\n        *   The cell (5, 8) is below me. The board state shows an Apple (A) at (4, 7) and a Tail (T) at (4, 8). (5, 8) is not listed as a snake body. It is empty.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n        *   Head: (6, 9). Distance from my head (5, 9) is 1 unit to the right.\n        *   Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)...]. The enemy body blocks the path to the right.\n    *   **Apples:**\n        *   (5, 9) was eaten last turn (I am standing on it now, but it counts as collected).\n        *   (6, 9) is an apple, but it is occupied by the enemy head.\n        *   (4, 7) is an apple 2 units below. It is reachable.\n        *   (5, 7) is an apple, but looking at the board state for row 7, the display shows \"A A\" at columns 4 and 5. However, the enemy body section for Snake #1 lists \"(7, 1)\" as the tail end, but also extends up. Wait, looking at the board state row 7: `7 . A T . A A . A . T`. The 'T' at column 2 suggests a body part at (2, 7). My own body includes (2, 7). The coordinates listed for the enemy body are mostly (9, y) and (8, y). The board state visualization might be simplified. Let's check the specific coordinates provided for Snake #1: `Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1)]`.\n        *   (5, 7) is an apple. Is it safe? The enemy head is at (6, 9). The enemy is likely moving. The distance from (6, 9) to (5, 7) is $|6-5| + |9-7| = 3$. If the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 9), that is a collision with me (if I stay) or a space I vacate. If the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 8), distance becomes 2.\n        *   The apple at (4, 7) is closer to my current position (5, 9) than (5, 7) is? No, distance to (4, 7) is $|5-4| + |9-7| = 3$. Distance to (5, 7) is 3.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves from (5, 9):**\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 9):**\n        *   Collision: Enemy head is at (6, 9). If I move RIGHT and he moves anywhere (LEFT, DOWN), we collide heads. If he stays (impossible, he must move), we collide. Even if he dies simultaneously, head-on collision kills both. We don't want to trade.\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 9):**\n        *   Collision: My body starts at (4, 9). Moving into my own neck is suicide. **DEAD**.\n    *   **UP:** Off board. **DEAD**.\n    *   **DOWN to (5, 8):**\n        *   Safety Check:\n            *   Board Boundary: Valid.\n            *   Own Body: (5, 8) is not in my body list.\n            *   Enemy Body: Enemy body is at x=9, x=8, and (7,9). (5, 8) is clear.\n            *   Enemy Head: Enemy is at (6, 9).\n        *   Outcome: I survive.\n        *   Targeting: From (5, 8), I can reach the apple at (4, 7) (via LEFT then DOWN) or (5, 7) (via DOWN).\n\n3.  **Long-term Strategy:**\n    The enemy is at (6, 9) with 17 apples. I have 11 apples. I am on the top edge, boxed in by my own body to the left and the enemy to the right. Moving DOWN is the only path forward. The enemy is likely to chase apples on the right side or try to loop back. By moving DOWN, I open up the center and bottom of the board where apples (4, 4), (3, 4), (4, 7), etc., are located. I must avoid the enemy's body (which occupies the right side heavily) and plan a route that doesn't trap me.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **DOWN** to (5, 8). This avoids immediate death (suicide or head-on collision) and positions me to approach the apple at (4, 7) or (5, 7) next turn.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Based on the current board state and the positioning of both snakes, here is the analysis for the next move:\n\n**1. Immediate Threat Assessment:**\n- **Current Position:** My head is at (5, 8) (after the last move DOWN).\n- **Enemy Head:** Enemy #1 is at (6, 8) (based on the move sequence: it was at (6, 9) last turn, and likely moved DOWN, or potentially RIGHT to (7, 8)). The enemy body follows a path along the right and top edges. If the enemy moved DOWN to (6, 8), we are adjacent.\n- **Board Constraints:** My body extends leftwards from (5, 8) to (2, 2). The left side of the board (columns 0-1) is largely free of my own body but contains some apples.\n\n**2. Evaluating Moves from (5, 8):**\n- **UP:** Moves to (5, 9). This is where my body currently is (the neck). **Invalid/Suicide.**\n- **DOWN:** Moves to (5, 7).\n    - **Board State:** (5, 7) contains an Apple ('A').\n    - **Safety:** The enemy is at (6, 8) or nearby. (5, 7) is not currently occupied by any known snake body. Moving DOWN avoids the immediate adjacency of the enemy head if it is at (6, 8), moving me to a safer distance.\n    - **Outcome:** Eat apple, grow, score +1.\n- **LEFT:** Moves to (4, 8).\n    - **Board State:** (4, 8) is a 'T' (Tail/Body) in the visual representation. Checking the body lists: My body is [(5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8)...]. (4, 8) is indeed part of my own body (the segment after (4, 9)). Moving LEFT puts my head into my own body. **Invalid/Suicide.**\n- **RIGHT:** Moves to (6, 8).\n    - **Safety:** This is extremely dangerous. The enemy head is likely at (6, 8) or (7, 8). If the enemy moved DOWN from (6, 9) to (6, 8), moving RIGHT results in a head-on collision (both die). If the enemy moved RIGHT to (7, 8), (6, 8) is part of the enemy's body (specifically, the segment at (6, 9) becomes the neck, and the body follows). Moving into any snake's body is fatal.\n\n**3. Decision:**\n- **DOWN** is the only move that is definitely safe from immediate collision (given the body lists and probable enemy movement) and offers a reward (Apple at (5, 7)).\n- Moving DOWN also positions the snake to potentially loop around the bottom-left area, where there are multiple apples ((0, 1), (3, 1), etc.), away from the enemy which is dominating the right side.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (5, 7). From (5, 7), navigate towards the cluster of apples on the left side of the board (columns 0-3) to gain points while keeping distance from the enemy on the right.\n\nDOWN",

My body is to the West (Left). The open space is to the East (Right) and South. The enemy is highly likely to move **DOWN** to (6, 6) or **RIGHT** to (7, 7).\n    *   **My Potential Moves:**\n        *   **UP (5, 8):** Invalid. It is part of my own body (segment 0).\n        *   **DOWN (5, 6):** Current board shows 'A' at (4, 7) and 'A' at (5, 2). (5, 6) is empty. Not blocked by my body. Not currently in enemy's body.\n        *   **LEFT (4, 7):** Current board shows 'A'. My body occupies (4, 8), (4, 9). (4, 7) is empty. However, the enemy is at (6, 7). If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (5, 7), we collide. If the enemy moves **DOWN** or **RIGHT**, I am safe.\n        *   **RIGHT (6, 7):** Current board shows '1' (Enemy Head). If I move here, it is a head-on collision if the enemy stays, or I enter the enemy's old position (which is safe if they leave, but risky if they don't). However, if the enemy moves **LEFT** to (5, 7) and I move **RIGHT** to (6, 7), we collide.\n\n3.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **Option 1: UP.** Invalid. Suicide.\n    *   **Option 2: LEFT (to 4, 7).**\n        *   *Pros:* Eats an apple immediately (Score 13). Opens a path towards the cluster at (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 6).\n        *   *Cons:* If the enemy moves **LEFT** (to 5, 7), we collide (Head-on). The enemy has 17 apples and wants to stop my growth. Staying on the same row (y=7) is dangerous as the enemy is right there.\n    *   **Option 3: RIGHT (to 6, 7).**\n        *   *Pros:* None.\n        *   *Cons:* Immediate head-on collision or body collision.\n    *   **Option 4: DOWN (to 5, 6).**\n        *   *Pros:* Increases distance from the enemy head at (6, 7). Clears the \"front line\". Opens a path down the center to grab apples at (5, 2), (4, 4), (3, 4).\n        *   *Cons:* Misses the apple at (4, 7). However, safety is paramount to catch up (Enemy 17 vs Me 12).\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   The enemy is dominating the right side and is in a strong position (Score 17). My priority must be survival to close the gap.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** is the safest play against a likely aggressive or defensive move from the enemy (who sees me at (5, 7)). Moving down avoids the immediate collision zone on row 7 and column 6.\n    *   From (5, 6), I have options: LEFT to (4, 6) or DOWN to (5, 5). This keeps my future moves flexible.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 6) to distance myself from the enemy at (6, 7). This secures my survival for this turn. From (5, 6), I will navigate towards the central apples at (5, 2) and (4, 4) to increase my score.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "The enemy snake (ID 1) has a significant lead (18 apples vs 12). To catch up, I need to gain points while ensuring survival. The enemy is currently at (7, 7), positioned to the right of my head (5, 6). My body occupies (5, 7) and extends leftward to (2, 3). The apple at (6, 4) is a high-value target as it is adjacent to my current head (5, 6) and lies in a relatively open area.\n\nAnalyzing potential moves from (5, 6):\n- **UP (5, 7)**: This is occupied by my own body segment (the neck). Moving here results in immediate death.\n- **LEFT (4, 6)**: This cell is currently empty. It does not contain an apple, but it positions my head near the apple at (4, 7) or (3, 6) for the next turn. However, moving left takes me towards my own body's \"tail\" area (though still open), and leaves me vulnerable if the enemy decides to move leftwards aggressively.\n- **RIGHT (6, 6)**: This cell is currently empty. It is adjacent to the apple at (6, 4) (two steps away) and the apple at (4, 7) (diagonally). Moving right moves me away from my own body, giving me more maneuvering space.\n- **DOWN (5, 5)**: This cell is empty. It moves me closer to the apple at (5, 2) and opens up the lower board.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nThe enemy is at (7, 7). If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (6, 7), they will be adjacent to my current head at (5, 6), but not in the same cell (unless I move into (6, 7)). \n- If I move **RIGHT** to (6, 6), and the enemy moves **LEFT** to (6, 7), we do not collide. If the enemy moves **DOWN** to (7, 6), we do not collide. \n- Crucially, if I move **RIGHT**, I approach the apple at (6, 4). The coordinate (6, 6) is a central position that allows access to multiple apples: (4, 4), (3, 4), and (6, 4).\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\nI need to start closing the apple gap. The apple at (6, 4) is highly attractive. It is not immediately reachable in one turn (distance 2), but moving towards it is efficient. \nComparing **RIGHT** vs **DOWN**:\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 6) aligns with the apple at (6, 4). From (6, 6), I can move DOWN to (6, 5), then (6, 4) to eat the apple. \n- Moving **DOWN** to (5, 5) aligns with the apple at (5, 2). From (5, 5), I can move DOWN to (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2).\n- Moving **LEFT** to (4, 6) aligns with apples at (4, 7) or (3, 6).\n\nThe board visualization shows that the right side (X=6) is relatively clear below Y=6. The enemy is currently at Y=7. Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 6) is safe from immediate collision (enemy at 7,7 cannot reach 6,6 in one move unless moving LEFT and DOWN simultaneously which is impossible). If the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), we are safe. If the enemy moves LEFT to (6,7), we are safe. \n\nTherefore, **RIGHT** is the safest move that also sets me up to chase the (6, 4) apple efficiently.\n\nRIGHT",

My immediate survival is critical, but I must aggressively pursue apples to close the gap.\n\n**Analysis of Moves from (6, 6):**\n1.  **UP (6, 7):**\n    *   **Risk:** High. The enemy snake's head is at (7, 7). Their body occupies (6, 7) and (6, 8). Moving UP puts my head directly into the enemy's body.\n    *   **Outcome:** Immediate death. **REJECTED.**\n2.  **LEFT (5, 6):**\n    *   **Risk:** High. My own body occupies (5, 6) (it has not moved yet). Moving into my own body results in death. **REJECTED.**\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 6):**\n    *   **Risk:** Moderate. The enemy body occupies (9, 6) and (8, 6)? No, looking at the board: (9, 6) is 'T' (enemy tail). (8, 6) is empty ('.' on row 6). (7, 6) is empty ('.' on row 6).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moving RIGHT moves me toward the center/right side. However, I am currently at (6, 6). The area to the right is open, but I am already very close to high-value apples to the LEFT and DOWN: (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 7).\n4.  **DOWN (6, 5):**\n    *   **Risk:** Very Low. The cell (6, 5) is empty on the board map.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moving DOWN moves me toward the dense cluster of apples in the lower left and center: (4, 4), (3, 4), (5, 2). Specifically, from (6, 5), I can reach (5, 4) or (4, 4) or (3, 4) in the following turns. This path is safer than moving RIGHT because it moves *away* from the enemy's head at (7, 7).\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nThe enemy is at (7, 7) and is likely hunting apples in the upper right (9, 0 - 9, 9 region). I am currently at (6, 6). The board is full of apples, specifically in the area (3, 4) to (6, 4). I need to loop through these apples efficiently.\n\nMy body is currently \"folding\" at (5, 6), (5, 7)... blocking the path UP and LEFT. However, the tail is at (2, 4).\nMoving **DOWN** to (6, 5) opens up the following path:\n1.  **Current Turn:** Move DOWN to (6, 5).\n2.  **Next Turn:** Move DOWN to (6, 4) to eat the apple at (6, 4).\n3.  **Following Turn:** Move LEFT to (5, 4) or further to (4, 4) / (3, 4).\n\nThis path allows me to eat multiple apples in the center of the board while keeping distance from the enemy snake in the top right. The board visualization shows that the column X=6 below Y=6 is empty and safe.\n\n**Decision:**\nAvoid the enemy at (7, 7) and my own body at (5, 6). Move DOWN.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Its body occupies the top right region.\n\nEvaluating moves from (6, 5):\n1.  **UP (6, 6):** My own body occupies (6, 6). This is a collision. **REJECTED**.\n2.  **LEFT (5, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **DOWN (6, 4):** There is an apple at (6, 4). Empty. Safe.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Apple Clusters:** There is a cluster of apples at (4, 4), (3, 4), and (6, 4).\n*   **Enemy:** Snake #1 is at (8, 8). It is far enough away that I shouldn't worry about immediate collision, but I need to keep moving towards apples to catch up (12 vs 18).\n*   **Pathing:**\n    *   If I go **DOWN** to (6, 4), I eat an apple. From there, I can go LEFT to (5, 4) or (4, 4).\n    *   If I go **LEFT** to (5, 5), I am safe. From there, I can go DOWN to (5, 4) or LEFT to (4, 5).\n    *   If I go **RIGHT** to (7, 5), I move away from the central apple cluster.\n\n**Comparison of DOWN vs LEFT:**\n*   **Move DOWN (to 6, 4):**\n    *   Immediate reward: Eat apple at (6, 4).\n    *   Next position: (6, 4). From here, I can go LEFT to (5, 4) or (4, 4) next turn. The cell (6, 3) is empty but doesn't lead to a high density of apples immediately.\n    *   Risk: Low. My body is moving away (tail at (2, 5) will move to (2, 4)).\n*   **Move LEFT (to 5, 5):**\n    *   Immediate reward: None.\n    *   Next position: (5, 5). From here, I can go DOWN to (5, 4) (apple at (5, 2) is further down) or LEFT to (4, 5).\n    *   Risk: Low.\n\n**Decision:**\nI need to close the gap. Eating an apple now is better than delaying, provided it doesn't trap me. Moving DOWN to (6, 4) puts me on an apple and adjacent to the cluster at (5, 4) and (4, 4).\nMy tail is currently at (2, 5). Moving DOWN to (6, 4) means my tail will move to (2, 4), clearing the path for me to move left across the row Y=4.\nThe cell (6, 3) below (6, 4) is empty, so I have an exit if I get trapped, but the best path is to eat (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4).\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 5), I don't eat an apple this turn. That is slower. I need to catch up.\nChecking safety: (6, 4) is empty. Enemy is at (8, 8).\n\nI will move **DOWN** to eat the apple at (6, 4) and set up for the leftward cluster.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Board state at turn 41:\n\n**My Snake (ID 0):**\n- **Head:** (6, 4) (This is the result of my last move DOWN. The board state in the prompt shows the board *before* my last move was processed. The prompt's \"last move info\" confirms the head moved to (6, 4).)\n- **Body:** [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)]\n- **Apples:** 13 (I ate the apple at (6, 4) on turn 40, so I should have 14 apples. The prompt says 13, likely due to the state snapshot timing, but I play the board).\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n- **Head:** (7, 8)\n- **Body:** [(8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 2)]\n- **Apples:** 18\n\n**Apples (Updated for my consumption at (6, 4)):**\n- (0, 1), (4, 7), (4, 4), (4, 2), (0, 9), (3, 4), (5, 2), (3, 1), (1, 7), (3, 6), (4, 3), (2, 9), (1, 1), (0, 3), (4, 1)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI am currently at (6, 4). My body extends to the right and up.\n- **UP (6, 5):** My own body. **DEADLY**.\n- **LEFT (5, 4):** Occupied by an apple (4, 4 is at (4,4), but (5,4) is empty based on the map. Wait, looking at the map row 4: `. . . A A . 0 . T .`. The apples are at (3,4) and (4,4). (5,4) is empty. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT (7, 4):** The board map shows (7, 4) is empty (row 4: `. . . A A . 0 . T .`). **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN (6, 3):** The board map shows (6, 3) is empty (row 3: `A . . . A . . . T T`). **SAFE**.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nMy goal is to catch up to Snake #1 (18 apples vs 14/13). I need to eat efficiently.\nThe cluster of apples is at (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2).\nMoving **LEFT** to (5, 4) sets me up perfectly to eat (4, 4) next turn, and then (3, 4).\nMoving **DOWN** to (6, 3) sets me up to eat (5, 2) or (4, 2), but (6, 3) is adjacent to (5, 3) which is empty, and (6, 2) is empty. However, (6, 3) is further from the dense cluster.\nMoving **RIGHT** to (7, 4) moves me away from the apple cluster and towards the enemy snake's general area (he is at (7,8)). This is risky and inefficient.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is at (7, 8). Its body is very long and occupies the top-right corner (8,8 to 9,2).\nIf Snake #1 moves DOWN to (7, 7), it hits its own body at (7, 7) (which is part of the list `(7, 7)`). Wait, the body list is `(8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)...`. So (7, 7) is occupied by Snake #1.\nIf Snake #1 moves LEFT to (6, 8), it hits (6, 8) which is in its body list.\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (7, 9), it hits (7, 9) in its body.\nIf Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (8, 8), it hits (8, 8) in its body.\nSnake #1 is effectively trapped or very restricted in the top right. It cannot move safely in many directions. It is likely to die or be forced to move into a corner.\nI should focus on eating apples to increase my score, as Snake #1 may eliminate itself.\n\n**Decision:**\nI need to move towards the apple cluster at (3,4), (4,4), (4,3).\nFrom (6, 4), moving **LEFT** to (5, 4) is the optimal move. It puts me directly adjacent to two apples (4, 4) and (4, 3) for the next turn, and (5, 2) is reachable too.\n(5, 4) is empty.\n(5, 5) is empty (body is at (6,5)).\n(5, 3) is empty.\n(4, 4) is an apple.\n\nI will move LEFT.\n\nLEFT",
