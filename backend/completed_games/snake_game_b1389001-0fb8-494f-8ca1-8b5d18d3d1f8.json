Your head is at (2,7). Moving in any direction won't overlap with the enemy head on this turn (no immediate collision).\n\n### Safe Moves:\nAll four directions are safe at this moment.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n- Closest apple is at (2,8), which is directly above your head (y increases up). Moving UP will take you to (2,8) and eat the apple immediately.\n- Other apples are farther away (e.g., (1,6) is diagonally up-left, (5,2) is down-right, etc.).\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Immediate gain**: Moving UP to (2,8) is the fastest way to eat the closest apple and grow your snake.\n- **Future options**: After eating the apple, your snake will have a body segment at (2,7) and head at (2,8). This will limit future moves to avoid hitting the tail (backwards movement is now unsafe). However, since the enemy snake is far away and has no body, this is manageable.\n\n### Enemy Behavior:\n- The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body. It will likely move in a direction that avoids immediate collision with you, but since you're growing, it may try to intercept later turns.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n1. **Turn 1**: Move UP to (2,8), eat apple, grow snake.\n2. **Turn 2**: From new head (2,8), avoid moving backwards (down) to prevent hitting tail. Consider moving LEFT or RIGHT to keep options open.\n3. **Turn 3**: Prioritize eating the next closest apple (e.g., (1,6) or (3,4)) while avoiding enemy snake.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe move UP is the most optimal at this moment because it maximizes immediate gain and sets up a strong position for future growth.\n\nUP",
