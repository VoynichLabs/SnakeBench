I'd die by running into myself\n\nSo RIGHT is not an option since I'd hit my own body.\n\nNow let me assess the apple situation:\n- Apple at (1, 4) - still my primary target, requires continuing left and slightly up\n- Apple at (0, 2) - bottom-left corner\n- Apple at (0, 0) - bottom-left corner  \n- Apple at (4, 0) - bottom middle\n- Apple at (2, 3) - wait, this one wasn't in my previous analysis! This is actually closer than (1, 4)\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (3, 3) with body at [(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)]. It's very close to the apple at (2, 3) - just one move to the left for them. However, I should still consider it since I might be able to reach it.\n\nActually, let me recalculate distances:\n- To reach (2, 3) from (6, 6): I need to go 4 steps left and 3 steps down = 7 total moves\n- Enemy snake at (3, 3) to reach (2, 3): just 1 step left = 1 move\n\nThe enemy will definitely get the (2, 3) apple before me, so I should stick with my original plan to go for (1, 4).\n\nTo reach (1, 4) from (6, 6): I need 5 steps left and 2 steps down, but I could also go 5 left and 2 up. Actually, (1, 4) is at the same Y level as where I want to be, so I need 5 steps left and then 2 steps up to reach Y=4.\n\nContinuing LEFT to (5, 6) keeps me on track toward (1, 4) and maintains safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving left toward apple at (1, 4). After collecting that, target the bottom-left apples (0, 2) and (0, 0) which should be safer territory.\n\nLEFT"

This is great!\n\nWait, let me double-check the apple positions. The apples are at: (4, 0), (1, 5), (2, 6), (6, 1), (8, 4). Yes, there's definitely an apple at (8, 4) right next to me!\n\nThis is perfect - I can move RIGHT to (8, 4) and immediately collect another apple, growing my snake and gaining a point. This is much better than continuing toward the (6, 1) apple since I can get an immediate reward.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (8, 4), my head will be at (8, 4) and my body will be at [(7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5)], making me even longer.\n\nThe remaining apples after this move will be: (4, 0), (1, 5), (2, 6), (6, 1). I'll need to plan my next move carefully to avoid the enemy snake while targeting these remaining apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (8, 4), I'll be at the right edge of the board. I'll need to move either DOWN to (8, 3), LEFT to (7, 4) (which will be part of my body), or UP to (8, 5). Moving DOWN to (8, 3) seems like the best option to start positioning toward the remaining apples while staying safe.\n\nRIGHT"

Looking at the board representation, I see \"1\" at (6, 1) which indicates the enemy snake's head, and the enemy snake body extends to positions like (5, 1), (4, 1), etc.\n\nThis means the apple I was targeting at (6, 1) is actually occupied by the enemy snake's head! I need to reassess the apple positions.\n\nLooking at the available apples:\n- (1, 5) - quite far, would require navigating around obstacles\n- (2, 6) - also far and requires careful navigation\n- (7, 8) - far up and right\n- (6, 8) - directly above me but very far (5 steps up)\n- (5, 8) - also far up\n\nGiven my current position at (6, 3), the most accessible apple appears to be (6, 8) since it's directly above me, though it's 5 steps away. I could move UP repeatedly to reach it.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the tactical situation. The enemy snake is quite long and positioned in the lower part of the board. Moving UP toward (6, 8) keeps me away from the enemy and gives me room to maneuver.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP toward the apple at (6, 8). This keeps me away from the enemy snake and gives me a clear path to food. Monitor the enemy's movement to ensure I don't get trapped.\n\nUP"

I'm still well-positioned to reach the apple cluster at the top\n2. The enemy snake is slightly to my left and above, but not blocking my path\n3. Continuing UP makes the most sense because:\n   - It maintains the direct path to the (7,8) apple\n   - Keeps distance from the enemy snake\n   - Doesn't box myself in\n\nNext turn strategy: Keep moving upward if safe, but be ready to move right if the enemy snake moves toward my path.

This was my target from last turn.\n- (5, 8) - One left and 3 up from current position\n- (7, 8) - One right and 3 up from current position\n- (2, 6) - Far to the left, 4 left and 1 up\n- (1, 5) - Very far left, 5 left at same y-level\n\nThe enemy snake (#1) has its head at (7, 2) and occupies most of the bottom area. It's still far from me and my current path.\n\nSince there are three apples clustered at y=8 (positions 5, 6, and 7), I should continue moving toward that row. The apple at (6, 8) is still the most direct target - just 3 moves straight up.\n\nMoving UP to (6, 6) keeps me on the direct path to (6, 8), maintains good distance from the enemy snake, and positions me well to potentially grab other apples in that cluster if needed.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP toward the apple cluster at y=8. After reaching (6, 8), I can evaluate which of the adjacent apples at (5, 8) or (7, 8) to target next.\n\nUP"
