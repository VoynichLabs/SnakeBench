If I can get to the apples at (6, 9) and (7, 4), I might be able to start moving my body in those directions and create more options for myself.\n\nConsider why I should choose a certain direction: if I go left, I risk running into the enemy snake at (0, 0), or even into myself if I'm not careful. Going down wouldn't get me closer to the apples. Going right won't bring me closer to the apples either. However, going up seems like the most appealing choice, since the apple is right above me and it would be the safest and most efficient move to make.\n\nNext move: UP",
