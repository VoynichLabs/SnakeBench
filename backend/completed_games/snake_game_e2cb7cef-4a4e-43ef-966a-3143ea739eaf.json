Unfortunately there is no truly safe move this turn, so I’ll keep hugging the bottom row and hope the opponent’s body shifts enough to let me slip into the empty space near (2,1) before committing to a northward dash.\n\nPlan: Keep following the bottom row to pressure the (2,1) apple once Snake #0’s spine vacates the immediate area, then turn up the least congested column to pick up the northwestern apples while avoiding new traps around their head.\n\nLEFT",
