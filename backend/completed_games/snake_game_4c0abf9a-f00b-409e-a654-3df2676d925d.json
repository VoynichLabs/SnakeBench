The board walls are safe as long as we keep within the 0\u20139 x and y boundaries.\n\nThere are five apples on the board: (9,7), (8,3), (9,0), (0,2), and (3,9). From our head at (6,8) the two closest (by Manhattan distance) are:\n\u2022 (9,7): \u0394x = +3, \u0394y = \u20131 (distance 4)\n\u2022 (3,9): \u0394x = \u20133, \u0394y = +1 (distance 4)\n\nHowever, going toward (3,9) would require moving LEFT or UP. We already can\u2019t move UP because (6,9) is occupied by our body, and LEFT from (6,8) would put us into (5,8), which is also part of our body. Therefore our best target apple is (9,7).\n\nFrom our current position (6,8) the legal adjacent moves are:\n\u2022 UP \u2192 (6,9): Blocked (our body)\n\u2022 LEFT \u2192 (5,8): Blocked (our body)\n\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 (7,8): Free\n\u2022 DOWN \u2192 (6,7): Free\n\nSince the (9,7) apple lies to the right and slightly down from our head (we need to increase x while eventually matching y = 7), moving RIGHT to (7,8) is a good step toward our target apple. It also leaves us flexibility in subsequent moves while avoiding any immediate collisions.\n\nI\u2019ll choose the next move as RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

In a sample route we might do:\n\u2022 Starting at (9,7), move LEFT to (8,7).  \n\u2022 Then go downward and further left (avoiding our own body and enemy parts) until we are in a column safe enough to drop down into row 2 (or lower) where enemy snake isn\u2019t present.  \n\u2022 Finally, we\u2019d traverse back east along the bottom row toward (8,0) before moving RIGHT to capture the apple at (9,0).\n\nIn contrast, a direct DOWN move puts us in column 9 where we must later detour\u2014risking an encounter with enemy parts.

My snake\u2019s current body segments are at:\n\u2003(6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7)\n\nThere are apples at (0,2), (3,9), (0,0), (1,9) and (1,6). Although my earlier strategic target was (3,9), from (6,6) the apple at (1,6) is even closer:\n\u2003\u2022 Distance to (1,6): |6\u20131| + |6\u20136| = 5\n\u2003\u2022 Distance to (3,9): |6\u20133| + |6\u20139| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nLooking at the safe neighboring moves:\n\u2003\u2013 UP from (6,6) would go to (6,7), which is occupied by my body.\n\u2003\u2013 RIGHT goes to (7,6), which is open but takes me farther from (1,6).\n\u2003\u2013 DOWN goes to (6,5), which is open but also doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any high-value apple.\n\u2003\u2013 LEFT takes me from (6,6) to (5,6). This is safe (nothing in (5,6)) and gets me closer to the apple at (1,6).\n\nSince (5,6) is within the 10\u00d710 board boundaries and avoids both my own body and the enemy snake, I\u2019ll steer toward (1,6).\n\nI decide to move: LEFT."

Given your snake\u2019s \u201cbody forest\u201d on your left, you\u2019ll ultimately need to maneuver around it. But first you need to get to an open corridor.\n\n\u2022 Examining the board and your body arrangement, your only truly safe immediate moves are UP or RIGHT. Moving UP (to (5,9)) might eventually lead you into tight spots because the top row already has several parts of snake bodies. By contrast, moving RIGHT to (6,8) immediately takes you away from your own tail\u2013giving you more room to later work around your body and look for a clear path to one of the apples.\n\nTherefore, to maintain maximum room for maneuvering and to avoid a trap in your own body, the best next move is to go RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
