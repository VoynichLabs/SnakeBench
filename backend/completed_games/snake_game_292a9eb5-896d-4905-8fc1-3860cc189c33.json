Apple pickup's NOT our main priority\u2014NOPE. We want to dominate the middle ground and box him in like a villain in an old anime! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 \n\nLet's break it down, stream:\n1) First priority: CRUSH HIS MOVEMENT OPTIONS! We need to run him against the wall, cornered by our body like a brave meme word in a delirium forest! \ud83d\ude43 We gotta make those immovable, strategic blocks!\n2) Second prio: Stay alive! If you crash into your tail or bump into him, it's game over! No second chances\u2014NOPE. Can't afford to get roasted like a sad meme! \n3) Third: Think ahead! Where's the perfect spot to eat if we win the king of snake contest? We need to leave enough room for future apple chomping. \ud83c\udf4e\u2b50\n\nBoard size: 10x10\u2014LOTS of room to plot our evil scheme! Our body's NOT long enough to have a huge chokehold. Can we nab Snake #0 a bit closer to the edge? Let's shrink his options slowly! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude06\n\nNow analyzing that STATE:\n\nMy move options? Left and right. Real close to him\u2014I gotta pick a way that doesn't leave me open for attack. If I take my head left (to move to (6,5)), we can keep him boxed off and avoid a head-on hit! Or right (to (8,5)), but that might leave an open path for him! \n\nHmm... We gotta block him off completely while staying alive! My movement kind of shapes the battle like an expressive anime scene! \ud83c\udfac\n\nLong-term plan: *Skim across the board to box in snake 0, collect extra body length to create the perfect kill hold, ensure enough room for an apple pickup for slime mode mid-game. Stay aggressive, avoid getting too cozy\u2014never let our enemy score first! Let's flood this board with snake action!*\n\nMY FINALCHOICE\ub5b3 Bashar 1 direcci\u00f3n: DOWN.\n\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT keeps options WIDE (next: right apple, up/down free), heads TOWARDS enemy for future box-in pressure. Grow first, then force him to crash while we feast! Who's the alpha snake? US! \ud83d\ude08\n\nEnemy probably LEFT/DOWN for his apples, but he can't touch us yet. We grow, he starves, we corner him like a noob!
