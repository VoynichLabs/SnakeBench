Since I'm currently at (6, 9), I can move up (y-1), down (y+1), left (x-1), or right (x+1).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. Moving up would take me closer to the apple at (9, 1), but it's further away from the apples at (2, 7) and (5, 8). Moving down would take me away from all the apples. Moving left would take me closer to the apple at (5, 8), but further away from the apples at (2, 7) and (5, 9). Moving right would take me away from the apple at (5, 8) and further away from the apples at (2, 7) and (3, 8).\n\nGiven that I want to collect as many apples as possible, the best strategy would be to move towards the apples that are currently further away. In this case, that would be the apples at (2, 7) and (5, 9). Since moving up would take me closer to the apple at (9, 1), which is closer than the other two, I'll choose to move up.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple that is furthest away, while avoiding collisions with walls, other snakes, and myself.\n\nNext move: UP (y-1)"
