No apples directly above; it might not bring us closer to targets.\n\n**Moving DOWN (to (3,7))**: Moves us downward, closer to apples at (4,2) and (4,1). It also avoids the enemy at (2,2).

The enemy snake is at (3, 7).\n\nMy possible moves from (1, 1) are:\n- UP to (1, 2): This square is empty and within bounds. Valid.\n- DOWN to (1, 0): This square is empty and within bounds. Valid.\n- LEFT to (0, 1): This square is empty and within bounds. Valid.\n- RIGHT to (2, 1): This square is occupied by my body segment. Invalid.\n\nI need to choose among UP, DOWN, and LEFT. I should aim for the closest apple that is safely reachable.\nThe apples are at (8, 6), (7, 7), (0, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2).\nCalculating Manhattan distances from (1, 1):\n- (0, 4): abs(1-0) + abs(1-4) = 1 + 3 = 4\n- (4, 1): abs(1-4) + abs(1-1) = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (4, 2): abs(1-4) + abs(1-2) = 3 + 1 = 4\n- (8, 6): abs(1-8) + abs(1-6) = 7 + 5 = 12\n- (7, 7): abs(1-7) + abs(1-7) = 6 + 6 = 12\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 1) (distance 3). The apples at (0, 4) and (4, 2) are distance 4.\n\nTo reach (4, 1), I need to move towards the right (increasing x). My body is at (2, 1), blocking a direct horizontal path on y=1.\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 0) allows me to move right towards column 4 (e.g., (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0)). From (3,0) I can move up towards y=1 or y=2. This path seems viable and avoids my body.\n- Moving UP to (1, 2) would also allow me to move right (e.g., (1,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)). This path also seems viable.\n- Moving LEFT to (0, 1) moves away from the apples at x=4 but directly towards the apple at (0, 4).\n\nLet's compare the estimated steps to reach (0, 4) vs (4, 1):\n- Path to (0, 4) starting LEFT: (1,1) -> LEFT -> (0,1) -> UP -> (0,2) -> UP -> (0,3) -> UP -> (0,4). This is 4 steps.\n- Path to (4, 1) starting DOWN: (1,1) -> DOWN -> (1,0) -> RIGHT -> (2,0) -> RIGHT -> (3,0) -> UP -> (3,1) -> RIGHT -> (4,1). This is 5 steps.\n\nThe apple at (0, 4) appears to be reachable in fewer steps from my current position than the apple at (4, 1). Both moves (LEFT or DOWN) are safe in terms of walls, my own body, and the distant enemy snake.\n\nMoving LEFT towards (0, 4) seems like a good tactical choice as it targets a relatively close apple with a clear path.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue moving LEFT, then UP towards the apple at (0, 4), being mindful of my growing body and the enemy snake's position.\n\nMy next move is LEFT.\n\nLEFT"

From there, we can plan to go down toward y=2.\n\nHowever, because moving **RIGHT** to (4,8) is safe and positions us closer to the apples at (4,2) and (4,1), and that move does not involve potential hazards, it seems a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, moving **DOWN** to (3,7) is also safe and would put us closer to the apples directly below, but perhaps less direct in approaching (4,2).\n\nBetween these options, the more strategic move to approach the cluster of apples at (4,2) and (4,1) is:\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**\n\nThis move takes us directly toward the (4,8) cell, aligning us better for the subsequent steps toward the apples at (4,2) and (4,1).\n\nNext turn, after moving RIGHT, we can plan to move down toward y=2.\n\n**Final Decision: MOVE RIGHT**"

Valid.\n\nMy valid moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow I evaluate the valid moves based on the goal of getting to the closest apple safely.\nMy head is at (1, 4).\nThe closest apple is at (4, 2) with a Manhattan distance of 5 (|1 - 4| + |4 - 2| = 3 + 2 = 5). The next closest is at (4, 1) with a distance of 6.\n\nLet's calculate the distance to (4, 2) from each valid next position:\n- Moving UP to (1, 5): Distance from (1, 5) to (4, 2) is |1 - 4| + |5 - 2| = 3 + 3 = 6. This moves me further away from the closest apple.\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 3): Distance from (1, 3) to (4, 2) is |1 - 4| + |3 - 2| = 3 + 1 = 4. This moves me closer to the closest apple.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 4): Distance from (2, 4) to (4, 2) is |2 - 4| + |4 - 2| = 2 + 2 = 4. This moves me closer to the closest apple.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT moves take me closer to the closest apple (4, 2), resulting in a distance of 4.\n\nNow consider safety. The enemy snake is at (3, 2).\n- Moving UP to (1, 5): Distance from (1, 5) to (3, 2) is |1 - 3| + |5 - 2| = 2 + 3 = 5. Safest from the enemy.\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 3): Distance from (1, 3) to (3, 2) is |1 - 3| + |3 - 2| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 4): Distance from (2, 4) to (3, 2) is |2 - 3| + |4 - 2| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nWhile moving UP is the safest in terms of immediate distance from the enemy, it moves me further from the closest food. Both DOWN and RIGHT moves put me at the same Manhattan distance (3) from the enemy.\n\nComparing DOWN and RIGHT:\nMoving DOWN to (1, 3) positions me on row 3. Subsequent moves could stay on the left side (column 1 or 2) towards the apples (4,1) and (4,2), potentially keeping more distance from the enemy's column 3.\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 4) positions me on column 2. A subsequent move right would take me into column 3 ((3,4)), which is the enemy's column.\n\nGiven that both DOWN and RIGHT bring me closer to the closest apple by the same amount, but moving DOWN allows for paths that potentially keep me further from the enemy's column (3) for a bit longer, I will choose DOWN.\n\nMy strategy is to head towards the closest apple (4, 2) or (4,1) via a path that minimizes risk from the enemy. Moving DOWN seems slightly better positioned for this.\n\nMy next move is DOWN.\n\nDOWN"

This moves me closer to (5,3).\n\nMoving RIGHT is the valid move that most directly reduces the Manhattan distance to the closest apple (5, 3).\n\nNow consider safety. The enemy snake 1 is at (6, 2) with body at (5, 2).\nMy valid moves lead to positions (3, 4), (3, 2), or (4, 3). None of these positions are currently occupied by the enemy snake's head or body.\nEnemy snake 1 can move from (6, 2) to (6, 3), (6, 1), or (7, 2). None of these potential enemy positions will cause a collision with my potential positions this turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 3) is the best step towards the closest apple (5, 3) and is safe from collisions this turn.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If the apple at (5, 3) is still available after the other snakes move, attempt to move onto it. If it's gone, re-calculate the closest apple (likely (4, 1)) and navigate towards it, prioritizing safety from collisions with walls, my own body, and enemy snakes. Continue to monitor enemy movements relative to apples.\n\nRIGHT"

I will choose LEFT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (4, 2). My body will be [(5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)]. My tail will be at (3, 3). The closest apple is now adjacent at (4, 1). I will move DOWN to (4, 1) to eat the apple, provided it is safe (not occupied by an enemy head or body segment). After eating, I will re-evaluate the board state, remaining apples, and enemy positions to determine the best move.\n\nLEFT"

Last move was RIGHT, but since we're at x=9 (the right edge), moving right again isn't possible.  \n3. Moving left from (9,2) would result in ... (8,2). Checking (8,2): it's empty and not part of our body, so moving left is safe but not directly towards any apple or strategic goal.  \n4. Moving up from (9,2) leads to (9,3), which is part of our body, so that's a collision. Cannot go up.  \n5. Moving down to (9,1) is clear, and away from walls, so it's safe. But moving down takes us away from the apple at (9,5).  \n6. The apple at (9,5) is directly above our current position. Moving up would be ideal to reach that apple quickly, but it's blocked by our body if we move up now, since (9,3) is occupied (but note that moving up from (9,2) would go to (9,3), which is part of our body, so not safe).  \n\nHold on: Our head is at (9,2), body at [(9,4), (9,3)]. Wait, the initial description said body is at [(9,4), (9,3)]. That indicates our head is at (9,2), with the body behind at positions below.  \n\nYou mentioned our last move was UP, and that the head is now at (9,2). But the last move was UP? That suggests it moved from (9,1) to (9,2).  \n\nBut earlier, the last move info says the snake was at (9,2). Or is this a confusion?  \n\nDouble-check:  \n- Your last move was UP. That means your head moved from (9,1) to (9,2).  \n- Your body is at [(9,4), (9,3)], meaning your tail is at (9,4), rest of the body at (9,3).  \n\nIf your current head is at (9,2), but your body is at [(9,4), (9,3)], then your snake occupies only (9,2). Your tail part is at (9,4), with (9,3) in the body? Probably, there's a mistake; maybe the code or info is inconsistent?  \n\nAssuming the head is at (9,2) and body is at [(9,4), (9,3)], then the snake length is 3: head at (9,2), body at (9,4) and (9,3).  \n\nBut normally, the body is in order: head first, tail last: [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4)]?  \n\nAnyway, focusing on the current cell: the head at (9,2).  \n- Moving UP to (9,3) would collide with the snake's own body at (9,3), so move invalid.  \n- Moving DOWN to (9,1): safe, no obstacle.  \n- Moving LEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacle.  \n- Moving RIGHT is impossible (x=9 edge).  \n\nConsidering the proximity to the apple at (9,5), moving up is the goal, but it's blocked. Our safest move now is to go down to (9,1).  \n\nNext turn, from (9,1), we can move UP again to approach (9,5).  \n\nAlso, since the apple at (8,6) and (7,7) are off to the left, and apples at (0,5), (2,5), and (2,9) are further, the closest high-value apple is at (9,5), directly above.\n\n**Summary of decision logic:**\n\n- Moving UP from (9,2) is blocked by our own body at (9,3).  \n- Moving down to (9,1) is safe.  \n- Moving left to (8,2) is safe but takes us away from the apple.  \n\nGiven this, the best immediate action is to move **DOWN** to (9,1), then in subsequent moves, approach the apple at (9,5).  \n\n**Next move:** **DOWN**"

The apples are at (8, 6), (7, 7), (0, 5), (2, 5), (2, 9).\nCalculating the Manhattan distance from my current head position (3, 1) to each apple:\n- To (8, 6): |3-8| + |1-6| = 5 + 5 = 10\n- To (7, 7): |3-7| + |1-7| = 4 + 6 = 10\n- To (0, 5): |3-0| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- To (2, 5): |3-2| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (2, 9): |3-2| + |1-9| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 5) with a distance of 5.\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves and how they affect the distance to (2, 5):\n- Move UP to (3, 2): The distance from (3, 2) to (2, 5) is |3-2| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4. (Decreases distance)\n- Move DOWN to (3, 0): The distance from (3, 0) to (2, 5) is |3-2| + |0-5| = 1 + 5 = 6. (Increases distance)\n- Move LEFT to (2, 1): The distance from (2, 1) to (2, 5) is |2-2| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4. (Decreases distance)\n\nBoth UP and LEFT moves decrease the distance to the closest apple (2, 5). Both moves are currently safe.\nConsidering the flexibility for the next turn and aligning with the apple's coordinates, moving LEFT to (2, 1) seems slightly preferable as it puts me directly below the apple's x-coordinate (2) and offers more potential valid moves next turn compared to moving UP to (3,2) which is adjacent to several of my body segments.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (2, 1). My body will be [(3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)]. The apples remaining are (8, 6), (7, 7), (0, 5), (2, 5), (2, 9). I will find the closest apple from my new head position, assess safety, and move towards it.\n\nThe optimal move is to move LEFT to get closer to the apple at (2, 5) and maintain future flexibility.\n\nLEFT"

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation step-by-step:\n\n1. Our snake's body is at [(9,4), (9,3)] with head at (9,2).  \n2. Last move was RIGHT, but since we're at x=9 (the right edge), moving right again isn't possible.  \n3. Moving left from (9,2) would result in ... (8,2). Checking (8,2): it's empty and not part of our body, so moving left is safe but not directly towards any apple or strategic goal.  \n4. Moving up from (9,2) leads to (9,3), which is part of our body, so that's a collision. Cannot go up.  \n5. Moving down to (9,1) is clear, and away from walls, so it's safe. But moving down takes us away from the apple at (9,5).  \n6. The apple at (9,5) is directly above our current position. Moving up would be ideal to reach that apple quickly, but it's blocked by our body if we move up now, since (9,3) is occupied (but note that moving up from (9,2) would go to (9,3), which is part of our body, so not safe).  \n\nHold on: Our head is at (9,2), body at [(9,4), (9,3)]. Wait, the initial description said body is at [(9,4), (9,3)]. That indicates our head is at (9,2), with the body behind at positions below.  \n\nYou mentioned our last move was UP, and that the head is now at (9,2). But the last move was UP? That suggests it moved from (9,1) to (9,2).  \n\nBut earlier, the last move info says the snake was at (9,2). Or is this a confusion?  \n\nDouble-check:  \n- Your last move was UP. That means your head moved from (9,1) to (9,2).  \n- Your body is at [(9,4), (9,3)], meaning your tail is at (9,4), rest of the body at (9,3).  \n\nIf your current head is at (9,2), but your body is at [(9,4), (9,3)], then your snake occupies only (9,2). Your tail part is at (9,4), with (9,3) in the body? Probably, there's a mistake; maybe the code or info is inconsistent?  \n\nAssuming the head is at (9,2) and body is at [(9,4), (9,3)], then the snake length is 3: head at (9,2), body at (9,4) and (9,3).  \n\nBut normally, the body is in order: head first, tail last: [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4)]?  \n\nAnyway, focusing on the current cell: the head at (9,2).  \n- Moving UP to (9,3) would collide with the snake's own body at (9,3), so move invalid.  \n- Moving DOWN to (9,1): safe, no obstacle.  \n- Moving LEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacle.  \n- Moving RIGHT is impossible (x=9 edge).  \n\nConsidering the proximity to the apple at (9,5), moving up is the goal, but it's blocked. Our safest move now is to go down to (9,1).  \n\nNext turn, from (9,1), we can move UP again to approach (9,5).  \n\nAlso, since the apple at (8,6) and (7,7) are off to the left, and apples at (0,5), (2,5), and (2,9) are further, the closest high-value apple is at (9,5), directly above.\n\n**Summary of decision logic:**\n\n- Moving UP from (9,2) is blocked by our own body at (9,3).  \n- Moving down to (9,1) is safe.  \n- Moving left to (8,2) is safe but takes us away from the apple.  \n\nGiven this, the best immediate action is to move **DOWN** to (9,1), then in subsequent moves, approach the apple at (9,5).  \n\n**Next move:** **DOWN**"
