I have no body segments.\nSnake 0 is at (3, 8).\n\nApples are at: (1, 4), (7, 3), (4, 5), (7, 9), (2, 5).\n\nMy snake's head is (8, 5).\nPossible moves: UP to (8, 6), DOWN to (8, 4), LEFT to (7, 5), RIGHT to (9, 5).\n\n1. **Check for immediate death:**\n   * No immediate dangers (off board, self-collision, or collision with enemy body/head). All four directions are safe this turn as there is no body, and Snake 0 is far away.\n\n2. **Evaluate safe moves:**\n   I am targeting the apples on the y=5 line: (4, 5) [4 units away] and (2, 5) [6 units away].\n\n   * **LEFT (7, 5):** Moves directly towards (4, 5). Distance shortens by 1 unit. This is the optimal move for approaching the closest apple.\n   * **RIGHT (9, 5):** Moves back towards the wall and away from all nearby apples. Bad.\n   * **UP (8, 6):** Moves away from all apples except possibly (7, 9), distance to which becomes 4 (dx=-1, dy=+3, manhattan 4). This move is decent if I want to switch targets, but (4, 5) is closer and easier to reach.\n   * **DOWN (8, 4):** Moves away from (4, 5) and (2, 5). Moves closer to (7, 3) (distance 2, dx=-1, dy=-1). This is competitive.\n\n3. **Compare LEFT and DOWN:**\n   * **Target (4, 5):** Currently 4 units away. Moving LEFT makes it 3 units away.\n   * **Target (7, 3):** Currently 3 units away. Moving DOWN makes it 2 units away.\n\n   Both targets are highly efficient. The apple (4, 5) is slightly more central and moving LEFT keeps options open for (2, 5) as well. Moving DOWN commits me more to the lower part of the board and potentially away from Snake 0's path, but Snake 0 is currently high up and moving towards the apple (7, 9) may be its priority due to its current proximity.\n\n   Let's check Snake 0: Head at (3, 8). Closest apples are (4, 5) (distance 2) and (7, 9) (distance 5). It is likely aiming for (4, 5) or (2, 5) depending on its strategy, or maybe (7, 9) for high Y.\n   * If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (4, 8), it is 4 units from (8, 5). It directly targets (4, 5).\n   * If Snake 0 moves UP to (3, 9), it is 5 units from (7, 9).\n   * If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (3, 7), it starts moving away from (7, 9) and (4, 5).\n\n   If Snake 0 moves RIGHT (4, 8), it poses a threat to the (4, 5) apple race.\n   My current position (8, 5). If I move LEFT (7, 5).\n   The distance I must cover to (4, 5) is 3 moves.\n   The distance Snake 0 must cover to (4, 5) is 3 moves (R, D, D or R, R, D).\n\n   Since Snake 0 is also close to (4, 5), I should prioritize the quickest path, which is LEFT. It is highly likely Snake 0 will also move towards (4, 5), perhaps moving RIGHT to (4, 8).\n\n   By moving LEFT (7, 5), I maintain the most aggressive approach toward the most contested apple (4, 5). If I deviate to (7, 3), I concede (4, 5) potentially to Snake 0.\n\n4. **Strategic Choice:** Continue moving LEFT toward (4, 5).\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving left (7, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 5). This apple is contested, but it provides the quickest growth opportunity.\n\nLEFT",

(The previous board state showed Snake 0 at (3, 7). This means Snake 0 moved from (3, 8) or (2, 7) or (4, 7) or (3, 6) in Turn 1. The previous rationale mentioned Snake 0 was at (3, 8), so its move was DOWN).\n\nApples are at: (1, 4), (7, 3), (4, 5), (7, 9), (2, 5).\n\nMy snake's head is (7, 5).\nPossible moves: UP to (7, 6), DOWN to (7, 4), LEFT to (6, 5), RIGHT to (8, 5).\n\n1. **Check for immediate death:**\n   * Board is 10x10. I am at (7, 5). All four moves are safe regarding walls.\n   * I have no body, so no self-collision.\n   * Snake 0 is at (3, 7). No immediate collision risk with Snake 0's current position.\n\n2. **Evaluate safe moves regarding apples and opponent:**\n   The closest apples are:\n   * (7, 3): (dx=0, dy=-2), Manhattan distance 2.\n   * (4, 5): (dx=-3, dy=0), Manhattan distance 3. (Contested)\n\n   Snake 0 is at (3, 7). Snake 0 is closest to (4, 5) (distance 1+2=3) and (2, 5) (distance 1+2=3).\n\n   * **LEFT (6, 5):** Direct path towards (4, 5). Distance to (4, 5) becomes 2. This is the continuation of the previous plan.\n   * **DOWN (7, 4):** Moves towards (7, 3). Distance to (7, 3) becomes 1. This is a very strong candidate as it guarantees the apple next turn if Snake 0 doesn't interfere, which is unlikely as Snake 0 is far away high up.\n   * **UP (7, 6):** Moves slightly away from (4, 5) and (7, 3). Moves closer to (7, 9) (distance 3).\n   * **RIGHT (8, 5):** Moves away from all close apples. Bad.\n\n3. **Compare LEFT and DOWN:**\n\n   * **LEFT (Target (4, 5)):** (6, 5). Distance 2. Snake 0 is at (3, 7). If Snake 0 moves (R, D, D) or (D, R, R), it can reach (4, 5) in minimal 3 moves. If Snake 0 moves R to (4, 7), it's 3 moves away. If I move LEFT, I will reach (4, 5) in 2 moves (Turn 4). Snake 0 is likely moving towards (4, 5) or (2, 5) or maybe even (7, 9).\n\n   * **DOWN (Target (7, 3)):** (7, 4). Distance 1. I will eat this apple on Turn 3. This apple is currently uncontested. Snake 0 is 3 units away from (7, 3) (R, D, D or D, D, R etc.). It is very unlikely Snake 0 will prioritize this apple since it is equally close to two other apples, (4, 5) and (2, 5).\n\n4. **Strategic Decision:**\n   While (4, 5) is important for central control, going for the sure apple (7, 3) is safer and faster. Securing the first apple quickly is a priority.\n\n   If I move DOWN to (7, 4), I position myself perfectly for the apple at (7, 3) next turn. Snake 0 is at (3, 7) and currently prioritizing moving towards the center or up to (7, 9).\n\n   Let's project Snake 0's move:\n   (3, 7). Optimal moves are towards (4, 5) or (2, 5) (Distance 3 to both) or towards (7, 9) (Distance 4).\n   - If Snake 0 moves R to (4, 7) -> sets up for (4, 5) race.\n   - If Snake 0 moves D to (3, 6) -> sets up for (2, 5) or (1, 4).\n\n   If I move DOWN, I secure (7, 3) next turn. If I move LEFT, I enter a race for (4, 5) which I might lose, or which might force a suboptimal path later.\n\n   Prioritizing the guaranteed apple (7, 3) is the best immediate strategy.\n\nLong-term plan: Secure (7, 3) on turn 3. After that, assess the board state. Maybe move towards (1, 4) or swing back up towards (4, 5) if it is still available. Since (7, 3) is low, moving towards (1, 4) (distance 6 now) might be natural.\n\nDOWN",

All moves are safely within bounds.\n   * I have no body, so no self-collision.\n   * Snake 0 is at (3, 8).\n   * **Collision Check:** I need to ensure my chosen move doesn't land on or crash head-to-head with Snake 0's next position. Snake 0 is 4 units away in X and 4 units away in Y. There is no risk of immediate collision.\n\n2. **Evaluate safe moves regarding apples:**\n\n   * **DOWN (7, 3):** This cell contains an apple. Moving DOWN secures the first apple and gives me length 2. This is the optimal move.\n   * **UP (7, 5):** Moves away from all nearby uncontested apples.\n   * **LEFT (6, 4):** Moves slightly closer to (4, 5) (distance 3).\n   * **RIGHT (8, 4):** Moves away from apples.\n\n3. **Strategic Decision:**\n   Moving DOWN to (7, 3) immediately secures an apple. This was the planned move from the previous turn, and it is still the best move.\n\n4. **Post-move analysis (Mental projection for Turn 4 start):**\n   My snake will be at (7, 3) and have a body segment at (7, 4). New apples will likely spawn, or the existing ones will remain: (1, 4), (4, 5), (7, 9), (2, 5). I will then be closest to (4, 5) (distance 3+1=4) or (2, 5) (distance 5) or (1, 4) (distance 6).\n\n   Snake 0 is currently at (3, 8). Its movement priority is likely (4, 5) or (2, 5) or (7, 9).\n   If Snake 0 moves, for example, towards (4, 5) via DOWN/RIGHT or RIGHT/DOWN, it might be competitive for (4, 5).\n\nSince DOWN is an immediate apple grab and safe, it is the clear choice.\n\n*Long-term plan:* After reaching (7, 3) and gaining length, I will evaluate the enemy's position and target the nearest uncontested apple. The central apple (4, 5) is important, but if Snake 0 is racing for it, I might swing left towards (1, 4) or (2, 5) if they are still reachable.\n\nDOWN",

Available Moves and Immediate Death Check:**\nThe board is 10x10 (0-9).\n*   **UP (7, 4):** Moves onto my own body segment (the tail). **FATAL.** Self-collision.\n*   **DOWN (7, 2):** Safe, within bounds.\n*   **LEFT (6, 3):** Safe, within bounds.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 3):** Safe, within bounds.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Apple Proximity and Strategy:**\n\nThe closest apples to (7, 3) are:\nA1: (8, 6) -> Manhattan distance: |8-7| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4. (Right and Up)\nA2: (4, 5) -> Manhattan distance: |4-7| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5.

(Straight Up)\n\n**Enemy Snake #0 position:** (4, 8).\nSnake 0 is likely moving towards (7, 9) (D: 3) or (4, 5) (D: 3).\n\n*   If Snake 0 moves towards (7, 9): It would likely move RIGHT (5, 8), then (6, 8), then (7, 8). This is the shortest path for Snake 0 to an apple.\n*   If Snake 0 moves towards (4, 5): It would likely move DOWN (4, 7), then (4, 6), then (4, 5).\n\nI need to secure one of the apples that Snake 0 is less likely to reach first, or race aggressively for a nearby apple.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **RIGHT (8, 3):** Moves 1 unit closer to (8, 6). Next turns could be (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6). This path takes ~4-5 turns.\n*   **LEFT (6, 3):** Moves towards the center. Closer to (4, 5) (D: 4).\n*   **DOWN (7, 2):** Moves away from all appealing apples. This is usually reserved for safety or stalling.\n\n**Race Assessment:**\n\n1. **Target (8, 6):** My distance is 4.\n   - If I move RIGHT: (8, 3) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 6). Takes 3 more turns (total 4). This seems fast and safe.\n\n2. **Target (4, 5):** My distance is 5.\n   - If I move LEFT: (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 5). Takes 4 more turns (total 5).\n   - Snake 0 distance is 3. Snake 0 is likely moving (4, 7) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 5). Snake 0 will reach (4, 5) in 3 turns. I cannot win this race safely unless Snake 0 decides to go for (7, 9).\n\n3. **Target (7, 9):** My distance is 6.\n   - Snake 0 distance is 3. Snake 0 will definitely win this race if it chooses that direction.\n\n**Conclusion:** The apple (8, 6) is the easiest and safest to target. If I move RIGHT, I directly start the path: (7, 3) $\\to$ (8, 3).\n\n**3. Collision Check (RIGHT move to (8, 3)):**\n\n*   My new head position: (8, 3).\n*   My new body remains safe: (7, 4).\n*   Snake 0 is at (4, 8). Snake 0 is 5 units away from (8, 3). There is no possibility of a head-on collision or collision with Snake 0's future body this turn, as Snake 0 has no body and is far away.\n\nThe path RIGHT to (8, 3) is safe and efficient for apple collection.\n\n***\n**Long-term strategy note for Turn 5 onward:**\nTarget (8, 6). If I move RIGHT now, I will be at (8, 3). Next move should be UP towards (8, 6). I expect to secure this apple in 3-4 turns. Simultaneously monitor Snake 0's movements. If Snake 0 goes for (7, 9), then (4, 5) or (2, 5) might open up later. If Snake 0 goes for (4, 5), I should stick to (8, 6) for now.\n***\n\nRIGHT",

(1, 5) - Distance 7 (7 left, 1 down).\n5.  (1, 4) - Distance 8 (7 left, 2 down).\n\n*   **Snake #0 Analysis:** Head at (5, 9). The closest apple to Snake #0 is (7, 9) (Distance 2). Snake #0 is likely to move RIGHT to (6, 9) or (7, 9).\n    *   If Snake #0 moves RIGHT $\\to$ (6, 9) $\\to$ RIGHT $\\to$ (7, 9), it gets the apple in 2 turns.\n    *   If Snake #0 moves UP/DOWN/LEFT, it moves away from the only nearby apple.\n    *   $P(\\text{Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (6, 9)}) \\approx 80\\%$.\n\n*   **My Goal:** I need to pivot away from the edge (8, 6) and move towards the cluster of apples (1, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5) and (1, 4).\n\n*   **Option UP (8, 7):** Moves me closer to Snake #0's territory and potential target (7, 9). While Snake #0 is likely going for (7, 9), moving up keeps me further from the main cluster and risks interference.\n*   **Option LEFT (7, 6):** Moves me left, initiating the path toward the center apples. This is a good maneuvering move.\n*   **Option RIGHT (9, 6):** Moves me onto the edge, potentially limiting future moves (e.g., if I moved to (9, 5) next, I'd have only 3 move options), and away from the apple cluster. Less desirable.\n\n**3. Comparison and Decision:**\n\nMoving LEFT (7, 6) opens up paths DOWN (to 7, 5) and further LEFT (to 6, 6) in subsequent turns, allowing me to eventually converge on (4, 5) or (2, 5).\n\n*   If I move LEFT to (7, 6):\n    *   New Head: (7, 6). Body: [(8, 6), (8, 5)].\n    *   Next turn, I can move LEFT (6, 6) or DOWN (7, 5). Both are good paths towards the center.\n\n*   If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6, 9), its head is still far away. No immediate collision risk.\n\nMoving LEFT is the optimal move to reposition myself favorably for the next cluster of apples.\n\n***\n**Long-term Strategy Note for Turn 9 onward:**\nCurrent head (8, 6). Moving LEFT to (7, 6). Next turn, I will prioritize moving LEFT again to (6, 6) or DOWN to (7, 5) to approach the central apples (4, 5) and (2, 5). I should try to curve around my existing body segments (8, 6, 8, 5, 8, 4). The path LEFT $\\to$ DOWN $\\to$ LEFT $\\to$ ... seems appropriate for reaching the (4, 5) area.\n***\n\nLEFT",

(2, 5): Manhattan distance 5 (5 left, 1 down).\n    3.

Move Comparison (From (7, 6)):**\n\n*   **Option UP (7, 7):** Moves closer to enemy Snake #0 and the more distant apple (7, 9). This apple is strategically less important for me right now than the cluster, and pursuing it risks collision or a long detour.\n*   **Option DOWN (7, 5):** Moves one step closer to the (4, 5) line (y=5). This is a good maneuvering move, opening up LEFT or DOWN again next turn.\n*   **Option LEFT (6, 6):** Moves one step closer to the cluster along x-axis. This is also a strong move, setting up a DOWN or LEFT move next turn.\n\n**Comparing LEFT (6, 6) and DOWN (7, 5):**\n\n| Move | New Head | Distance to (4, 5) | Path Flexibility |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| LEFT | (6, 6) | D=3 (2L, 1D) | High. Can go DOWN (6, 5) or LEFT (5, 6). |\n| DOWN | (7, 5) | D=3 (3L, 0D) | High. Can go LEFT (6, 5) or DOWN (7, 4). |\n\nBoth moves result in the same physical distance to the target (4, 5) (3 steps). However, moving DOWN (7, 5) immediately puts us on the y-coordinate line of three apples (4, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5). From (7, 5), we can move LEFT to (6, 5) then (5, 5) then (4, 5) in 3 turns.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (6, 6), then DOWN to (6, 5), then LEFT to (5, 5), then LEFT to (4, 5) in 4 turns.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7, 5) seems marginally better as it immediately positions us on the correct y-level (y=5) of the apple cluster, allowing us to sweep left towards (4, 5).\n\n**4. Collision Check (DOWN to (7, 5)):**\nSnake #0 is at (5, 8).\nIf Snake #0 goes LEFT (4, 8), the distance is large.\nIf Snake #0 goes DOWN (5, 7), the distance is large.\nIf Snake #0 goes RIGHT (6, 8), the distance is large.\nThere is no immediate collision risk from moving to (7, 5).\n\n**Decision:** Choose DOWN to position the snake on the y=5 level for direct advancement towards the apple cluster on the left.\n\n***\n**Long-term Strategy Note for Turn 10 onward:**\nMoved DOWN to (7, 5). Next turn, I will move LEFT to (6, 5) to continue approaching (4, 5). I need to be aware of Snake #0 potentially moving towards this area (e.g., if it moves (5, 8) $\\to$ (5, 7) $\\to$ (4, 7)). My current path (7, 5) $\\to$ (6, 5) $\\to$ (5, 5) $\\to$ (4, 5) is safe and efficient for eating the first available apple in this cluster.\n***\n\nDOWN",

Moves away from apples.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Targets and Strategy:**\n\nWe successfully navigated to y=5, which is the line containing three close apples: (4, 5), (2, 5), and (1, 5). The primary goal is to move along this line towards the cluster.\n\n*   **Closest Apple on Y=5 Line:** (4, 5), Distance 3 (3 left).\n*   **Enemy Snake #0 Analysis:** Head at (6, 8).\n    *   Targets for #0: (7, 9) (D=2: 1R, 1U) or the cluster on y=5 (e.g., (4, 5), D=5: 2L, 3D).\n    *   Possible moves for #0: UP (6, 9), DOWN (6, 7), LEFT (5, 8), RIGHT (7, 8).\n    *   If #0 moves UP (6, 9) or RIGHT (7, 8), it aims for (7, 9).\n    *   If #0 moves DOWN (6, 7) or LEFT (5, 8), it starts moving towards the center cluster.\n\n**3. Move Comparison (From (7, 5)):**\n\n*   **Option RIGHT (8, 5):** Moves away from all near apples. Bad.\n*   **Option DOWN (7, 4):** Moves one step closer to (1, 4). This move is orthogonal to the main cluster line (y=5). If we go DOWN, we step off the line of three apples. It sets up an inefficient path (DOWN, then LEFT, then UP, then LEFT...) compared to staying on y=5.\n*   **Option LEFT (6, 5):** This is the direct path along the apple line towards (4, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5). From (6, 5), we can immediately move LEFT again next turn towards (4, 5). This is the optimal approach for the close apple cluster.\n\n**4. Collision Check (LEFT to (6, 5)):**\n\n*   My move: (7, 5) $\\to$ (6, 5).\n*   Snake #0 is at (6, 8). No head-on collision possible.\n*   Snake #0's body is none.\n*   My body is now at (7, 6) and (8, 6). Safe.\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 5) maintains the momentum towards the primary target cluster and keeps the snake safe.\n\n***\n**Long-term Strategy Note for Turn 11 onward:**\nI am at (6, 5), targeting (4, 5). I will continue moving LEFT to (5, 5), then (4, 5) (eating the apple). After that, I will continue along y=5 to eat (2, 5) and (1, 5). I must monitor Snake #0's descent if it chooses to compete for the central area.\n***\nLEFT",

This means #0 will not interfere with the cluster on y=5 next turn.\n\n**3.

No immediate benefit.\n*   **Option DOWN (6, 4):** Moves one step closer to (1, 4). This move leaves the y=5 apple cluster line. While (1, 4) is a valid future target, we have three consecutive apples on y=5 we can consume immediately. Deviating now is inefficient.\n*   **Option LEFT (5, 5):** This is the optimal move. It advances directly towards (4, 5).\n\n**4. Collision Check (LEFT to (5, 5)):**\n\n*   My move: (6, 5) $\\to$ (5, 5).\n*   Snake #0 is expected to move to (7, 9). No collision threat.\n*   My body safety: (5, 5) is safe.\n\nLEFT is the clear choice to maintain momentum and capture the apple cluster.\n\n***\n**Long-term Strategy Note for Turn 12 onward:**\nContinue moving LEFT along y=5 to collect apples (4, 5), (2, 5), and (1, 5). After collecting (1, 5), consider dropping down to collect (1, 4). Monitor Snake #0, which is likely eating (7, 9) this turn.\n***\nLEFT",

The important thing is its current location.)\n\n**Visualization (Turn 13):**\n\nMy snake (ID 1): H=(4, 5), B=[(5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5)]\nEnemy snake (ID 0): H=(7, 6)\nApples: (1, 4), (7, 9), (2, 5), (1, 5), (6, 3)\n\n$\\begin{array}{llllllllll}\n 9 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & A & . \\\\\n 8 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\\\\n 7 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\\\\n 6 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & 0 & . \\\\\n 5 & . & A & A & . & H & T & T & T & . \\\\\n 4 & . & A & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\\\\n 3 & . & . & . & . & . & . & A & . & . \\\\\n 2 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\\\\n 1 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\\\\n 0 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\\\\n   & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9\n\\end{array}$\n(Note: $H=(4, 5)$. T's are (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5). Apples are (1, 5), (2, 5), (1, 4), (6, 3), (7, 9).)\n\n**1. Available Moves and Immediate Death Check (from (4, 5)):**\n\n*   **UP (4, 6):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN (4, 4):** Safe. Moves toward (1, 4).\n*   **LEFT (3, 5):** Safe. Moves directly toward apples (2, 5) and (1, 5).\n*   **RIGHT (5, 5):** Moves into my body segment (5, 5). **FATAL** (moving backwards).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Enemy Snake #0 Prediction (Head at (7, 6)):**\n#0 is at (7, 6).\n*   Apples nearby: (7, 9) (UP 3 steps), (6, 3) (LEFT 1, DOWN 3).\n*   Since #0 is small and far from me, and (7, 9) is its closest apple in terms of straight distance, #0 will likely move UP (7, 7) or possibly LEFT (6, 6) towards (6, 3). If it moved from (7, 7) to (7, 6) last turn, it might prefer moving back UP towards (7, 9).\n\nNo immediate collision threat from #0.\n\n**3. Evaluate Targets and Strategy:**\n\nMy immediate goal is to continue collecting the clustered apples along the y=5 line: (2, 5) and (1, 5).\n\n*   **Option LEFT (3, 5):** Excellent. Proceeds directly toward (2, 5). This is the continuation of the current successful strategy.\n*   **Option UP (4, 6):** Moves away from all immediate apples. Poor choice.\n*   **Option DOWN (4, 4):** Moves toward (1, 4) but sacrifices the path to (2, 5) and (1, 5). While (1, 4) is appealing, finishing the (y=5) cluster first is more efficient, as it requires fewer turns and makes us longer, potentially trapping #0 later.\n\nMoving LEFT towards (3, 5) maintains the high-gain path.\n\n**4. Collision Check (LEFT to (3, 5)):**\nThe target cell (3, 5) is empty.\nNo collision risk with walls or other snakes.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving LEFT along y=5 to collect (2, 5) and (1, 5). After collecting those, evaluate the state. The next likely targets are (1, 4) or potentially looping up or down if the board perimeter is safer than the center. Given our length, maintaining open movement space is key.\n\nLEFT",

Increases length and score. Excellent move.\n*   **Option UP (3, 6):** Moves away from all immediate apples, possibly towards the enemy near (6, 6).\n*   **Option DOWN (3, 4):** Moves toward the apple at (1, 4), but sacrifices the immediate apple (2, 5).\n\nMoving LEFT is clearly the optimal choice.\n\n**3. Enemy Snake #0 Prediction (Head at (6, 6)):**\n#0 is at (6, 6).\nClosest apples for #0: (6, 3) (DOWN 3 steps), (7, 9) (UP 3, RIGHT 1).\n#0 will likely prioritize (6, 3) due to fewer diagonal/off-axis moves, or possibly move toward the center (e.g., DOWN to (6, 5) or LEFT to (5, 6)). Given our body is at (6, 5) and (5, 5), if #0 moves DOWN to (6, 5), it hits my tail segment! Wait, my current body segments are (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5). If #0 moves DOWN to (6, 5), it hits my tail segment (6, 5) and dies, and I continue to grow, as long as I do not move into its current location (6, 6).\n\nSince I am moving to (2, 5), I am far away from #0, and there is no risk of a head-on collision or crashing into its body.\n\n**4. Collision Check (LEFT to (2, 5)):**\nThe target cell (2, 5) is an apple.\nNo collision risk with walls or other snakes.\n\nThis is a defensive and offensive move, ensuring immediate growth.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating (2, 5), I will be at (2, 5). The next apple is (1, 5). I will move LEFT again to (1, 5). After that, the apple (1, 4) is easily reachable with a DOWN move. I will focus on maximizing growth in the bottom left quadrant before navigating the rest of the board.\n\nLEFT",
