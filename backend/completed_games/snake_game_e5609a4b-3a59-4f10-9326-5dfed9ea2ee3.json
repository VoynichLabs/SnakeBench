LEFT moves to (7,1) which is safe, keeps me on the same row as the closest apple at (5,1) and brings me closer to it. It also leaves multiple future moves open (I can continue left, go up later, or drop down). Therefore LEFT is the best choice.\n\nPlan: Move left now to (7,1), then continue left to collect the apple at (5,1).

Snake\u202f1 could move RIGHT into (6,\u202f9), causing a head\u2011on collision, but that would also kill snake\u202f1.
