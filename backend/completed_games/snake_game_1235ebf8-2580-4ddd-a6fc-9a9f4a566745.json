No immediate head-on collision risk with my safe moves, as moving LEFT to (5,5) avoids their current position and potential paths this turn (they'd need to go UP twice or something unlikely for direct collision now).\n\nPrioritizing proximity to reachable apples: LEFT moves me directly toward (4,5) and ultimately (2,5), while keeping options open to circle down or adjust after eating. UP or DOWN move away from those left-side apples, potentially toward scattered ones like (9,9) or (6,2) which might be contested or farther. LEFT also maintains multiple escape routes (e.g., down to row 4 or up/backtrack) without narrowing into dead ends, and the board has open space left/down.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**  \nPrioritize collecting (4,5) and then (2,5) if possible, aiming for at least tying or surpassing enemy apples (they have 2, you have 1, game ends in 1 turn). From (5,5) next, move LEFT to (4,5) to eat; this will grow you to 2 segments, complicating enemy if heading up. After eating, assess enemy position\u2014 if they veer right/up (toward (6,2) or higher), weave down toward (2,5) or other left apples like (3,6)/(1,6); avoid upward paths that might trap you.
