The next closest is `(7, 6)` (distance = sqrt(2) \u2248 1.414 units diagonally), followed by `(6, 0)` (distance = 4 units down), `(8, 8)` (distance = sqrt(41) \u2248 6.4 units), and `(9, 1)` (distance = sqrt(37) \u2248 6.08 units).\n\n**Safe Moves:**\nFrom `(6, 4)`, the four possible moves are:\n1. **UP**: `(6, 5)` (valid, no collision)\n2. **DOWN**: `(6, 3)` (valid, lands on apple at `(6, 3)`)\n3. **LEFT**: `(5, 4)` (valid, no collision)\n4. **RIGHT**: `(7, 4)` (valid, no collision)\n\n**Enemy Movement Considerations:**\n- Enemy snake at `(1, 8)` has no body, so it can move freely. It may try to block or chase you, but since it's far away, immediate risk is low.\n- No overlap in movement paths yet, but we should avoid moves that could lead to future collisions.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **DOWN**: Directly to the apple at `(6, 3)`. This is the safest and most optimal move for immediate gain (1 apple, length increase).\n- **UP/LEFT/RIGHT**: No immediate apple, but may be useful for positioning for future apples.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:**\n- Prioritize apples closest to the head to grow quickly.\n- Avoid getting trapped in corners or tight spaces.\n- Watch enemy movements to avoid collisions.\n\n### **Decision:**\nThe best move is **DOWN** to immediately collect the apple at `(6, 3)`. This increases the snake's length and score while keeping future options open.\n\n---\n**Long-term plan for future moves:**\n- After growing, explore directions toward `(7, 6)` and `(6, 0)` for next apples.\n- Avoid moving into positions where the enemy could block or collide with us.\n- If the enemy starts moving aggressively, prioritize moves that keep distance or create space.\n\n---\nDOWN",

This means the enemy is moving aggressively toward the center of the board.\n- If the enemy moves **DOWN** from `(8, 8)`, their head will move to `(8, 7)`, which is adjacent to your current head at `(8, 1)` (but not directly threatening yet).\n- If the enemy moves **LEFT** or **RIGHT**, they could potentially block your path to `(9, 1)` or `(9, 7)`.\n\n**Apple Prioritization:**\nThe closest apples to your head at `(8, 1)` are:\n1. `(9, 1)` (distance = 1 unit right).\n2. `(9, 7)` (distance = 6 units diagonally).\n3. `(7, 6)` (distance = 5 units up-left).\n4. `(4, 1)` (distance = 4 units left).\n\nThe closest apple is now `(9, 1)` (1 unit away), which is directly to the right of your head. This is a high-priority target.\n\n**Safe Moves:**\nFrom `(8, 1)`, the four possible moves are:\n1. **UP**: `(8, 2)` (valid, no collision).\n2. **DOWN**: `(8, 0)` (valid, but this is outside the board if we consider y-coordinates from 0 to 9. `(8, 0)` is valid since y=0 is the bottom-left corner. However, this would be moving downward, but `(8, 0)` is not part of your body. Wait, no: `(8, 0)` is valid, but it's not part of your body. Your body is at `(7, 1)`, `(7, 0)`, `(6, 0)`. So `(8, 0)` is not part of your body. But is it safe? Yes, no collision with your body or enemy.\n   - However, moving down to `(8, 0)` is not optimal for reaching `(9, 1)`.\n3. **LEFT**: `(7, 1)` (invalid, this is part of your body\u2014**self-collision**).\n   - **Eliminate LEFT.**\n4. **RIGHT**: `(9, 1)` (valid, this is an apple!).\n\n**Enemy Movement Considerations:**\n- The enemy is at `(8, 8)` with body at `(7, 8)`. Their possible moves:\n  - **UP**: `(8, 9)` (invalid, off the board).\n  - **DOWN**: `(8, 7)` (valid, no collision with your snake yet).\n  - **LEFT**: `(7, 8)` (invalid, this is their own body).\n  - **RIGHT**: `(9, 8)` (valid, no collision with your snake yet).\n\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to `(8, 7)`, they could block your path to `(9, 7)` or `(9, 8)` in the future.\nIf the enemy moves **RIGHT** to `(9, 8)`, they could block your path to `(9, 1)` if you try to go up to `(9, 2)` or similar.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **UP**: `(8, 2)` is safe but does not help in reaching `(9, 1)` immediately.\n- **DOWN**: `(8, 0)` is safe but not optimal for reaching `(9, 1)`.\n- **RIGHT**: `(9, 1)` is safe and directly eats the apple, growing your snake to length 4 and increasing your score to 4.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:**\n- Eating the apple at `(9, 1)` is the best immediate move, as it grows your snake and increases your score.\n- After eating the apple, you will be at `(9, 1)` with body `[(8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0)]`.\n- Next, prioritize moving toward the apple at `(9, 7)` or `(7, 6)` to continue growing.\n- Watch the enemy's movements closely, as they are now length 2 and could become a threat if they move aggressively toward your path.\n\n### **Decision:**\nThe best move is **RIGHT** to `(9, 1)` to eat the apple, grow your snake, and increase your score. This is a high-priority move that maximizes immediate growth.\n\n---\n**Long-term plan for future moves:**\n- After eating the apple at `(9, 1)`, prioritize moving toward `(9, 7)` or `(7, 6)` to continue growing.\n- Avoid getting trapped near the enemy's path, especially if they move toward `(9, 8)` or `(8, 7)`.\n- Keep an eye on the apple at `(4, 1)` as a fallback if other apples are blocked.\n- If the enemy starts moving aggressively, prioritize moves that keep distance or create space between you and them.\n\n---\nRIGHT",

However, it avoids the enemy's potential path to `(9, 5)` if they moved **DOWN** last turn.\n- **LEFT to `(8, 4)`**: Safe but does not immediately gain an apple. This move could help avoid future conflicts with the enemy moving toward `(8, 6)`.\n\n**Enemy Movement Considerations:**\n- If the enemy moved **LEFT** to `(8, 6)` last turn, they could now threaten `(7, 6)` or `(8, 5)`.\n- If the enemy moved **DOWN** to `(9, 5)`, they could block your path to `(9, 0)` if you move **DOWN** next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:**\n- Moving **UP** to `(9, 5)` is safer as it avoids the enemy's potential path to `(9, 5)` and keeps options open for reaching `(9, 0)`.\n- Moving **LEFT** to `(8, 4)` could be useful if the enemy moves toward `(8, 6)`, but it does not immediately help with the closest apple.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best move is **UP** to `(9, 5)` to avoid potential future conflicts and keep flexibility for reaching `(9, 0)`.\n\n---\n**Long-term plan for future moves:**\n- After moving to `(9, 5)`, prioritize moving toward `(9, 0)` to eat the next apple.\n- If the enemy moves toward `(8, 6)`, consider moving toward `(8, 5)` to avoid collision.\n- Keep an eye on the apple at `(7, 6)` as a fallback if other paths are blocked.\n- Avoid getting trapped near the enemy's path, especially if they move toward `(9, 5)`.\n\n---\nUP",

Their next move is likely to continue right or turn.\n3. **Your body blocks `(8, 5)` (up from head)**, so moving up is invalid.\n4. **Your last move was DOWN to `(8, 4)`**, which was safe and avoided the enemy.\n\n#### **Possible Moves from `(8, 4)`:**\n1. **UP**: `(8, 5)` \u2192 **Invalid** (occupied by your own body).\n2. **DOWN**: `(8, 3)` \u2192 **Valid** (no collision, safe).\n3. **LEFT**: `(7, 4)` \u2192 **Valid** (no collision, safe).\n4. **RIGHT**: `(9, 4)` \u2192 **Valid** (no collision, safe).\n\n**Safe moves: DOWN to `(8, 3)`, LEFT to `(7, 4)`, RIGHT to `(9, 4)`.**\n\n#### **Why RIGHT is the Best Move:**\n- **Avoids enemy collision**: The enemy's head is at `(3, 6)`, and their body extends to `(8, 6)`. Moving right to `(9, 4)` avoids their path.\n- **Moves toward `(9, 0)`**: `(9, 4)` is on the path toward `(9, 0)`, which is a high-priority apple.\n- **Opens new paths**: From `(9, 4)`, you can move toward `(9, 3)` (toward `(9, 0)`) or `(9, 5)` (but `(9, 5)` is occupied by your body).\n\n#### **Why DOWN is a Good Alternative:**\n- **Avoids enemy collision**: Moving down to `(8, 3)` is also safe.\n- **Moves toward `(8, 9)`**: `(8, 9)` is a high-value apple (distance = 5 units up).\n- **Opens new paths**: From `(8, 3)`, you can move toward `(8, 2)` (but `(8, 2)` is occupied by your body) or `(7, 3)` (toward `(6, 7)`).\n\n#### **Why LEFT is a Good Alternative:**\n- **Avoids enemy collision**: Moving left to `(7, 4)` is safe.\n- **Moves toward `(6, 7)`**: `(6, 7)` is a closer apple (distance = 2 units up-left).\n- **Opens new paths**: From `(7, 4)`, you can move toward `(7, 5)` (but `(7, 5)` is not occupied) or `(6, 4)` (toward `(6, 7)`).\n\n#### **Apple Prioritization:**\n1. `(9, 0)` (distance = 4 units down-right).\n2. `(8, 9)` (distance = 5 units up).\n3. `(6, 7)` (distance = 2 units up-left).\n\n**Closest apple is `(6, 7)`**, but `(9, 0)` is more valuable due to fewer obstacles and higher potential score.\n\n#### **Enemy Prediction:**\n- The enemy is moving rightward (`(3, 6) \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (8, 6)`). Their next move is likely to continue right or turn.\n- If they turn **UP** at `(8, 6)`, they could threaten `(8, 5)` or `(9, 6)`.\n- If they turn **DOWN** at `(8, 6)`, they could threaten `(8, 5)` or `(8, 7)`.\n- Moving right avoids their potential path and keeps you safe.\n\n#### **Long-Term Plan:**\n1. **Move RIGHT to `(9, 4)`** to avoid enemy collision and move toward `(9, 0)`.\n2. **Next moves**: Prioritize moving toward `(9, 0)` (e.g., `(9, 4) \u2192 (9, 3) \u2192 (9, 2) \u2192 (9, 1) \u2192 (9, 0)`).\n3. **Watch enemy**: If they turn toward `(9, 5)`, adjust to avoid collision.\n4. **Fallback**: If `(9, 0)` is blocked, move toward `(6, 7)` or `(8, 9)`.\n\n---\n**Final Decision: RIGHT** to `(9, 4)`. This keeps you safe, avoids the enemy, and opens paths to future apples.\n\n---\n**Long-term strategy note:**\n- Prioritize `(9, 0)` as it is a high-value apple with clear pathing.\n- Avoid getting trapped near enemy snakes; keep distance and flexibility.\n- If enemy starts moving toward your path, adjust to avoid collision.\n\n---\nRIGHT",
