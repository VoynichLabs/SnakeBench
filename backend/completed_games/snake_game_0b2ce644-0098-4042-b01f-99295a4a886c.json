The enemy snake's head is now at (7, 7) and I'm at (7, 4) - we're in the same column! The enemy snake has moved up and is now directly above me with its body occupying (7, 6). There's only one empty space at (7, 5) between me and the enemy snake's body.\n\nLet me analyze my movement options from (7, 4):\n- UP to (7, 5): This would put me directly adjacent to the enemy snake's body at (7, 6) - very dangerous!\n- DOWN to (7, 3): Safe, continues toward the apple at (7, 1)\n- LEFT to (6, 4): Safe, moves away from the enemy snake\n- RIGHT to (8, 4): Safe, moves away from the enemy snake\n\nThe enemy snake is positioned dangerously close in the same column.

However, the apple at (7, 9) is two steps away, which is reachable.\n   - **Advantages:**\n     - Progresses toward the apple at (7, 9), a high-value target.\n     - Opens pathways towards the upper regions of the board, allowing access to the apple at (0, 8) later.\n   - **Disadvantages:**\n     - Moving further up limits immediate options to other regions.\n     - Requires navigating around the upper boundary in subsequent moves.\n\n2. **DOWN:** Moving to **(7, 6)**\n   - **Safety:** **Unsafe.** This position is occupied by our own body segment at (7, 6).\n   - **Advantages:** None.\n   - **Disadvantages:**\n     - Results in a collision with our own body, leading to death.\n\n3. **RIGHT:** Moving to **(8, 7)**\n   - **Safety:** **Safe.** The position is unoccupied.\n   - **Advantages:**\n     - Positions the snake closer to the apple at (9, 7), which is adjacent and can be consumed in the next move.\n     - Maintains a central-to-right positioning, allowing flexibility for future moves.\n   - **Disadvantages:**\n     - Moves away from the apple at (7, 9), which is also a high-value target.\n     - Potentially edges closer to the right boundary, which could limit future movement options.\n\n4. **LEFT:** Moving to **(6, 7)**\n   - **Safety:** **Safe.** The position is unoccupied.\n   - **Advantages:**\n     - Maintains proximity to the central area of the board, allowing access to multiple regions.\n     - Keeps options open for navigating towards either lower or upper apples.\n   - **Disadvantages:**\n     - Does not immediately target any nearby apples.\n     - Requires additional moves to approach the nearest apple, potentially delaying point accumulation.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nAfter evaluating the options, moving **RIGHT** to **(8, 7)** appears to be the most advantageous choice at this juncture. Here's why:\n\n- **Immediate Apple Access:** By moving right, the snake is positioned just one step away from the apple at (9, 7). In the next move, consuming this apple will provide an immediate point boost and extend the snake's length, enhancing future maneuverability.\n  \n- **Strategic Positioning:** Maintaining a central-to-right position keeps multiple pathways open, allowing flexibility to switch directions based on the evolving board state. This adaptability is crucial for navigating around the enemy snake and other potential obstacles.\n\n- **Safety Considerations:** The rightward path is currently clear of both our own body and the enemy snake, reducing the immediate risk of collision.\n\nWhile moving **UP** towards (7, 8) also presents a viable option by edging closer to another high-value apple, the immediate opportunity to consume the apple at (9, 7) by moving **RIGHT** offers a more tangible short-term benefit without compromising long-term strategy.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving **RIGHT** to (8, 7), the focus will shift to:\n\n1. **Consuming the Apple at (9, 7):** Ensure that the subsequent move targets the apple to maximize point gain and snake length.\n\n2. **Monitoring Enemy Snake Movements:** Keep a close watch on the enemy snake's position to avoid potential collisions, especially as both snakes navigate towards high-value apples.\n\n3. **Maintaining Open Pathways:** As the snake grows, it's essential to avoid tight corridors that could lead to self-trapping. Prioritize moves that keep multiple escape routes open.\n\n4. **Balancing Aggression and Caution:** While pursuing apples aggressively increases points, it's vital to balance this with cautious navigation to ensure sustained survival and adaptability to dynamic board states.\n\n**Decided next move:** **RIGHT**"

This completes my two-turn strategy to get this apple\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I'll need to plan my next target. The remaining apples will be at: (7, 9), (0, 8), (4, 2), and (4, 6). The apple at (4, 2) looks like a good next target since it's relatively close and the enemy snake seems focused on the upper area.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After growing by collecting the apple at (7, 1), I should start moving toward the apple at (4, 2). I'll need to move LEFT and UP to get there, and I'll have to be careful not to run into my own body since I'll be longer.\n\nDOWN"

Now let me think strategically about which direction serves me best:\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n- (0, 8): Too dangerous, very close to enemy snake\n- (2, 2): This is directly below me! If I go DOWN to (2, 4), then DOWN to (2, 3), then DOWN to (2, 2), I can collect this apple in 3 moves\n- (0, 0): Also accessible but further away\n- (7, 2): Too close to enemy snake territory\n- (1, 2): Also accessible from the lower area\n\nThe apple at (2, 2) is in a perfect position - it's directly south of me and in a safe area away from the enemy snake. The enemy snake #1 is still occupying the upper portion of the board with its long body, so continuing to work in the lower area is the smart play.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving DOWN toward the apple at (2, 2). After collecting that apple, I can then target either (0, 0) or (1, 2) since they're both in the safe lower area. Keep avoiding the upper half where the enemy snake dominates.\n\nDOWN"

The lower portion of the board remains relatively safe for me to operate in.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (1, 2), I'll be positioned well to potentially go for the apple at (0, 0) in the bottom-left corner, or I could move toward other apples depending on how the situation develops.\n\nThe remaining apples after this move will be at: (0, 0), (7, 2), (5, 5), and (1, 3).

The bottom row remains clear and I have a direct path. The enemy snake at (5, 5) is still far away and focused on the upper portion of the board.\n\nContinuing RIGHT keeps me on the optimal path to the nearest apple.

After collecting this apple, I'll have excellent positioning to grab either the apple at (8, 1) or potentially work toward (7, 2).

Moving **DOWN** not only brings the snake closer to two apples but also keeps it centralized, allowing for greater maneuverability and reducing the risk of becoming trapped. Additionally, maintaining flexibility to navigate towards various apple locations ensures adaptability to changing board dynamics.\n\n**Decided next move:** **DOWN**"
