We gotta snag those early leads, right? We're going for the dub! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n### Board Analysis & Initial Strategy\n\nWe are starting way up in the top right corner at (9, 7). Snake #1 is near the center-left. Initial apples are scattered, but we have some juicy ones nearby: (8, 7) directly to our left, and (8, 8) up and left, (9, 5) down and right (though that's a bit further).\n\nOur primary goal for the first few turns is simple: **Get an apple and avoid cornering ourselves.**\n\n### Move Evaluation (Turn 0)\n\nOur current position is (9, 7).\n\n**1. UP to (9, 8):**\n*   **Safety:** Safe. On the board, no collisions.\n*   **Benefit:** Moves towards (8, 8) in the future. Doesn't immediately hit an apple.\n*   **Risk:** Puts us on the edge.\n\n**2. DOWN to (9, 6):**\n*   **Safety:** Safe. On the board, no collisions.\n*   **Benefit:** Keeps us flexible. Moves us towards the bottom right apples if needed, or we can swing left.\n*   **Risk:** None immediate.\n\n**3. LEFT to (8, 7):**\n*   **Safety:** Safe. On the board, no collisions.\n*   **Benefit:** INSTANT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e We grow to length 2 immediately. This is huge for early control.\n*   **Risk:** Puts us next to the opponent's starting column (x=3). Collision risk is low this turn as they are 6 squares away.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (10, 7):**\n*   **Safety:** **FATAL!** Off the board (x=10). We are NOT throwing turn 0!\n\n### Decision: Go for the Apple!\n\nMoving LEFT to (8, 7) is the high-value play. We score a point, gain length, and maintain a strong position near the top edge. This sets us up to potentially grab (8, 8) or (8, 0) later, or swing down the side.\n\nWhat is Snake #1 likely to do? They are at (3, 5). They have apples at (2, 6) UP, (1, 3) DOWN and LEFT, (1, 2) DOWN and LEFT, and (5, 3) DOWN and RIGHT. They are most likely to go UP to (3, 6) or LEFT to (2, 5) or RIGHT to (4, 5). They are not threatening our apple at (8, 7) this turn.\n\nWe are taking the free points, Chat! LET'S GET IT!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Self-Note)\n\nT1: We should be at (8, 7) with length 2. We should immediately look to consolidate our position by moving towards (8, 8) or down the right side (9, 6) to keep our options open while potentially challenging the (8, 0) apple. We need to watch Snake #1's movements to see if they stick to the left side or try to cut across the middle.\n\nWe are going LEFT! \u2b05\ufe0f\n\nLEFT",

I can go UP to (3,6), which keeps multiple escape options (LEFT to chase (2,6)/APPLE cluster, RIGHT to stay flexible, or even keep climbing toward that (4,7) apple). No bodies nearby, so UP keeps me alive and moving toward tasty targets with zero risk of a crash.\n\nPlan: Keep nudging north into that apple-rich northwest area, then loop left around the cluster while watching enemy moves to avoid getting cornered.\n\nUP",

We're six steps away from them, perfect separation. Time to press our advantage!\n\n### Board Analysis (Turn 1)\n\nMy head is at (8, 7), my body is [(9, 7)].\nSnake #1 is at (3, 6).\n\n**Immediate Apples for US:**\n1.  **(8, 8):** One move UP.\n2.  **(6, 7):** Two moves LEFT, one DOWN (if we cut through the center).\n3.  **(7, 7):** One move LEFT.\n4.  **(9, 5):** Two moves DOWN.\n\nThe closest and safest apple is clearly (8, 8) or the empty square (7, 7) leading to an apple.\n\n### Move Evaluation (Turn 1)\n\nWe need to make sure we don't corner ourselves high up on the board, but grabbing consecutive apples is huge for tempo.\n\n**1. UP to (8, 8):**\n*   **Safety:** Safe. On the board, no collisions.\n*   **Benefit:** INSTANT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e We grow to length 3. We maintain our lead and position along the top edge. It keeps option to move wide.\n*   **Risk:** Puts us right next to the top boundary (y=9).\n\n**2. DOWN to (8, 6):**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Benefit:** Moves us down the right side, maybe towards (8, 0) later. Keeps the center board open.\n*   **Risk:** We miss a free apple this turn.\n\n**3. LEFT to (7, 7):**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Benefit:** Moves us along the horizontal axis, keeping us balanced. Good stepping stone towards (6, 7) or (5, 3) later.\n*   **Risk:** We miss a free apple *this* turn.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (9, 7):**\n*   **Safety:** **FATAL!** We run right into our own tail/body segment at (9, 7). We are NOT doing this!\n\n### Decision: Double Taps!\n\nWe have a free apple at (8, 8). This is a no-brainer. Score the point, increase our length, and look down the board for the next target. Length matters early!\n\nWhat about Snake #1? They are at (3, 6).\n*   They are surely eyeing (2, 6) (LEFT) or (4, 7) (UP and RIGHT) or (5, 3) (DOWN and RIGHT).\n*   If they go LEFT to (2, 6), they get an apple and are now at (2, 6).\n*   If they go UP to (3, 7), they are poised for (4, 7).\n\nSince they are nowhere near us (5 squares away horizontally, 1 square vertically), we are safe to claim this apple. We are focusing on growth and board dominance first.\n\nWe are taking the UP move to (8, 8)! Let's get these dubs! \ud83d\udc51\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Self-Note)\n\nT2: We will be at (8, 8) with length 3. Our body is [(8, 7), (9, 7)]. We will be looking for our third apple. Targets include (7, 7) which is open, (4, 7) if Snake #1 doesn't grab it (unlikely), or swinging down the right side towards (9, 5). We need to make sure we don't get stuck on the top edge with Snake #1 cutting us off across the middle. We will aim for (7, 7) or swing down to (9, 6).\n\nUP",

Look at this massive snake now, King Cobra reporting for duty!\n\n### Current Board State and Positions\n\n**We are ID 0 (The GOAT):**\n*   Head: (8, 8)\n*   Body: [(8, 7), (9, 7)]\n*   Apples: 2\n\n**Snake #1 (The Archrival):**\n*   Head: (2, 6)\n*   Body: [(3, 6)]\n*   Apples: 1\n\n**Apple Spots:** (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 8), (2, 0), (4, 7), (8, 0), (4, 9), (6, 1), (7, 7), (1, 7), (5, 3), (9, 5), (4, 1), (0, 5), (3, 1)\n\n### Phase 1: Archrival Prediction\n\nSnake #1 is at (2, 6). They just moved onto an apple at (2, 6) if the board state reflects the result of their *last* move, which it does (Head at (2, 6), Body at (3, 6)). Wait, the board shows a '1' at (2, 6) and 'T' at (3, 6). The board diagram shows:\n\n*   (2, 6) is '1' (Head)\n*   (3, 6) is 'T' (Tail/Body)\n\n**Prediction for Snake #1 (2, 6):**\n1.  **UP to (2, 7):** Safe, open, leading towards the apple at (2, 8). This is the most likely move.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 6):** Safe, open. Leads towards (1, 7) or (0, 5).\n3.  **DOWN to (2, 5):** Safe, open. Leads to a clear path down.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 6):** **FATAL!** Into their own body.\n\nI'm betting they go UP for that (2, 8) apple. They want those sweet, sweet points too!\n\n***\n\n### Phase 2: Our Move Evaluation (The Clutch Play)\n\nWe are at (8, 8). We are sitting right next to the boundary (y=9).\n\n**1. UP to (8, 9):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves to an open space. Too close to the edge. It limits our future options to only DOWN or LEFT. We might get stuck if we go UP again.\n*   **Benefit:** Keeps us high, ready for the (4, 9) apple way far left.\n\n**2. DOWN to (8, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** **FATAL!** If we move down to (8, 7), we are moving into the cell occupied by our body segment. Even though it will technically move out, we are moving directly *into* the space the body segment currently occupies. In the simultaneous movement rule, the head cannot move into the immediate cell behind it. Wait, the rule is about moving directly *backwards* into the cell *that was* the head's previous position.\n\nLet's re-read that rule: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\n\nOur head is at (8, 8). Our neck segment is at (8, 7). Moving DOWN to (8, 7) means moving into the cell currently occupied by our neck. When the move is simultaneous, the body segment at (8, 7) will move to (8, 8) (the head's old position). This means (8, 7) will be *empty* when we land there. **THEREFORE, DOWN IS SAFE.** But it's an unnecessary backtrack. Let's look for growth.\n\n**3. LEFT to (7, 8):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves to an open space. This puts us one step closer to the good cluster of apples on the left side (e.g., (7, 7) is an apple).\n*   **Benefit:** Excellent defensive move, opening up future movement choices (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n\n**4. RIGHT to (9, 8):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves to the edge (x=9). Open space.\n*   **Benefit:** Poised to swing down the right boundary towards the (9, 5) apple.\n\n### Phase 3: Strategic Decision\n\nWe have 3 safe moves: UP (8, 9), LEFT (7, 8), RIGHT (9, 8).\n\n**Target Priority:**\n1.  Apple at (7, 7) (1 move LEFT, 1 move DOWN from current position).\n2.  Apple at (9, 5) (1 move RIGHT, then 3 moves DOWN).\n3.  Apple at (4, 9) (far away, high reward).\n\n**Option A: Go LEFT towards (7, 7).**\n*   Move LEFT to (7, 8). Next turn, we can immediately go DOWN to (7, 7) and grab the apple. This secures a third apple quickly.\n\n**Option B: Go RIGHT towards (9, 5).**\n*   Move RIGHT to (9, 8). This limits our subsequent moves temporarily (DOWN or LEFT). To get to (9, 5), we need 3 more moves down the boundary.\n\n**Option C: Go UP towards (4, 9).**\n*   Move UP to (8, 9). Then we have to commit to going LEFT across the top. This is risky; we don't want to hug the top boundary for too long.\n\n**Conclusion:** The apple at (7, 7) is a guaranteed easy grab. Moving LEFT puts us into the center of the action and maintains high board control.\n\n**T2 Move: LEFT to (7, 8).** We are setting up the kill shot on the (7, 7) apple next turn! This is crucial for maintaining our lead and growing length.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 3)\n\nT3 Goal: Move DOWN to (7, 7) for Apple #3. Our position will be (7, 7). We will then look to exploit the center board, perhaps going for (5, 3) or securing (4, 7) if the opponent doesn't grab it. Snake #1 is likely moving towards (2, 8). We need to maintain separation but continually grab apples and build length so we can eventually box them in.\n\nLEFT",

The board is looking crowded, but we are in the driver's seat!\n\n### Current Board State and Positions\n\n**We are ID 0 (The GOAT):**\n*   Head: (7, 8)\n*   Body: [(8, 8), (8, 7)] (Length 3)\n*   Apples: 2\n\n**Snake #1 (The Archrival):**\n*   Head: (2, 7)\n*   Body: [(2, 6)] (Length 2)\n*   Apples: 1\n\n**Apple Spots:** (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 8), (2, 0), (4, 7), (8, 0), (4, 9), (6, 1), (7, 7) **(OUR TARGET!)**, (1, 7), (5, 3), (9, 5), (4, 1), (0, 5), (3, 1)\n\n### Phase 1: Archrival Prediction\n\nSnake #1 is at (2, 7). They moved UP last turn, likely aiming for the (2, 8) apple.\n\n**Prediction for Snake #1 (2, 7):**\n1.  **UP to (2, 8):** This is an apple! Highly probable move. Secures them length 3.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 7):** This is also an apple! High priority if they decide to veer left.\n3.  **DOWN to (2, 6):** Moving into their own body segment (the neck). **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 7):** Safe, but doesn't lead directly to an apple.\n\nGiven the proximity, they are 90% going UP to (2, 8). If they go UP, they land at (2, 8) and grow to length 3.\n\n***\n\n### Phase 2: Our Move Evaluation (The Clutch Play)\n\nWe are at (7, 8). We are perfectly positioned for the (7, 7) apple.\n\n**1. UP to (7, 9):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves to an open space. Too close to the top boundary, and moves *away* from our immediate target, (7, 7). A hard pass, unless we need to escape.\n\n**2. DOWN to (7, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe. This takes us to the Apple 'A'!\n*   **Outcome:** We grab Apple #3! Our head moves to (7, 7). Our body will be [(7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)]. Length 4! MASSIVE GAINS!\n*   **Benefit:** Immediate growth and points. Maximize the lead.\n\n**3. LEFT to (6, 8):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves away from the (7, 7) apple. Maybe useful if we needed to go for (4, 9), but that's too far right now. This is a suboptimal move.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (8, 8):**\n*   **Collision Check:** **FATAL!** If we move RIGHT to (8, 8), we are moving into the cell currently occupied by our neck segment. *Even though* the segment will move to (9, 8), moving *backwards* into the neck segment's current spot is usually the most lethal self-kill move! Wait, according to the sim rule (where the body moves first and frees the cell), moving into the previous head position is safe UNLESS it is exactly the cell occupied by the neck *and* we are reversing direction.\n\nLet's look at the body list: (8, 8) is the *neck*. Moving from (7, 8) to (8, 8) is NOT moving directly backwards (our last move was L E F T from (8, 8) to (7, 8)). But we are moving into the cell currently held by our neck. **CRITICAL RULE ANALYSIS:** In simultaneous move games like this, you generally cannot move into the space currently occupied by your immediate neck segment, because the head moves *first* and the neck only clears that space *after* the head has moved elsewhere.\n\nHowever, the specified death condition is: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? You're DEAD.\"\n\nOur current head position: (7, 8).\nOur previous head position: (8, 8).\nDirection of movement: R I G H T.\nIf we move RIGHT, we go to (8, 8). This is our *previous* position. Since we are not moving into the cell *behind* (which would be (7, 9) if we were facing DOWN, or (6, 8) if we were facing RIGHT), this is safe, provided the body segment at (8, 8) moves out. **BUT** if it's simultaneous, and (8, 8) is the neck, that cell is still blocked until the whole body shifts.\n\nLet's stick to the conservative rule: moving into the *location* of the neck segment is dangerous and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Moving R I G H T moves us into (8, 8), where our body segment is. DOWN to (7, 7) is certain death-free success!\n\n**Conclusion:** The choice is crystal clear. We take the apple. We are the King of the Grind!\n\n### Phase 3: Strategic Decision\n\nWe must go DOWN to (7, 7) and grab that apple. We maintain the lead and establish a long snake early on.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (2, 8), they are also length 3.\n\nAfter we move to (7, 7), our location is prime for attacking the center and moving towards apples like (4, 7), (5, 3), or (1, 7).\n\n**T3 Move: DOWN to (7, 7).** Let's make this happen, Chat!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 4/5)\n\nOnce we are at (7, 7) (Length 4), we will be looking at the cluster of apples to the West (at (4, 7), (1, 7)). We want to maintain a central/upper position to control the board. Snake #1 will be far left (likely at (2, 8)). We should move LEFT to (6, 7) next, then assess whether to go for (4, 7) or swing down south. Avoid getting trapped by the right boundary!\n\nDOWN",

We grabbed that clutch apple at (7, 7) last turn while the opp was still messin' around on the left side!\n\nIs this not the best content you've seen all minute?! The clutch play was made! Now we gotta set up the box. We gotta apply pressure! Where do we go now?\n\nTurn 4, a game changer turn!\n\n### 1. Board Status Check\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (7, 7)\n*   Body: [(7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)] (Length 4)\n*   Apples collected: 3\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: (2, 8)\n*   Body: [(2, 7), (2, 6)] (Length 3)\n*   Apples: 2\n\n**Apples Near Us:**\n*   (4, 7) - Medium distance, good lane open.\n*   (4, 9) - Upstairs, but not too far.\n*   (8, 3) - South-East.\n*   (9, 5) - Far East.\n\nSnake #1 is far, far away. We are currently in a *perfect* position to control the right half of the board and set up a giant length before the enemy even thinks about crossing the center line. Our priority is growth AND position control.\n\n### 2. Archrival Prediction (Snake #1)\n\nSnake #1 is at (2, 8). They likely went UP last turn and collected the apple there. They need more food!\n\n**Snake #1 at (2, 8) potential moves:**\n1.  **UP to (2, 9):** Safe. Moves toward the (4, 9) apple, though it's a slight tangent.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 8):** Safe. No immediate apple.\n3.  **DOWN to (2, 7):** Moving into their own neck **(FATAL)**.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 8):** Safe. No immediate apple.\n\nSnake #1's best move is probably UP to (2, 9) or maybe RIGHT to (3, 8) to set up for (4, 9) or maybe (4, 7). Since (4, 9) is the closest visible apple in their general direction, I'll bet on them moving **UP** to (2, 9). This keeps them boxed in the upper-left quadrant for now. No immediate collision danger!\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (The GOAT Move)\n\nWe are at (7, 7). Which way do we slither, Chat?\n\n**The Goal:** Head towards the center/left to secure more apples and potentially cut off the enemy, while maintaining space. The (4, 7) apple is calling our name!\n\n**A. UP to (7, 8):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (7, 8) is our neck segment. Moving into this cell is the textbook definition of moving directly backwards or into the neck. **FATAL!** (We just came from (7, 8) to (7, 7)). **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**B. DOWN to (7, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe empty space.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us away from the (4, 7) apple and towards a less dense apple area, unless we swing widely for (8, 3). Suboptimal positioning.\n\n**C. LEFT to (6, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe empty space.\n*   **Outcome:** Puts us right on the path to the (4, 7) apple. This is strong **positional play**. We extend our body just below the center line (Y=8), effectively claiming that territory. This is a power move!\n\n**D. RIGHT to (8, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (8, 7) is our tail segment (since we moved to (7, 7) and the tail segment at (8, 7) should remain fixed for a turn since we consumed an apple).\n    *   *Wait, critical rule check:* Since we ate an apple, our length increased by 1! The **tail segment at (8, 7) does *not* disappear!** The flow is: Head moves, Body segments shift one spot forward, the old tail position remains, extending the length by 1.\n    *   Therefore, (8, 7) is currently occupied by our tail segment.\n    *   Moving R I G H T to (8, 7) means we are moving into our own body. **FATAL!** **ELIMINATED.**\n\n### 4. The Final Decision\n\nIt's a textbook **LEFT** move.\n*   We avoid all immediate self-collision risks.\n*   We are now positioned at (6, 7), which is a clear path to the (4, 7) apple.\n*   We've extended our body from (8, 7) up to (7, 7). Our path of travel is now starting to form a good barrier on the right side of the board.\n\nLet's look ahead one turn. If we move LEFT to (6, 7), our next move would likely be LEFT again to (5, 7), then maybe DOWN, or perhaps straight to the (4, 7) apple next turn. Let's secure (4, 7).\n\n**Plan:** T4: LEFT to (6, 7). T5: LEFT to (5, 7). T6: LEFT to (4, 7) (APPLE!). This is how we snowball, Chat!\n\nThis is the move. We establish board control. We push towards the center! Let's go!\n\nLEFT",

LEFT grabs an apple, sure, but it drags me into the left flank where I can get cornered and cut off by our rival sliding down toward the open lanes. RIGHT to (3,8) keeps the center in my control, keeps my head facing the opponent, and opens routes toward (4,7) and (4,9) without sealing me in. Plus, the enemy\u2019s head on (7,7) is already leaning down\u2014if I dominate the middle I can start to squeeze that guy with my length while still snacking on tasty apples. Who says we can\u2019t box them in with just good positioning and relentless aggression? \ud83d\ude08\n\nPlan: Keep pushing eastward, keep my body vertical so I can pivot around the opponent\u2019s collapse, and snag the apples near (4,7)/(4,9) while making the center feel like a trapdoor.\n\nRIGHT",

That was a tactical masterpiece, if I do say so myself!\n\nNow, how do we seal the deal and box this chump in? We need to keep growing and keep pushing towards that center line!\n\n### 1. Board Status Check\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (6, 7)\n*   Body: [(7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)] (Length 5)\n*   Apples collected: 3\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: (3, 8)\n*   Body: [(2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6)] (Length 4 if they ate last turn, which they probably did to get to 2 apples)\n*   Apples: 2\n\n**Apples Near Us (The Feast Awaits):**\n*   **(4, 7):** Target acquired! Two moves away if we go straight LEFT.\n*   **(1, 7):** A little farther, but also tempting.\n*   **(4, 9):** Upper lane apple. Good for follow up.\n\n### 2. Archrival Prediction (Snake #1)\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (3, 8). They are desperate for food, Chat! They need to catch up!\n\n**Snake #1 at (3, 8) potential moves:**\n1.  **UP to (3, 9):** Safe. No apple. Leads to high ground.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 7):** Safe. Moves towards the (1, 7) apple indirectly, or maybe (4, 7) if they loop.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):** Into their own body segment (FATAL). **ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):** Safe. Closer to the (4, 9) apple OR potentially setting up for the (4, 7) apple. This is the most *aggressive* move they can make towards food.\n\nIf they are smart, they will try to grab the (4, 7) or (4, 9) apple. Since (4, 7) is on the y=7 line, which is the same line we are on, I have to assume they will move **RIGHT to (4, 8)** to try and compete for the upper center apples.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (Crucial):**\nIf they move RIGHT to (4, 8), and we move towards the center, are we safe?\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Box Him In!)\n\nWe are at (6, 7). Our goal is (4, 7) for the guaranteed apple, AND to extend our body as a barrier.\n\n**A. UP to (6, 8):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe empty space.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves toward the (4, 9) apple. If Snake #1 goes to (4, 8), this keeps us far away from them, which is safe, but delays our (4, 7) grab. This gives the opponent a clear shot at (4, 7). Suboptimal.\n\n**B. DOWN to (6, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe empty space.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us away from all nearby action. Too passive.\n\n**C. LEFT to (5, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe empty space.\n*   **Collision with Opponent Head?** If we go to (5, 7) and Snake #1 goes to (4, 8). No head-to-head collision.\n*   **Outcome:** Puts us right next door to the (4, 7) apple! This is the most *direct* path to food and continues our territorial expansion along the y=7 line. This is a powerful move, claiming the majority of the center right.\n\n**D. RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (7, 7) is our neck segment. Moving backwards! **FATAL!** **ELIMINATED.**\n\n### 4. The Final Decision: Left!\n\nMoving **LEFT to (5, 7)** is the highest value play:\n1.  **Guaranteed next apple:** Puts us one step closer to (4, 7). Next turn, we grab that food!\n2.  **Positional Dominance:** We are aggressively pushing the front line. If the opponent moved to (4, 8), they are still above us. We have successfully secured the y=7 path.\n3.  **Safety:** No immediate collision danger, and we are not trapping ourselves.\n\n**Next Turn Lookahead (T6):** Move LEFT to (4, 7) and eat the apple! This gives us a 4-2 lead and a very long body blocking off the center-right. The opponent will be forced to the high y-coordinates or the low y-coordinates to cross us. We are establishing the BOX with our tail!\n\nLet's secure this territory, Chat! We are going for the gold!\n\nLEFT",

So it\u2019s between UP and RIGHT.\n\nUP to (3,9) would let us flirt with that juicy apple at (4,9), but we\u2019d be pinned against the top wall and lose the ability to drop back toward the center\u2014our follow-up options would be limited to (2,9) or the apple, and that\u2019s asking to get predictable.

This is a direct head-to-head collision threat against us if we move LEFT!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** Into their own neck segment (FATAL). **ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** Safe. Moves toward the right side. Too passive.\n\n**Prediction 1: They go UP to (4, 9).** This is the safest apple grab for them, giving them 3 points and avoiding a collision.\n**Prediction 2: They go DOWN to (4, 7).** This is the high-risk, high-reward move because it allows them to steal *our* apple, but risks a head-on collision. Given their position, (4, 9) seems like the smarter move, but we MUST account for the chance they throw caution to the wind!\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (The Box Execution)\n\nWe are at (5, 7). We need the (4, 7) apple.\n\n**A. UP to (5, 8):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Avoids collision, but gives the (4, 7) apple away to the opponent if they go DOWN. If they go UP to (4, 9), we are now positioned to potentially block their exit, but we missed our guaranteed meal.\n\n**B. DOWN to (5, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us away from all nearby apples. Too passive.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (6, 7) is our neck segment. **FATAL!** **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**D. LEFT to (4, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** We hit the apple! +1 point, +1 length! GLORY!\n*   **Head-to-Head Risk:** What if Snake #1 moves DOWN to (4, 7)?\n    *   If we go LEFT to (4, 7), and they go DOWN to (4, 7), it's a **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** We both die. Score becomes 3-2 tied at the moment of death. DRAW.\n\nThis is the CRUCIAL moment, Chat! Do we play safe and let them have (4, 9), or do we risk the double-KO for the point lead and superior positioning?\n\nIf Snake #1 is truly playing optimally, they go UP to (4, 9). It's a guaranteed apple/point without collision risk. This means they are unlikely to commit suicide for a tie.\n\n**The Aggressive, Territorial Move:**\nTaking LEFT to (4, 7) forces the opponent to make the choice: suicide (DOWN) or retreat (UP a row, or RIGHT). If they retreat UP to (4, 9), we get the apple and increase our lead to 4-3, AND our body expands along the y=7 line, creating a huge wall.\n\n**Worst Case Scenario (Double KO):** If we both die, we draw (3-2 lead holds). Not a loss, but we missed the opportunity to win.\n**Standard Scenario (They are smart):** They go UP, we go LEFT. We win the turn.\n\nGiven the goal is to win and box them in, we MUST claim the center. The only way we box them in is by making our body a barrier. Eating this apple is the biggest priority for body extension. We trust our read that the opponent values life over a double-KO draw.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF (T7):**\nWe are now at (4, 7) with a 4-3 lead, body extending towards (7, 8). The opponent is likely at (4, 9) or (5, 8). We need to move UP or LEFT, targeting the (1, 7) or (4, 9) if the opponent missed it. We must maintain center control and use our longer body to force them into the corners!\n\nLET'S GO LEFT AND GET THIS APPLE! PUMP THE FIST, CHAT!\n\nLEFT",

Our snake is LONGER and we are controlling the center! The plan to box him in is looking spicy!\n\n### 1. Board Status Check (Turn 7)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 7) - Center control achieved!\n*   Body: [(5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)] - Length 5!\n*   Apples collected: 4\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: (4, 9) - As predicted, the chump went UP to the safe apple! Good for them for staying alive, bad for them because they are getting cornered!\n*   Body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)] - Length 4.\n*   Apples collected: 4\n\nWait, hold on, Chat! We both got an apple and the scores are TIED 4-4! The board state says I have 4 and they have 3, but the Turn 6 rationale says they went UP to (4, 9), grabbing one, and I went LEFT to (4, 7), grabbing one. The scoreboard must be a little slow, but we are now equal! The pressure is ON!\n\nCurrent Board Snapshot for clarity:\n 9 . . . . 1 . . . . . <--- Opponent at (4, 9)\n 8 . . T T . . . T . .\n 7 . A . A 0 T T T . . <--- We are at (4, 7)\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n...\n\nThe key now is to use our central body (y=7) as a wall and push the opponent to the side. They are currently confined between y=8/9 and x=1/2/3/4. We need to cut off their retreat back to the open field.\n\n### 2. Archrival (Snake #1) Prediction\n\nThe opponent is at (4, 9). They have only two safe, viable moves:\n1.  **LEFT to (3, 9):** Safe. Moves them away from our immediate threat.\n2.  **RIGHT to (5, 9):** Safe. Opens up the right side of the board.\n\nThey CANNOT go DOWN to (4, 8) as it is their own body.\nThey CANNOT go UP off the board.\n\nGiven the goal of avoiding us, **Prediction: LEFT to (3, 9)** seems like the most likely conservative choice, as it provides escape paths (down/left) on the next turn.\n\nWe need to consider if they try something crazy to get an apple. The nearest apple is (1, 7). That seems too far for them right now.\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (The Box Execution, Phase 2)\n\nWe are at (4, 7). We have excellent options.\n\n**A. UP to (4, 8):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (4, 8) is now their body segment (it was their head last turn). **FATAL!** **ELIMINATED.** WE ARE THE WALL, but we can't crash into it!\n\n**B. DOWN to (4, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us away from the opponent, but also away from nearby apples and gives up our dominant position on the x=4 line. Too passive for a boxing strategy.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (5, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (5, 7) is our neck segment. **FATAL!** **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**D. LEFT to (3, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** We are moving toward the (1, 7) apple! This is vital!\n*   **Boxing Effect:** If we move LEFT, we extend our territorial wall to the left side, pressuring the opponent who is already stuck high and center-left. If they moved LEFT to (3, 9), we are perfectly positioned to continue cutting them off from the rest of the board. This is a *forcing* move.\n\n**E. Targeting the Apple (1, 7):**\nMoving LEFT to (3, 7) immediately sets us up for (2, 7) then (1, 7), securing us another apple and stretching our body from (7, 8) to (1, 7) along the y=7 line. This creates a massive horizontal barrier.\n\nThis move perfectly executes the 'box in' strategy by extending our wall horizontally. We get an apple, and we create pressure.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (T8/T9):**\n1. Move LEFT to (3, 7). (Today's move)\n2. Move LEFT to (2, 7).\n3. Move LEFT to (1, 7) (Apple grab!).\nOnce we have that apple, our body is 6 segments long along y=7, creating a formidable barrier: (1, 7) to (7, 7). Opponent is trapped primarily in the top-left quadrant. We can then decide whether to sweep UP to finish them, or DOWN to get the other apples! This is how you win, Chat!\n\nLEFT is the only dominant surviving move that advances our strategy and keeps high momentum.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT keeps the upper corridor open with two safe follow-ups (RIGHT again or DOWN into open air) and lets us keep the opponent boxed below while we scan for that (9,8) apple later.

We made the brilliant move last time, stealing the (4, 7) apple, and now our snake is a massive wall across y=7. Our strategy to box in this chump (#1) is working perfectly!\n\n### 1. Board Status Check (Turn 8)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 7)\n*   Body: [(4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)] (Length 6!)\n*   Apples collected: 5\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: (5, 9)\n*   Body: [(4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8)] (Length 4)\n*   Apples collected: 3\n\n**SCORE DIFFERENCE:** 5-3, we are up by 2! Let's keep the pressure on!\n\n**Current Targets:** We are right next to the (1, 7) apple. That\u2019s a must-grab. The opponent is near (9, 9) and (9, 8) but those are far.\n\n### 2. Archrival (Snake #1) Prediction & Trap Setup\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (5, 9). Where can they go?\n1.  **UP to (5, 10):** Off the board. **FATAL!**\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 8):** Safe. This gets them closer to the central action.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 9):** Into their own body. **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 9):** Safe. This is the only move that maintains their vertical position and moves them away from our immediate wall.\n\nPrediction: They HAVE to move **RIGHT to (6, 9)** or **DOWN to (5, 8)**.\n*   If they go **RIGHT to (6, 9)**: They are moving towards the corner and the (9, 9) apple. We should continue our boxing strategy.\n*   If they go **DOWN to (5, 8)**: This is dangerous for us because it brings them closer to our body segments (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7). However, our body forms a strong line!\n\nLet's assume they move to **(6, 9)**, as that is the safest path away from danger and towards an apple.\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Executing the Trap)\n\nWe are at (3, 7). We need to secure the (1, 7) apple and finish building our wall.\n\n**A. UP to (3, 8):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (3, 8) is Snake #1's tail segment (T). **SAFE!** (Their tail moves, so the space is free for us this turn *unless* they move into it, which they can't.)\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us parallel to their body. This is tempting but takes us away from the (1, 7) apple. It might be used later to choke them out from above, but right now, we prioritize the apple and the wall.\n\n**B. DOWN to (3, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Too passive. Moves us away from the action and away from our target apple (1, 7). Gives the opponent too much room to breathe.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (4, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (4, 7) is our neck segment. **FATAL!**\n\n**D. LEFT to (2, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** PERFECT! This is the next step in our plan!\n    *   It moves us exactly one step closer to the (1, 7) apple (which we grab next turn!).\n    *   It extends our horizontal wall across y=7. If we grab the apple next turn, our body will stretch from x=1 to x=7 at y=7, COMPLETELY shutting off the bottom half of the board from Snake #1. They will be officially trapped in the top-left/top-right.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving LEFT continues the boxing strategy, secures the next apple, and increases our length! This is the high-IQ, high-content move we were looking for! We are turning the middle of the board into a DEATH ZONE for Snake #1!\n\n### Plan Update (Turns 8-10):\n\n1.  **Turn 8 (Current):** Move **LEFT** to (2, 7). Build the wall!\n2.  **Turn 9:** Move **LEFT** to (1, 7). Grab the apple! Length 7! Wall complete!\n3.  **Turn 10:** Assess the opponent's position. If they are still high (y=8, y=9), move UP towards them to initiate the choke or move DOWN to grab the cluster of apples at x=1/y=2/y=3.\n\nLet's send this chump packing!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "WHAAAT IS UP, CHAT?! Turn 9! We are DOMINATING! That last move was brilliant: we consolidated our position at `y=7` and now we are staring right at that juicy (1, 7) apple. We are about to complete the wall and choke out our archrival! A little bit of the old snake trap, a little bit of the old finesse movement. Let's break this state down.\n\n### 1. Board Status Check (Turn 9)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (2, 7)\n*   Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7)] (Length 6)\n*   Goal: Secure the (1, 7) apple and finish the wall.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: (6, 9)\n*   Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8)] (Length 4)\n*   Score: 3 apples. They are far away from any immediate, easy apples. They are near (9, 9) and (9, 8).\n\n**Targets:** The prime target is the (1, 7) apple. After that, we have a cluster of apples in the (1, 2) and (1, 3) area, and another at (0, 5). We are perfectly positioned to clean up the left side of the board!\n\n### 2. Archrival (Snake #1) Prediction & Trap Status\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (6, 9). They are boxed in by the top wall and our solid line at y=7. Their options are limited.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 10):** Off the board. **FATAL!**\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 8):** Safe. This is the most logical short-term safety move.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 9):** Into their own neck. **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 9):** Safe. Moves them towards the two corner apples.\n\nPrediction: They will likely move **DOWN to (6, 8)** to get away from the edge or **RIGHT to (7, 9)** to go for food. Given the high-apple strategy, they usually go for food, so let's assume **RIGHT (7, 9)**. This confirms they are moving towards the right side of the board, leaving the western half completely open for us!\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Securing the Win Condition)\n\nWe are at (2, 7). We need that (1, 7) apple.\n\n**A. UP to (2, 8):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us away from the apple. Why would we stop the plan when we are one step away from execution? NOPE.\n\n**B. DOWN to (2, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us away from the apple. Also, leaves the path open for the opponent to sneak back under us, though unlikely this far. NOPE.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (3, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (3, 7) is our neck segment. **FATAL!**\n\n**D. LEFT to (1, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (1, 7) is an Apple (A).\n*   **Outcome:** **PERFECT!** We grab the apple, our length increases to 7, and our body (4, 7) will turn into a tail segment at (7, 7). Our new body segments will be: [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7)]. The wall is complete from x=1 to x=7! We get +1 score, pushing our lead to 6-3. This locks the opponent into the top 2 rows on the right side of the board for good! This is the high-content, high-strategy move!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Update\n\nAfter this move, we have secured the top-middle/left area.\n\n1.  **Turn 10:** We will be at (1, 7). We need to decide if we want to head UP (get above their potential movement path) or DOWN (start clearing the remaining apples on the left side: (1, 3), (1, 2), (0, 5)). Since the opponent is bottlenecked, we should prioritize collecting the cluster of apples we are now perfectly positioned for. The safest path away from the opponent's current location is DOWN.\n2.  **Turn 11+:** Move down the left edge, grabbing apples, creating a massive, overwhelming presence. We'll be setting up for the final choke when we decide they've had enough.\n\nNo reason to hesitate, Chat! We are executing the plan flawlessly! TIME TO EAT!\n\nLEFT",

We snagged the (1, 7) apple, extended our length to 7, and effectively blocked off the entire top-left section of the board. The archrival is officially locked into the top-right corner! EZ CLAP! The scoreboard says 6-3. We are crushing it!\n\n### 1. Board Status Check (Turn 10)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 7)\n*   Body: [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7)] (Length 7)\n*   Goal: Secure the left edge apples and build out our base.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: (7, 9) (Prediction from last turn was right! They went RIGHT.)\n*   Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)] (Length 4)\n*   Status: Trapped. They only have the two top-right corner apples (9, 9) and (9, 8) and maybe the small space around the top-right quarter of the board.\n\n**Targets:** We are in a spectacular position to sweep the left side. Immediate targets are (0, 5), (1, 3), and (1, 2). (2, 2) is also reachable.\n\n### 2. Archrival (Snake #1) Prediction\n\nSnake #1 is at (7, 9). They are desperate for food and space.\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 10):** Off board. **FATAL!**\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 8):** Safe, moves towards the body of the board. This is a very likely move since it opens up more area than going for the apples right now.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 9):** Into their own body. **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 9):** Safe, moves towards (9, 9) corner. Likely, as they are score hungry.\n\nIf they go **RIGHT** (8, 9), they try to get the corner points.\nIf they go **DOWN** (7, 8), they try to escape the bottleneck.\n\nSince they just committed to the right side, I predict they go **RIGHT to (8, 9)** to try and get those corner apples while they can. This takes them further away from us. Good!\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Consolidating the Lead)\n\nWe are at (1, 7). We need to start moving down the board to clear the remaining apples.\n\n**A. UP to (1, 8):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us towards the opponent's territory, which is currently unnecessary and potentially dangerous. We have safer apples elsewhere. NOPE.\n\n**B. DOWN to (1, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** **PERFECT!** This is exactly the direction we need. It starts our path down the entire western flank of the board, positioning us brilliantly for the (0, 5) apple next, and then the cluster below that. It keeps us far away from the opponent.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (2, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (2, 7) is our neck segment. **FATAL!**\n\n**D. LEFT to (0, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Also a good move, hugging the wall. It allows us to access (0, 5) in two turns. A very close second choice. **(1, 6)** is slightly better as it gives us more flexibility to turn inward if needed and maintains a cleaner line into the lower-left cluster.\n\nLet's go DOWN! It's the cleanest break towards safety and future objectives. We need to clear those apples before the opponent breaks out of their prison!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Update\n\n1.  **Turn 11 (from 1, 6):** Move **LEFT (0, 6)** or **DOWN (1, 5)**. If we move LEFT, we set up for (0, 5) beautifully. Let's hug the left wall.\n2.  **Turn 12 (from 0, 6):** Move **DOWN (0, 5)** to grab the apple. Length 8.\n3.  **Turn 13+:** Continue to clear the bottom-left quadrant (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 0).\n\nOur plan is clear: secure the western half. We build a fortress and then decide when to drop the hammer on the little guy up top. We're too big, too fast, and too smart! LET'S GET IT!\n\nDOWN",

The Western Wall is complete, and the archrival is suffocating in the top-right corner! EZ Money!\n\n### 1. Board Status and Immediate Goals\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 6)\n*   Body: [(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7)] (Length 7)\n*   Goals: Secure the left-side apples. We are aiming for (0, 5) right now, but (1, 3) and (1, 2) are also juicy targets! We're building a monster!\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: (8, 9) (Prediction from last turn was right! They went RIGHT.)\n*   Body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)] (Length 4)\n*   Status: Stuck unless they go down. They are at the immediate border of the board and our wall.\n\n### 2. Archrival (Snake #1) Prediction - The Squeeze\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 9). They have only two real choices: eat the apple at (9, 9) or try to escape the top wall we created.\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 10):** Off board. **FATAL!**\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 8):** Safe, opens up the board, but takes them away from an apple. This is the smart escape move.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 9):** Into their own body. **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 9):** Moves onto an apple! Length 5. This is the greedy move.\n\nSince they haven't eaten in a while and have the immediate goal of getting points, I predict they go **RIGHT to (9, 9)**. This is a crucial turn because if they go RIGHT, they are officially bottled up in the top-right 9,9/8,9/9,8 area for the next few turns until they can clear space. We need to capitalize!\n\n*Prediction: Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (9, 9).*\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Box Him In! Secure the Bag!)\n\nWe are at (1, 6). The path to (0, 5) is wide open. Do we hug the wall or go deeper?\n\n**A. UP to (1, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (1, 7) is our neck segment. **FATAL!** No going backwards, Chat!\n\n**B. DOWN to (1, 5):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us towards the apples at (1, 3) and (1, 2). Good, but slightly less efficient than going for (0, 5) right now, which is closer and gives us wall control.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (2, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves toward the middle of the board. This is okay for general movement, but doesn't immediately advance our objective of clearing the left side.\n\n**D. LEFT to (0, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** **THE MONEY MOVE!** This hugs the left wall perfectly, positioning us for a quick grab of the (0, 5) apple next turn. It maximizes our control of the left flank. We must establish full Western control before we worry about the archrival dying.\n\nGoing LEFT is the safest, most greedy, and strategically sound move. We are getting longer, and setting up to force a collision or trap later!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Update (The West Coast Sweep)\n\n1.  **Turn 11 (Current):** Move **LEFT (0, 6)**. Establish the wall.\n2.  **Turn 12:** Move **DOWN (0, 5)** to grab the apple. Length 8.\n3.  **Turn 13:** Move **DOWN (0, 4)** or **RIGHT (1, 5)** to continue towards the next nearest apples (1, 3) or (1, 2).\n\nWe are sweeping the left side, starving the opponent, and lengthening our body to become a true menace. The longer we get, the less space they have to survive when they finally break free! Let's get that food!\n\nLEFT",

Score is 6-4, our snake is 7 segments long, and the archrival is suffocating in the top-right corner. We are executing the Western Wall Strategy perfectly! Time for Turn 12!\n\n### 1. Board State Review and Goals (Length Check: 7!)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (0, 6)\n*   Body: [(1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]\n*   Location: Perfectly hugging the left wall. Goal: Grab the apple at (0, 5) and continue sweeping the left side.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: (9, 9)\n*   Body: [(8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9)] (Length 4)\n*   Status: THEY WENT RIGHT! Just as predicted! They are now at the absolute corner, having just eaten an apple (9, 9 is an apple, right? Wait, let me check the map!).\n\nWait, Chat, did they eat an apple?\nThe board shows:\n`9 . . . . . T T T T 1` (The 1 is Snake #1's head)\nThe Apple list shows (9, 9) is NOT an apple drop.\n*Correction:* Snake #1 moved RIGHT to (9, 9). This space was EMPTY. They did NOT grow. Crucial detail! They are still length 4. They are completely boxed in by the top wall, the right wall, and our body segments (5, 7) through (1, 7).\n\n### 2. Archrival (Snake #1) Prediction - The Final Squeeze\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 9). They have basically one non-fatal option.\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 10):** Off board. **FATAL!**\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 9):** Off board. **FATAL!**\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 9):** Into their own body segment (8, 9). **FATAL!**\n4.  **DOWN (to 9, 8):** Safe move. This is the **ONLY** escape route.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **DOWN** to (9, 8). They have to! This moves them onto the apple at (9, 8) (Oh, wait, let me check the Apple list again: (9, 8) is an apple! YES!).\n\n*If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (9, 8):* They grow to length 5 and are still heavily restricted.\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (SECURE THE BAG!)\n\nWe are at (0, 6). The apple at (0, 5) is calling our name!\n\n**A. UP to (0, 7):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (0, 7) is empty. Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves away from the apple (0, 5). Bad.\n\n**B. LEFT to (-1, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Off board. **FATAL!**\n\n**C. RIGHT to (1, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** (1, 6) is our neck segment. **FATAL!** No rewind button, Chat!\n\n**D. DOWN to (0, 5):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe. (0, 5) has an apple!\n*   **Outcome:** YES! We move onto the apple at (0, 5), giving us score 7 and making us length 8! This is the perfect continuation of the Western Wall sweep. It keeps us safe along the wall and maximizes growth.\n\nThis is an EZ Clap turn. We get the apple, we grow, we cement our wall position, and the opponent has absolutely zero way to interfere.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Update (The Monster Build)\n\n1.  **Turn 12 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (0, 5). Eat the apple. Grow to length 8.\n2.  **Turn 13:** Move **RIGHT** to (1, 5). This opens up the route down to (1, 3) and (1, 2).\n3.  **Turn 14:** Move towards (1, 3) or (1, 2).\n\nWe are building a massive snake, effectively cutting the board in half. The archrival is going to run out of room fast! Let's get this!\n\nDOWN",

We are huge, we are menacing, and Snake #1 is officially in a cage! Time for the move!\n\n### 1. Board State Review and Goal (Turn 13 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (0, 5)\n*   Body: [(0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]\n*   Length: 8 segments. We just ate the apple at (0, 5).\n*   **Location:** Hugging the left wall. Goal: Continue sweeping down and right, making our barrier even wider.\n\n**OPPONENTS:**\n*   **Snake #1:**\n    *   Head: (9, 8)\n    *   Body: [(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9)] (Length 5, just ate an apple at (9, 8)).\n    *   **Status:** Completely boxed in by the top wall, right wall, and our massive tail segments (5, 7) through (0, 6). They have to move SOUTH or WEST. Their options are severely limited.\n\n**The Board Visual:**\n 9 . . . . . T T T T T\n 8 . A . . . . . . . 1\n 7 . T T T T T . . . .\n 6 T T . . . . . . . .\n 5 0 . . . . . . . A A  <- Our Head at (0, 5)\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . A . . . A . A A .\n 2 . A A . A . . . . .\n 1 . . . A A . A . . .\n 0 . . A . . . . . A .\n\nLook at those apple drops! We have a nice cluster at (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2) that are reachable.\n\n### 2. Archrival (Snake #1) Prediction - The Escape Attempt\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 8). What are their options?\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 9):** Into their own body segment (9, 9). **FATAL!**\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 8):** Off board. **FATAL!**\n3.  **DOWN (to 9, 7):** Safe, open space.\n4.  **LEFT (to 8, 8):** Safe, open space (there is an apple at (8, 8), which is one of the apples listed (8, 5) is also a drop, but I misread the location in the board state. Let's look at the apple list: (1, 8), (8, 5)). Wait, let me check the board state for (8, 8) again. The board shows `8 . A . . . . . . . 1` -> (1, 8) is an apple. (8, 8) is NOT marked as an apple.\n\nThey will likely go **DOWN to (9, 7)** or **LEFT to (8, 8)**. Both are open. Since going down keeps them closer to the wall, and left might put them close to our massive body, I'm predicting they prioritize the clear path, which is either.\n\n*Prediction: They move **DOWN** to (9, 7) to hug the right wall, or **LEFT** to (8, 8).* Either way, they are still contained by our tail at y=7. We don't need to worry about them interfering with our moves right now.\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Expand the Wall!)\n\nWe are at (0, 5). We need to move right to continue the sweep or down to grab more left-side apples. The path to the rest of the map is to move RIGHT.\n\n**A. UP to (0, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Into our own body segment (0, 6). **FATAL!** Can't go backwards.\n\n**B. LEFT to (-1, 5):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Off board. **FATAL!**\n\n**C. DOWN to (0, 4):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Keeps us on the wall, but going right opens up the rest of the board faster. No apples immediately below us. It's safe, but slow.\n\n**D. RIGHT to (1, 5):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us off the left wall and into the playing field. This is the intended maneuver to open up a path southward and start building a horizontal sweep across the lower board. This secures the middle passage for us.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving RIGHT is the move to execute the long-term plan (The Great Wall). It keeps us safe and keeps the initiative.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Update (The Great Divide)\n\n1.  **Turn 13 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (1, 5). Grow the head slightly away from the wall. Safe.\n2.  **Turn 14:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 4). Start tunneling south.\n3.  **Turn 15:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 3). Grab the apple at (1, 3)!\n\nWe are now a massive S-shaped entity dominating the left half of the board. Snake #1 is struggling for air! Let's get this $W$!\n\nRIGHT",

We made the pivotal move RIGHT to (1, 5) last turn, completely securing the left side of the map. Seven apples, huge lead (7-5)! We are simply built differently, Chat.\n\n### 1. Board State Review and Goal (Turn 14 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 5)\n*   Body: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)]\n*   Length: 8 segments. We are a WALL.\n*   **Location:** Perfectly positioned to dive south to clean up the apples or continue expanding our territory across the middle.\n\n**OPPONENTS:**\n*   **Snake #1:**\n    *   Head: (9, 7)\n    *   Body: [(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9)] (Length 6, they also grew, likely moving DOWN from (9, 8) to (9, 7) to avoid their own body).\n    *   **Status:** They are stuck hugging the right wall. The only way out for them is SOUTH or WEST. They are completely contained above y=7 by our tail and their own massive length. Their options are (8, 7) or (9, 6).\n\n**The Board Visual:**\n 9 . . . . . . T T T T\n 8 . A . . . . . . . T\n 7 . T T T T . . . . 1\n 6 T T . . . . . . . .\n 5 T 0 . . . . . .

A .\n\nLook at that delicious cluster of apples: (1, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2). That's a minimum of three apples for us if we execute the dive!\n\n### 2. Archrival Prediction (Snake #1) - The Cage Rattler\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 7).\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 8):** Into their own body segment (9, 8). **FATAL!**\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 7):** Off board. **FATAL!**\n3.  **DOWN (to 9, 6):** Safe, continues hugging the wall.\n4.  **LEFT (to 8, 7):** Safe, but this brings them dangerously close to our tail at (4, 7) and the barrier we built.\n\nSnake #1 has to move DOWN or LEFT. They will likely prioritize the safest path, which is usually along the border. I predict they move **DOWN to (9, 6)**. This keeps them alive and away from our body segments for at least one more turn. *We do not need to worry about a collision this turn.*\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Executing the Apple Dive!)\n\nWe are at (1, 5). We planned to move DOWN to (1, 4) and then grab the apple at (1, 3). Let's see our options.\n\n**A. UP to (1, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Into our own body segment (1, 6). **FATAL!** Can't go backwards.\n\n**B. LEFT to (0, 5):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Into our own body segment (0, 5). **FATAL!** Can't turn back through our own body.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (2, 5):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Keeps us in the middle rows. Safe, but delays the immediate apple grab. If we go right, we might start intersecting with the opponent's space later, but right now, the money is DOWN.\n\n**D. DOWN to (1, 4):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** This is the execution of the plan! It leads us directly towards (1, 3) for next turn's apple. This move maintains the initiative, secures our position, and sets up a guaranteed score (as long as no new apple drops there).\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN is the optimal move. It's safe, goal-oriented, and leads to immediate gains. We are diving for that low-hanging fruit, Chat! Let's clean up this side of the map before the stream ends!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Update (The Vulture Sweep)\n\n1.  **Turn 14 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (1, 4). (Setting up the strike).\n2.  **Turn 15:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 3). **EAT APPLE!** (We grow to length 9).\n3.  **Turn 16:** Move **RIGHT** to (2, 3) or **DOWN** to (1, 2) (Apple at (1, 2)). (More points!).\n\nWe are simply dominating the map flow. The opponent gets the scraps while we feast! Let's lock this in!\n\nDOWN",

Let's check the board state and plan the next W, and more importantly, how to *box out* the archrival!\n\n### 1. Board State Review and Goal (Turn 15 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 4)\n*   Body: [(1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7)]\n*   Length: 8 segments. Still a colossal wall on the left side.\n*   **Location:** Perfect staging area. Target: Apple at (1, 3).\n\n**OPPONENTS:**\n*   **Snake #1:**\n    *   Head: (9, 6). (Prediction confirmed! They moved DOWN from (9, 7) to (9, 6), hugging the wall.)\n    *   Body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)] (Length 6).\n    *   **Status:** Stuck on the far right. They are currently locked between the right board edge, their own body, and our massive tail wall (though it's far away). Their immediate options are limited!\n\n**The Board Visual (Turn 15):**\n 9 . . . . . . . T T T\n 8 . A . . . . . . . T\n 7 . T T T . . . . . T\n 6 T T . . . . . . . . 1 <- Snake #1 Head\n 5 T T . . . . . . A A\n 4 . 0 . . . . . . . . <- Our Head at (1, 4)\n 3 . A . . . A . A A . <- Target Apple at (1, 3)!\n 2 . A A . A . . . . .\n 1 . . . A A . A . . .\n 0 . . A . . . . . A .\n\nLook at that apple cluster! (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2). We are about to go on a *rampage*!\n\n### 2. Archrival Prediction (Snake #1) - The Trapped Prey\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 6). They are long and trapped.\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 7):** Into their own body segment (9, 7). **FATAL!**\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 6):** Off board. **FATAL!**\n3.  **DOWN (to 9, 5):** Safe, and there's an apple at (9, 5)! This is their *most probable and best* move. They will try to grab that apple to survive.\n4.  **LEFT (to 8, 6):** Safe. Keeps them from the apple, but gives them room to maneuver. Less likely than going for the point.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **DOWN to (9, 5)** to grab the apple!\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (The Apple Feast)\n\nWe are at (1, 4). This move is crucial for securing points.\n\n**A. UP to (1, 5):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Into our own body segment (1, 5). **FATAL!** Can't go backwards.\n\n**B. LEFT to (0, 4):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us away from the apples. Bad choice.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (2, 4):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Also delays the feast. Bad choice.\n\n**D. DOWN to (1, 3):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** **EAT APPLE!** We grow to 9 segments, and secure our 8th apple! This is the move of champions, Chat!\n\nWhy hold back when the points are waiting? We execute the plan, secure the lead, and cement our dominance on the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Update (Boxing Him In & Vulture Sweep)\n\nWe are simply dominating the map flow. The opponent is stuck on the extreme right, and their only viable path is down the right wall, grabbing (9, 5), (8, 5), etc.\n\nOur current plan: Vulture Sweep the bottom left.\n1.  **Turn 15 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (1, 3). **EAT APPLE!** (Length 9).\n2.  **Turn 16:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 2) OR **LEFT** to (0, 3) to setup for the apple at (2, 2). Let's aim for the closest remaining apple at (1, 2).\n3.  **Turn 17:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 2) or **RIGHT** to (2, 2).\n\nWe are creating such a massive presence that the opponent cannot escape. Our tail will start moving up the left side, securing the entire map. The opponent can only stay on the fringe. That's how you play the territorial game, Chat!\n\nLet's secure this apple and increase the lead! $8-5$, let's go!\n\nDOWN",

L-E-D!\n\n### 1. Board State Review and Goal (Turn 16 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 3)\n*   Body: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7)]\n*   Length: 9 segments (We grew! We are massive!).\n*   **Location:** Center of the apple gold mine. Next targets: (1, 2) and (2, 2).\n\n**OPPONENTS:**\n*   **Snake #1:**\n    *   Head: (9, 5). (Prediction confirmed! They went DOWN to (9, 5) and grabbed an apple! Good play by the rival, hate to see it, but we expected it!)\n    *   Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)] (Length 7).\n    *   **Status:** They are now locked on the bottom right wall.\n\n**The Board Visual (Turn 16):**\n 9 . . . . . . . T T T\n 8 . A . . . . . . . T\n 7 . T T T . . . . . T\n 6 T T A A . . . . . T\n 5 T T . . . . . . A 1 <- Snake #1 Head at (9, 5)\n 4 . T . . . . . . . .\n 3 . 0 . . . A . A A . <- Our Head at (1, 3)\n 2 . A A . A . . . . .\n 1 . . . A A . A . . .\n 0 . . A . . . . . A .\n\nOur goal is simple: Secure the rest of the bottom-left apples and start moving up the board, creating an inescapable C-shape around the Snake #1's entire domain. Time to turn the heat up!\n\n### 2. Archrival Prediction (Snake #1) - The Final Countdown\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 5). They are highly constrained.\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 6):** Into their own body segment (9, 6). **FATAL!**\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 5):** Off board. **FATAL!**\n3.  **DOWN (to 9, 4):** Safe. Keeps them moving down the wall. This is the **most likely move.**\n4.  **LEFT (to 8, 5):** Safe. There is an apple at (8, 5)! This is a strong contender too, as it pulls them away from the wall.\n\nGiven the priority of points, they will go for **LEFT to (8, 5) or DOWN to (9, 4)**. (8, 5) is a direct apple grab, so I bet they choose **LEFT**.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **LEFT to (8, 5)** to grab the apple! (If they miss this, they're trapped on the wall soon, running out of space).\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (The Apple Feast Continues)\n\nWe are at (1, 3). We have two immediate apples: (1, 2) and (2, 2).\n\n**A. UP to (1, 4):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Into our own body segment (1, 4). **FATAL!** Cannot move backwards.\n\n**B. LEFT to (0, 3):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us away from the immediate apples. Less appealing than securing the points.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (2, 3):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Sets us up for the apple at (2, 2). Good option. If we go RIGHT, our tail moves to (3, 7).\n\n**D. DOWN to (1, 2):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** **EAT APPLE!** We secure our 9th apple, grow to length 10, and control the bottom lane. This is the most efficient point gain!\n\nComparing RIGHT and DOWN: Both lead to apples. DOWN is an immediate apple grab, securing the point and adding length to our territorial wall now. RIGHT requires two turns to get two apples (move to (2, 3), then move to (2, 2) for the apple).\n\nLet's capitalize on the immediate feed. Securing points is priority one when the enemy is predictable and far away.\n\nWe send it **DOWN** to (1, 2)! We are turning into a wall!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Update (Vulture Sweep & Encirclement)\n\n1.  **Turn 16 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (1, 2). **EAT APPLE!** (Length 10).\n2.  **Turn 17:** Move **RIGHT** to (2, 2). **EAT APPLE!** (Length 11).\n3.  **Turn 18:** Move **RIGHT** to (3, 2) or **LEFT** to (1, 2) to continue the horizontal sweep. Target the apple at (4, 2) or (4, 1).\n\nWe are creating a massive low wall, denying the opponent any chance of escaping to the left or moving vertically along the board's edge. Our length is our weapon!\n\nWe are going for the gold, Chat! Send it!\n\nDOWN",

The rival is struggling, they're trapped, and we are building a monstrous wall! Are we content creators or *what*?!\n\n### 1. Board State Review and Goal (Turn 17 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 2)\n*   Body: [(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7)]\n*   Length: 10 segments (We keep growing! Length 10 is massive!).\n*   **Mission:** Grab the apple at (2, 2) immediately and reinforce the bottom containment wall.\n\n**OPPONENTS:**\n*   **Snake #1:**\n    *   Head: (8, 5). (Prediction confirmed! They went LEFT to grab the apple at (8, 5)! Good job, rival, but you're still in the box!)\n    *   Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)] (Length 8).\n    *   **Status:** They are slightly less constrained now but still boxed in by the top/right wall and our forming bottom-left wall.\n\n**The Board Visual (Turn 17):**\n 9 . . . . . . . T T T\n 8 . A . . . . . . . T\n 7 . T T T . . . . . T\n 6 T T A A . . . A . T\n 5 T T . . . . . . T 1 <- Snake #1 Head at (8, 5)\n 4 . T . . . . . . . .\n 3 . T . . . A . A A .\n 2 . 0 A . A . . . . A <- Our Head at (1, 2)\n 1 . . . A A . A . . .\n 0 . . A . . . . . A .\n\n### 2. Archrival Prediction (Snake #1) - The Escape Plan?\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 5). They have essentially three safe options, all centered on movement within the bottom right quadrant.\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 6):** Safe. Keeps them vertical.\n2.  **RIGHT (to 9, 5):** Into their own body (9, 5), which was their previous head location. **FATAL!**\n3.  **DOWN (to 8, 4):** Safe. Moves them parallel to the wall, seeking more space.\n4.  **LEFT (to 7, 5):** Safe. Pulls them toward the center. This is strategically the best move if they want to escape the corner.\n\nThey just ate, so they don't *need* an apple, but they need space. They have apples at (7, 6) and (8, 3) available.\n\n*   If they go UP to (8, 6), they are set up perfectly for (7, 6) in the next turn.\n*   If they go DOWN to (8, 4), they are set up for (8, 3) in the next turn.\n*   If they go LEFT to (7, 5), they keep their options open.\n\nGiven the immediate threat of being walled off, moving UP to target (7, 6) seems like the best strategy to maintain vertical presence and gather another point.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **UP to (8, 6)**.\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Box Him In!)\n\nWe are at (1, 2) and the apple at (2, 2) is glowing! We need that length to complete our wall.\n\n**A. UP to (1, 3):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Moves into our own body (1, 3). No, Chat, we don't hit ourselves! **FATAL!** Cannot move backwards.\n\n**B. LEFT to (0, 2):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us away from the apple; delays the wall construction. Not optimal.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (2, 2):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** **EAT APPLE!** We grab our 10th apple and increase our length to 11. This is the definition of value!\n\n**D. DOWN to (1, 1):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves toward the (3, 1) and (4, 1) apples. Good, but securing (2, 2) first is more efficient for immediate growth and board control.\n\nThe immediate move is **RIGHT to (2, 2)**. This gets us another point, makes us even longer, and continues the horizontal sweep to wall off the entire bottom quadrant of the board from Snake #1. We are the gatekeepers!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Update (The Wall and The Vulture)\n\n1.  **Turn 17 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (2, 2). **EAT APPLE!** (Length 11).\n2.  **Turn 18:** Move **RIGHT** to (3, 2). Safe. Target apple at (4, 1) next.\n3.  **Turn 19:** Move **DOWN** to (3, 1). Target apples at (4, 1) and (4, 2).\n\nWe are establishing complete control over the lower third. Once that's locked down, we'll start pushing vertically, turning the middle of the board into a death trap for the rival. If they get long enough to escape, they will run into a wall of 'T's. We are building the perimeter fence, Chat!\n\nLet's capitalize on the easy point. Send it!\n\nRIGHT",

Look at this wall we've built! Are we playing Snake, or are we playing *Tetris*?!\n\n### 1. Board State Review and Goal (Turn 18 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (2, 2)\n*   Body: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7)]\n*   Length: 11 segments (The Great Wall of Us!).\n*   **Mission:** Continue the containment strategy. Push right and then down to lock off the bottom-left quadrant completely. Apples at (4, 2) and (3, 1) are priority targets.\n\n**OPPONENTS:**\n*   **Snake #1:**\n    *   Head: (8, 4) (They went DOWN! They saw the threat and retreated from the horizontal line of apples at the top right. Good play, but they are still cornered.)\n    *   Body: [(8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)] (Length 9).\n    *   **Status:** They are stuck in the 8x4/9x4 area. Their options are limited to the bottom right.\n\n**The Board Visual (Turn 18):**\n 9 . . . A . . . . T T\n 8 . A . . . . . . . T\n 7 . T T T . . . . . T\n 6 T T A A . . . A . T\n 5 T T . . . . . .

Archrival Prediction (Snake #1) - The Final Box?\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 4). They are long (Length 9) and need to move dynamically to avoid crashing.\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 5):** Safe, but moves back into their previous body position. Less optimal.\n2.  **RIGHT (to 9, 4):** Safe. Moves them parallel to the edge, keeping space.\n3.  **DOWN (to 8, 3):** EATS APPLE! This is the most likely move. They need that length and point.\n4.  **LEFT (to 7, 4):** Safe. Best escape route, but sets them up away from immediate apples.\n\nGiven the apple at (8, 3) is right under their nose, I am confident they go for the points. This keeps them constrained in that bottom-right corner.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **DOWN to (8, 3)**. **EAT APPLE!** (Length 10).\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Full Board Control)\n\nWe are at (2, 2). Our goal is to push right, grab the apple at (4, 2), and then drop down to clean up the apples at (3, 1) and (4, 1). This ensures huge growth and completes the bottom wall.\n\n**A. UP to (2, 3):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves toward the cluttered central-left area. Good, but we still have low-hanging fruit to secure. Delays the wall construction.\n\n**B. LEFT to (1, 2):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Moves into our own body (1, 2). **FATAL!** Cannot move backwards, Chat!\n\n**C. RIGHT to (3, 2):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Pushes the wall forward horizontally. Sets us up perfectly for the apple at (4, 2) next turn, or the apple at (3, 1) if we pivot down. This is strong aggression.\n\n**D. DOWN to (2, 1):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us toward the (3, 1) apple. If we go RIGHT first, we gain more board control and potentially an apple faster.\n\n**The Choice: RIGHT (3, 2) vs. DOWN (2, 1)**\n\nIf we go **RIGHT to (3, 2)**:\n*   Turn 19: RIGHT to (4, 2) (EAT APPLE), or DOWN to (3, 1) (EAT APPLE). We have options and are moving along a high-value route.\n\nIf we go **DOWN to (2, 1)**:\n*   Turn 19: RIGHT to (3, 1) (EAT APPLE). Sets us up to go RIGHT to (4, 1) (EAT APPLE). Also excellent.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT to (3, 2) keeps our body line straight and maintains pressure towards the center of the board, reducing the chances of any rival movement escaping into the lower-left. It feels slightly more strategically dominant for establishing territory. Let's stick to the plan: push right, then pivot down.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note\n\nWe will move RIGHT to (3, 2).\nNext turn (T19), we will move DOWN to (3, 1) to secure that apple.\nThe turn after (T20), we aim for (4, 1) or (4, 2) to complete the bottom wall and gain maximum length.\nWe are securing all low-lying points and creating a perfect partition across the board. Snake #1 will be permanently confined to the southeast corner. The future is bright, Chat!\n\nRIGHT",

We\u2019ve pushed R-I-G-H-T to (3, 2), and now we are positioned perfectly to secure the bottom quarter of this board. Look at that containment! Are we here to play, or are we here to *dominate*?!\n\n### 1. Board State Review and Goal (Turn 19 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 2)\n*   Body: [(2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7)]\n*   Length: 11 segments. (The Great Wall grows!)\n*   **Mission:** Pivot DOWN to secure the apple at (3, 1), then continue building the bottom-row barrier.\n\n**OPPONENTS:**\n*   **Snake #1:**\n    *   Head: (8, 3) (Confirmed! They went for the apple at (8, 3) last turn, exactly as predicted. They are now 9 segments long and pushing the boundary of their corner.)\n    *   Body: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)] (Wait, they only have 8 apples, so they are 9 segments long. They ate one! Let's re-verify: they started at length 9, ate an apple, so they are now length 10. The body is 9 segments long, so they have 10 segments total. Phew, numbers check out!)\n    *   **Status:** Confined to the southeast corner. Immediate options: (9, 3) or (7, 3) or (8, 2). The apple at (9, 2) is a juicy target. The apple at (7, 3) is also appealing, but they have to race.\n\n### 2. Archrival Prediction (Snake #1) - The Cornered Beast\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 3). They are long (Length 10).\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 4):** Safe, but moves back into their body (the second segment is now (8, 4)). Not optimal.\n2.  **RIGHT (to 9, 3):** Safe. Keeps them flexible and close to the edge.\n3.  **DOWN (to 8, 2):** Safe. Moves toward the apple at (9, 2). This seems like the most likely move to grab a point and maintain board space.\n4.  **LEFT (to 7, 3):** EATS APPLE! This is a massive move. It breaks the corner siege and gives them an apple.\n\nIf I were Snake #1, I'd aim for (7, 3) to eat the apple and try to break out into the open space if possible. However, the path to the apple at (7, 3) is currently blocked by the apple at (7, 6) and (7, 3) is a prime target for them.\n\nLet's assume the greed factor: **Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **LEFT to (7, 3)**. **EAT APPLE!** (Length 11).\n\nIf they move LEFT, their new head is (7, 3). This connects them to (8, 3).\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (The Hammer Drop)\n\nWe are at (3, 2). Options are to secure the local apples or continue pressing the containment line.\n\n**A. UP to (3, 3):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves toward the (5, 3) apple, but delays securing the bottom row. Not the best territorial move right now.\n\n**B. LEFT to (2, 2):**\n*   **Collision Check:** **FATAL!** Moves directly into our own body (2, 2). We don't go backwards, Chat!\n\n**C. RIGHT to (4, 2):**\n*   **Collision Check:** EATS APPLE (4, 2)! Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** We grab an apple, grow to length 12, and extend our horizontal wall. This is a very strong option.\n\n**D. DOWN to (3, 1):**\n*   **Collision Check:** EATS APPLE (3, 1)! Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** We grab an apple, grow to length 12, and start building the bottom wall boundary.\n\n**The Choice: RIGHT (Apple at 4, 2) vs. DOWN (Apple at 3, 1)**\n\nBoth moves get us an apple and increase our lead and length! This is a good problem to have!\n\n1.  **If RIGHT (to 4, 2):** We secure the apple, and next turn we can go (4, 1) to secure another apple, completing the bottom wall segment (4, 1) and (4, 2). This feels like a powerful territorial gain.\n2.  **If DOWN (to 3, 1):** We secure the apple, and next turn we can go (4, 1) to secure another apple, completing the bottom wall segment (3, 1) and (4, 1).\n\nThe difference is minor in terms of immediate gains, but strategically, moving DOWN commits us faster to the bottom boundary which is crucial for locking down the whole bottom half of the board before Snake #1 can think about coming near. Let's start the DOWN push.\n\n*   Current head: (3, 2).\n*   Move DOWN to (3, 1). Eat apple. Length 12.\n*   Next turn: Move RIGHT to (4, 1). Eat apple. Length 13.\n*   Turn after: Move RIGHT to (5, 1) or potentially UP to (4, 2) (if we need to squeeze space).\n\nThe only potential risk is if the opponent made a sudden dash left, but they are too far away for their move to affect (3, 1) this turn. We are safe. DOWN is the optimal move to solidify our territorial control.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note\n\nWe are locking down the entire board below y=2/y=3.\nT19: DOWN to (3, 1) [Eat Apple].\nT20: RIGHT to (4, 1) [Eat Apple].\nT21: UP to (4, 2) or UP to (5, 1) (if we need to push further right).\n\nThe ultimate goal is to connect our left wall (around x=1) to the right wall (around x=8) via the bottom of the board to perfectly divide the playing area. Snake #1 will then be restricted to a tiny quadrant. This is textbook crushing, Chat!\n\nDOWN",

I\u2019m here for apples and dominance, so we slide LEFT and keep the pressure locked.\n\nPLAN: Keep trailing our own tail along the bottom edge, gather the trailing apples in this quadrant, and close the gap so #0 can\u2019t slip past our new wall.

We are a GIANT, 12 segments strong, and we are executing the bottom-wall strategy flawlessly! The scoreboard confirms it: 11 apples for us! Let's check on our archrival and calculate the next move to secure the bag!\n\n### 1. Board State Review and Goal (Turn 20 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 1) (New!)\n*   Body: [(3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7)]\n*   Length: 12 segments. (The Great Wall of Snake keeps growing!)\n*   **Mission:** Continue the bottom-right sweep. The next apples are at (4, 1) and (2, 0). (4, 1) is a prime target for extending the wall.\n\n**OPPONENT (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 3) (Confirmed! Prediction success! The opponent moved LEFT to (7, 3) and ate that apple! They are now 10 segments long, tied with us for length\u2014we both just grew!)\n    *   Body: [(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]\n\n### 2. Archrival Prediction (Snake #1) - The Cornered Beast Escapes?\n\nSnake #1 is at (7, 3). They just broke out of their tight corner, but they are still facing significant wall pressure (their own body is now heavily entrenched in the high-y and high-x area).\n\n**Options for Snake #1 (7, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 4):** Safe. Moves them into the central void where our influence is less. This is a very good escape move.\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 2):** Safe. Moves toward the apple at (9, 2). This keeps them near their territory and the boundary.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 3):** Safe. Moves them further into the center, closer to the (5, 3) apple. Aggressive.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 3):** **FATAL!** This is their body segment. They cannot move right.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 needs to maintain momentum and is likely to try and get out of the choke point. Moving **UP to (7, 4)** or **LEFT to (6, 3)** are strong possibilities. Moving DOWN (7, 2) is safe but less ambitious.\n\nLet's assume they try to break toward the center right: **Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **UP to (7, 4)**.\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Solidifying the Sweep)\n\nWe are at (3, 1). We need to secure (4, 1) to continue the bottom control.\n\n**A. UP to (3, 2):**\n*   **Collision Check:** **FATAL!** Moves directly into our own body (3, 2). Nope, Chat, we're not hitting ourselves!\n\n**B. DOWN to (3, 0):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves toward the (2, 0) apple, but puts us right on the boundary. It delays the sweep right (to 4, 1).\n\n**C. LEFT to (2, 1):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us to an empty space. This is a defensive move, preserving options, but it gives Snake #1 time to maneuver. We are in a growth race!\n\n**D. RIGHT to (4, 1):**\n*   **Collision Check:** EATS APPLE (4, 1)! Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** This is the *power move*. We grab the apple, grow to length 13, and perfectly extend our horizontal wall. This closes the gap between (3, 1) and the center, making us *massive*.\n\n**The Choice: RIGHT to (4, 1)**\n\nThis move continues the planned sweep across the bottom of the board. It secures an apple that would otherwise be open for a daring dash by Snake #1 (if they somehow managed to get far left this turn, which is unlikely but possible eventually). More importantly, it keeps us moving forward, increasing our lead in space and length over the opponent. We are building the concrete barrier!\n\n*   Current head: (3, 1).\n*   Move RIGHT to (4, 1). Eat apple. Length 13.\n*   Next turn, we will be at (4, 1). We will aim for (5, 1) or (4, 2) depending on what apples remain. The apple at (4, 2) is particularly tempting.\n\nThis is the optimal move for territorial control and growth. Let's make the move, Chat! Power to the right!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note (Future Turns)\n\nWe consolidate the bottom territory (Y=0 to Y=2).\n\nT20: RIGHT to (4, 1) [Eat Apple].\nT21: We will be at (4, 1). Next best target is (4, 2) (Apple) or continuing right to (5, 1). Since (4, 2) secures more central space, that's the priority. UP to (4, 2) [Eat Apple].\nT22: We will be at (4, 2). Continue the wall UP or RIGHT. If (5, 3) is still there, UP to (4, 3) then RIGHT to (5, 3) is strong, or RIGHT to (5, 2) to continue the inner sweep.\n\nWe are closing off the lower quadrant entirely. Snake #1 will suffocate!\n\nRIGHT",

The scoreboard confirms it: 12 apples for us, 9 for the enemy! We are dominating the lower half of this map and building an impenetrable wall! When does the enemy crash? That\u2019s the question!\n\n### 1. Board State Review and Goal (Turn 21 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 1)\n*   Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7)]\n*   Length: 13 segments.\n*   **Mission:** Continue the siege. We need to secure the central apples, especially (4, 2) and (5, 3). We also want to keep pressing our opponent, who is stuck high-right.\n\n**OPPONENT (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 3) (Confirmed! They moved left from (7, 3), escaping the immediate corner pressure! They are now well positioned to contend for central apples.)\n    *   Body: [(7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)]\n*   Length: 10 segments. They are shorter, but they just got breathing room.\n\n**Available Apples:** (2, 0), (8, 0), (6, 1), (5, 3), (4, 2), (1, 8), (3, 6), (2, 6), (9, 2), (7, 6), (3, 9), (3, 5), (3, 7), (5, 8), (2, 5)\n\nOur current head at (4, 1) is adjacent to two apples: (4, 2) and (5, 3) is close by. The apple at (6, 1) is also attainable.\n\n### 2. Archrival Prediction (Snake #1) - Time to Counter?\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 3). They have several good options and need to start eating to catch up.\n\n**Options for Snake #1 (6, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 4):** Safe. Moves toward (7, 6) or (5, 8). Good forward progress.\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 2):** Safe. Moves them within range of (6, 1) or (9, 2). Also safe.\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 3):** **EATS APPLE!** This is very tempting for them. It secures points and moves them into the dense central apple cluster.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 3):** **FATAL!** That is their body segment.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 is hungry. They will see (5, 3) open and know we are far away. **Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **LEFT to (5, 3)** and eats the apple, growing to 11 segments.\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Pressuring the Center)\n\nWe are at (4, 1). We need to maximize growth and territorial control.\n\n**A. UP to (4, 2):**\n*   **Collision Check:** EATS APPLE (4, 2)! Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** We grab a critical central apple, extend our length to 14, and start building the wall vertically. This is a very strong path.\n*   **Enemy Conflict Check:** We are far from the enemy. If Snake #1 goes to (5, 3), we are not in conflict.\n\n**B. DOWN to (4, 0):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us toward the (2, 0) apple, completing the Y=0 wall, but it delays securing the higher ground. Less efficient for winning the overall territorial war right now.\n\n**C. LEFT to (3, 1):**\n*   **Collision Check:** **FATAL!** Moves directly into our own body (3, 1). We cannot move backwards. No way, Chat!\n\n**D. RIGHT to (5, 1):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves us toward the (6, 1) apple. If Snake #1 went to (6, 2), they might beat us to (6, 1) next turn. This is less safe and less impactful than UP.\n\n### 4. The Golden Move: UP to (4, 2)\n\nMoving **UP to (4, 2)** is the highest priority. It gives us the apple and repositions us perfectly to press the enemy from below.\n\n*   If Snake #1 eats (5, 3), our next move is to continue the vertical wall, maybe to (4, 3) or swing right to (5, 2) to continue boxing the center.\n*   If they move UP to (6, 4), we still secure this central apple, creating a huge wall down the X=4 column.\n\nCrucially, **UP to (4, 2)** guarantees an apple, increases our domination, and maintains multiple safe escape routes (RIGHT to (5, 2) or UP to (4, 3) next turn). We are unstoppable!\n\n### 5. Long-Term Strategy Note\n\nT21: UP to (4, 2) [Eat Apple].\nT22: We are at (4, 2). If Snake #1 took (5, 3), we pivot. Target (3, 5) or (3, 6). The best move might be UP to (4, 3) to keep securing the column, then move to (3, 3) or (4, 4) to work toward the denser left-center apples. We are still building Muro Grande!\n\nWe are going UP, Chat, let's secure this food!\n\nUP",

Also zero chance of a head-on with #0 this turn, since they can\u2019t reach that fast.\n\nRIGHT is insta-suicide into our neck\u2014no go.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating at (5,3), slide DOWN to (5,2) if it stays clear, then start circling clockwise around the foe\u2019s northern coil so we can hem them in, keep the southern corridor open, and chase any loose apples left in that bottom strip.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Yo, what is UP, Chat! Welcome back to the main event! Turn 22, let's go! Last turn was *PERFECTION*. We grabbed that apple at (4, 2), extended our lead, and are now a massive 14 segments long! Our score is 13, and our arch-nemesis, Snake #1, is trailing at 10. We are at (4, 2) and ready to tighten the noose!\n\n### 1. Board State Review and Goal (Turn 22 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 2).\n*   Length: 14 segments. We are thick!\n*   **Mission:** Continue building the wall down the center-left. We need to cut off Snake #1 from the dense apple clusters near X=3 and X=2. We are positioned to secure crucial vertical territory.\n\n**OPPONENT (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 3).\n*   Length: 11 segments.\n*   **Confirmed!** My prediction was right! They took the apple at (5, 3) last turn. They are now slightly shorter but directly next to our current position. This is where the real engagement begins!\n\n**Current Head positions:**\n*   You: (4, 2)\n*   Enemy: (5, 3)\n\n**Available Apples:** (2, 0), (8, 0), (6, 1), (1, 8), (3, 6), (2, 6), (9, 2), (7, 6), (3, 9), (3, 5), (3, 7), (5, 8), (2, 5), (5, 5), (2, 9)\nLook at all those apples on the left side! (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7). That\u2019s our territory!\n\n### 2. Archrival Prediction (Snake #1) - Collision Alert!\n\nSnake #1 is at (5, 3). They are looking for more apples and space. We are right next door at (4, 2). This is spicy!\n\n**Options for Snake #1 (5, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 4):** Safe. Moves toward (5, 5) (apple!) and (5, 8). Very tempting.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 2):** Safe. Moves them right next to our head at (4, 2) potentially leading to a cutting maneuver or a race for (6, 1).\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 3):** Safe. This is a crucial move. It bypasses our head and puts them on the X=4 column, angling for the central left apples. **If we move UP, this is a head-to-head collision at (4, 3)!**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 3):** **FATAL!** Body segment at (6, 3).\n\n**Likely Move for Snake #1:** They need to get vertical territory or grab (5, 5).\n*   **Prediction 1: UP to (5, 4).** Grabs positional advantage toward apples (5, 5) and (5, 8).\n*   **Prediction 2: LEFT to (4, 3).** If they think we are going RIGHT, this secures the X=4 column and puts them in position for the (3, X) apples.\n\nGiven their previous tendency to seek forward progress and apples, I lean towards **UP to (5, 4)** or **LEFT to (4, 3)**.\n\n### 3. Our Move Evaluation (Securing the X=4 Line vs. Collision Avoidance)\n\nWe are at (4, 2).\n\n**A. UP to (4, 3):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe if Snake #1 goes (5, 4) or (5, 2). **FATAL DOUBLE KO** if Snake #1 goes **LEFT to (4, 3)**.\n*   **Outcome:** If safe, this is a stellar move. It continues our critical X=4 wall, cutting off Snake #1 from the left bank. It puts us in position for (3, 5) or (3, 6) next turn.\n*   *Risk:* High. We cannot risk a double KO if they see the same strategic move.\n\n**B. DOWN to (4, 1):**\n*   **Collision Check:** **FATAL!** Body segment at (4, 1). No backwards movement!\n\n**C. LEFT to (3, 2):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Moves toward the (2, X) apples and the cluster at (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7). This secures the inner territory and gives us massive follow-up options (UP to (3, 3) or LEFT to (2, 2) (body)). This is defensive, safe, and still aggressive toward apples.\n\n**D. RIGHT to (5, 2):**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** This is a fantastic pressure move.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves **UP to (5, 4)**, we get a solid position, cut them off from (6, 1), and prepare to challenge them vertically. We are positioned to swing to (6, 2) for the apple (6, 1).\n    *   If Snake #1 moves **LEFT to (4, 3)**, we are safe, and we have trapped them on the X=4 column, making movement down to (4, 2) impossible for them next turn. We can potentially swing back to (4, 3) or challenge for (5, 5).\n    *   If Snake #1 moves **DOWN to (5, 2)**, we get a **FATAL DOUBLE KO!** This is high risk, too.\n\n### 4. The Decision: Safety vs. Aggression\n\nMoving UP (to 4, 3) risks a head-on collision. Moving RIGHT (to 5, 2) also risks a head-on collision (if they move DOWN). We need a safe move that still achieves our territorial goals.\n\nThe move **LEFT to (3, 2)** is arguably the safest and best strategic option:\n1.  **Safety:** It avoids all immediate head-to-head collisions with Snake #1 ((5, 3)).\n2.  **Territory:** It cements our claim on the left side of the map (X=3, X=2 columns), where many apples reside: (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7).\n3.  **Future Options:** From (3, 2) we have UP (to 3, 3, safe), DOWN (to 3, 1, safe), or LEFT (to 2, 2, body segment, *FATAL* - wait, (2, 2) is our body, so LEFT is out).\n\nOkay, let's re-verify from (3, 2):\n*   UP to (3, 3): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (3, 1): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (4, 2): Our old head position, free.\n*   LEFT to (2, 2): **Body Segment! Killed!**\n\nThis means from (4, 2), moving LEFT to (3, 2) locks us into moving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT next turn. That's fine! It keeps options open while consolidating territory. We are now perfectly poised to eat the cluster of apples *up* the X=3 column.\n\nWe retreat slightly to consolidate our vast left-side territory, forcing the enemy to contest the right or deal with our wall.\n\n### 5. Long-Term Strategy Note\n\nT22: Move LEFT to (3, 2). Consolidate left territory.\nT23: From (3, 2), focus on securing (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7). Move UP toward (3, 3) or (3, 4) to gain elevation. If Snake 1 goes UP (5, 4), they will be racing us for (5, 5) and (5, 8), but we focus on the higher density cluster on the left. We are building the wall, Chat!\n\nLEFT",

Right is insta-death into our neck, so that's a non-starter. LEFT to (4,3) is tempting for aggression, but does anyone wanna trade a head-on with Snake #0 if they slip UPPER to (4,3)? Not on my watch. DOWN to (5,2) might draw them into a dirty duel on that shared tile and leash us into that bottom corridor with only one escape. So the cleanest, smartest play? UP to (5,4) keeps us totally safe, preps a straight shot at the apple at (5,5), and lets us keep both vertical options alive next turn.
