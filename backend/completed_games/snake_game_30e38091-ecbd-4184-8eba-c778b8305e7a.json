Check if (8,5) is off the board or occupied by any snake's body. It is within bounds (y=5 is valid) and not occupied by any snake's body. Safe.\n2. **DOWN**: From (8,4) to (8,3). Check if (8,3) is off the board or occupied. It is within bounds and not occupied. Safe.\n3. **LEFT**: From (8,4) to (7,4). Check if (7,4) is off the board or occupied. It is within bounds and not occupied. Safe.\n4. **RIGHT**: From (8,4) to (9,4). Check if (9,4) is off the board or occupied. It is within bounds and not occupied. Safe.\n\nAll four directions are safe since there are no other snakes or bodies on the board yet.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- The closest apple to your snake is at (6,2) and (5,5), both at a Manhattan distance of 6 (for (6,2): |8-6| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4, and for (5,5): |8-5| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4).\n  - Correction: The Manhattan distance for (6,2) is |8-6| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4, and for (5,5) is |8-5| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4. Both are equally close.\n- The apple at (4,8) is also at a Manhattan distance of 4 (|8-4| + |4-8| = 4 + 4 = 8). Wait, let's recalculate:\n  - For (4,8): |8-4| + |4-8| = 4 + 4 = 8. That's incorrect, as (4,8) is actually at a Manhattan distance of |8-4| + |4-8| = 4 + 4 = 8. Wait, no, the Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. So for (4,8), the distance from (8,4) is |8-4| + |4-8| = 4 + 4 = 8. That's correct.\n  - The apple at (9,0) is at |8-9| + |4-0| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n  - The apple at (0,4) is at |8-0| + |4-4| = 8 + 0 = 8.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (6,2) and (5,5), both 4 units away.\n\n**Enemy Snake Position:**\n- The enemy snake is at (3,8). It is not in immediate danger of colliding with you, but its movement could potentially lead to a collision in future turns.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:**\n- Since both snakes are single segments, we need to prioritize reaching apples quickly without risking head-on collisions.\n- The apples at (6,2) and (5,5) are both reachable in 4 turns if we move directly toward them.\n- I will aim to move toward the apple at (5,5) first, as it seems more central and could provide more flexibility in future turns.\n- To reach (5,5), I need to move left and up. Specifically, from (8,4), moving left to (7,4) and then up to (7,5) would be a good start.\n\n### Decision Process:\n1. **UP**: Moves to (8,5). This is one step closer to the apple at (5,5) in the y-direction but not in the x-direction.\n2. **DOWN**: Moves to (8,3). This is away from the apple at (5,5) and doesn't seem strategic.\n3. **LEFT**: Moves to (7,4). This is one step closer to the apple at (5,5) in the x-direction.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moves to (9,4). This is away from the apple at (5,5) and doesn't seem strategic.\n\n**LEFT** is the best move to start heading toward the apple at (5,5).\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns:\n- **Turn 1**: Move LEFT to (7,4).\n- **Turn 2**: Move UP to (7,5).\n- **Turn 3**: Move LEFT to (6,5).\n- **Turn 4**: Move LEFT to (5,5) to collect the apple.\n\nThis plan should keep me alive and moving towards an apple efficiently.\n\nLEFT",

It could move in any direction, but:\n  - **UP**: (4,9) or (5,8) (if extending body).\n  - **DOWN**: (4,7) or (3,7) (if extending body).\n  - **LEFT**: (3,8) is already its body, so it would die if moving LEFT (into its own body).\n  - **RIGHT**: (5,8) (safe, no collision with you yet).\n\n**Collision Risk:**\n- If Snake #0 moves **UP** to (5,8), it would be adjacent to your snake (at (7,4)). Not immediate danger, but future turns must avoid trapping.\n- If Snake #0 moves **DOWN** to (4,7), it would be farther from you.\n- If Snake #0 moves **RIGHT** to (5,8), it would still not block your path to (6,2) or (5,5) yet.\n\n**Optimal Path to (5,5):**\n- Current position: (7,4).\n- Move sequence: **LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 UP \u2192 UP** (to (5,5)).\n  - Turn 1: (7,4) \u2192 (6,4) (LEFT).\n  - Turn 2: (6,4) \u2192 (5,4) (LEFT).\n  - Turn 3: (5,4) \u2192 (5,5) (UP).\n  - Turn 4: (5,5) \u2192 (5,6) (UP), but this misses the apple. Correction: **Turn 3** should be (5,4) \u2192 (5,5) (UP), and **Turn 4** is not needed since you\u2019d reach (5,5) on Turn 3.\n  - Wait, no: (7,4) \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (5,5) (3 turns total: LEFT, LEFT, UP).\n  - This is more efficient than the previous plan (LEFT, UP, LEFT, LEFT).\n\n**Optimal Path to (6,2):**\n- Current position: (7,4).\n- Move sequence: **LEFT \u2192 DOWN \u2192 DOWN** (to (6,2)).\n  - Turn 1: (7,4) \u2192 (6,4) (LEFT).\n  - Turn 2: (6,4) \u2192 (6,3) (DOWN).\n  - Turn 3: (6,3) \u2192 (6,2) (DOWN).\n  - Manhattan distance: 3 turns (same as (5,5)).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Both (6,2) and (5,5) are equally close (3 turns), but (5,5) is more central and may offer better long-term flexibility.\n- Moving toward (5,5) requires **LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 UP**, which is straightforward and avoids dead-ends.\n- Moving toward (6,2) requires **LEFT \u2192 DOWN \u2192 DOWN**, which is also safe but may limit future options if Snake #0 blocks the downward path.\n\n**Future Considerations:**\n- Snake #0 is moving toward (5,8) or (4,7). If it moves to (5,8), it could later threaten your path to (5,5) if you\u2019re too slow.\n- Prioritize apples that are reachable in fewer turns or offer better positioning. (5,5) is slightly better here.\n\n### Decision Process:\n1. **UP**: Moves to (7,5). Not closer to (5,5) or (6,2). Less efficient.\n2. **DOWN**: Moves to (7,3). Moves away from both target apples. Not strategic.\n3. **LEFT**: Moves to (6,4). First step toward (5,5) or (6,2). Optimal for both paths.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moves to (8,4). Moves away from both target apples. Not strategic.\n\n**LEFT** is the best move to maintain flexibility and progress toward the closest apples.\n\n---\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns:\n- **Turn 1**: Move **LEFT** to (6,4).\n- **Turn 2**: Move **LEFT** to (5,4) (if no collision risk).\n- **Turn 3**: Move **UP** to (5,5) to collect the apple.\n- Avoid moves that trap you or limit future options. If Snake #0 moves aggressively toward (5,8), consider alternative paths like (6,2) or (9,0) if they become safer.\n\nLEFT",

It could move in any direction, but:\n  - **UP**: (5,9) or (6,8) (if extending body).\n  - **DOWN**: (5,7) or (4,7) (if extending body).\n  - **LEFT**: (4,8) is already its body, so it would die if moving LEFT (into its own body).\n  - **RIGHT**: (6,8) (safe, no collision with you yet).\n\n**Collision Risk:**\n- If Snake #0 moves **UP** to (6,8), it would be adjacent to your potential path to (5,5) but not immediate danger.\n- If Snake #0 moves **DOWN** to (5,7), it would be farther from you.\n- If Snake #0 moves **RIGHT** to (6,8), it would still not block your path to (6,2) or (5,5) yet.\n\n**Optimal Path to (5,5):**\n- Current position: (6,4).\n- Move sequence: **LEFT \u2192 UP** (to (5,5)).\n  - Turn 1: (6,4) \u2192 (5,4) (LEFT).\n  - Turn 2: (5,4) \u2192 (5,5) (UP).\n\n**Optimal Path to (6,2):**\n- Current position: (6,4).\n- Move sequence: **DOWN \u2192 DOWN** (to (6,2)).\n  - Turn 1: (6,4) \u2192 (6,3) (DOWN).\n  - Turn 2: (6,3) \u2192 (6,2) (DOWN).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Both (6,2) and (5,5) are equally close (2 turns), but (5,5) is more central and may offer better long-term flexibility.\n- Moving toward (5,5) requires **LEFT \u2192 UP**, which is straightforward and avoids dead-ends.\n- Moving toward (6,2) requires **DOWN \u2192 DOWN**, which is also safe but may limit future options if Snake #0 blocks the downward path.\n\n**Future Considerations:**\n- Snake #0 is moving toward (6,8) or (5,7). If it moves to (6,8), it could later threaten your path to (5,5) if you\u2019re too slow.\n- Prioritize apples that are reachable in fewer turns or offer better positioning. (5,5) is slightly better here.\n\n### Decision Process:\n1. **UP**: Moves to (6,5). Not closer to (5,5) or (6,2). Less efficient.\n2. **DOWN**: Moves to (6,3). First step toward (6,2). Optimal for that path.\n3. **LEFT**: Moves to (5,4). First step toward (5,5). Optimal for that path.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moves to (7,4). Moves away from both target apples. Not strategic.\n\nBetween **DOWN** and **LEFT**, **LEFT** is better because it moves you toward (5,5), which is more central and offers better long-term flexibility.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns:\n- **Turn 2**: Move **LEFT** to (5,4).\n- **Turn 3**: Move **UP** to (5,5) to collect the apple.\n- Avoid moves that trap you or limit future options. If Snake #0 moves aggressively toward (6,8), consider alternative paths like (6,2) or (9,0) if they become safer.\n\nLEFT",
