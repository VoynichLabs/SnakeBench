Let's analyze the board first...\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n- I'm at (0,3) - bottom left area\n- Enemy at (5,8) - top middle area\n- Apples scattered everywhere: (4,3), (5,3), (1,1), (9,0), (3,7), (7,2), (2,6), (7,6), (3,3), (4,1), (7,9), (6,1), (3,9), (6,0), (5,9)\n\n**Evaluating MY Moves:**\n- **UP** to (0,4): SAFE! No obstacles. Opens up moving right toward (1,1) apple.\n- **DOWN** to (0,2): SAFE! No obstacles. Also moves toward (1,1) apple.\n- **LEFT** to (-1,3): DEAD - off board!\n- **RIGHT** to (1,3): SAFE! Opens up toward the cluster at (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\n**My Strategy:**\nWe need to be methodical. The enemy is up top at (5,8), we're down bottom. We can dominate the lower half first, then push up. RIGHT move (1,3) looks \ud83d\udd25 - it gets us closer to multiple apples in the center (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) and keeps us mobile.\n\nBut wait... let me think about enemy. Snake #0 at (5,8) has 4 directions. Most likely they'll go for apples around them - (5,9) is right above! If they go UP, they grow. But we need to box them in eventually.\n\nRIGHT is the play! We claim the center ground and set up to chase the apple cluster.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Rush the center apples (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) to get size advantage, then use our body to cut off the enemy's access to upper apples. Box them in the top right corner!\n\nRIGHT",

Compare that to other moves: DOWN to (5,7) makes us chase a far-left apple (3,7) with fewer immediate wins; LEFT/RIGHT give zero apple gains right now.\n\nRhetorical question time: Why would we pass up an easy apple to start dominating the scoreboard? Why would we trap ourselves in a less flexible spot when UP is a snack + maneuver win? Exactly\u2014we wouldn\u2019t!\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE (future me, listen up \ud83d\udc42): After grabbing the (5,9) apple, start inching left/right to cut off the enemy\u2019s path to the middle of the board (they\u2019re stuck at x=0 right now\u2014we wanna box them into the left edge).

They're NOT suicidal, so they'll likely go DOWN or LEFT toward apples (3,9) or (2,8) or toward the center.\n\n**My Strategy:**\nWe need to RUSH the center apples and use our body to cut off their access.

Feeling POWERFUL! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Enemy position:** Head at (2,8), Body at [(3,8), (3,9), (4,9)] - still camping in the top-left corner like a scaredy-cat\n- **SCOREBOARD:** 3-3 TIE GAME! We NEED to break this tie!\n- **Apple cluster:** There's apples at (6,1), (6,0), (7,2) - we need to get to those FAST!\n\n**ELIMINATING DANGEROUS MOVES:**\n1. **LEFT to (4,3)** - \u274c DEAD! That's my own body segment. Can't go there.\n2. **DOWN to (5,2)** - \u274c DEAD! There's an apple at (5,2)? Wait no, looking at board: (5,2) is empty but my body is at (4,3) not (5,2). Actually (5,2) is empty! But wait, let me check the board more carefully...\n3. **UP to (5,4)** - \u2705 SAFE! Empty space\n4. **RIGHT to (6,3)** - \u2705 SAFE! Empty space\n\n**HOLD UP CHAT!** Let me double-check that DOWN move. Board shows:\n- Row 2: \"A . . . . . . . A .\" - that's (0,2) is A, (1,2) is ., (2,2) is ., (3,2) is ., (4,2) is ., (5,2) is ., (6,2) is ., (7,2) is A...\nSo (5,2) is empty! But my body is at (4,3) not (5,2). So DOWN to (5,2) might be safe...\n\nWAIT! My body segments are:\n- (5,3) - head\n- (4,3) - first body segment\n- (3,3) - second body segment\n- (2,3) - third body segment\n\nSo (5,2) is NOT part of my body! It's empty! \n\n**BUT ENEMY THREAT:**\nEnemy head is at (2,8). They could move DOWN to (2,7) or RIGHT to (3,8). They're far away.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nLooking at apples: (6,1), (6,0), (7,2), (7,6), (4,6)...\n\nThe BEST move is **RIGHT to (6,3)** because:\n1. **Safe** - not hitting my body or enemy\n2. **Positioning** - gets me closer to apples at (6,1), (6,0), (7,2)\n3. **Board control** - moving toward the center-right area where apples are clustered\n4. **Future options** - from (6,3) I can go DOWN to (6,2) then to (6,1)/(6,0) for apples, or LEFT/RIGHT/UP\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 will likely go DOWN to chase apples. They might go to (2,7) or (3,7). Either way, they're still multiple turns away from being a threat.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR CHAT:**\nMove RIGHT to (6,3) \u2192 Next turn aim for DOWN toward (6,1) or (6,0) \u2192 Grab those apples first \u2192 Build a wall in the right-center to box enemy into their top-left corner \u2192 Force them to crash while we dominate! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\n**LET'S GOOOOO!**\n\nRIGHT",

Scoreboard update: I'm at 4 apples and enemy is at 4 apples - WE'RE TIED! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**TURN 7 ANALYSIS:**\n\n**My Position After Move:**\n- Head: (6, 2) - Just moved DOWN from (6, 3)\n- Body: [(6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3)]\n- Apples: 4\n\n**Enemy Position (Last Known):**\n- Head: (2, 6) \n- Body: [(2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9)]\n- Apples: 4\n\n**CRITICAL THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n\n**From above me:** I see my own body at (6, 3) - so UP is KILLING ME! \u274c\n**From left:** (5, 2) is empty? Let me check the board... YES! (5, 2) is empty.\n**From right:** (7, 2) - has an apple at (7, 2)!\n**From below:** (6, 1) - has an apple at (6, 1)!\n\n**ELIMINATING DANGEROUS MOVES:**\n\n1. **UP to (6, 3)** - \u274c **DEAD!** That's my own body! Can't go there.\n2. **LEFT to (5, 2)** - \u2705 SAFE! Empty space\n3. **RIGHT to (7, 2)** - \u2705 SAFE! Has an apple!\n4. **DOWN to (6, 1)** - \u2705 SAFE! Has an apple!\n\n**HOLD UP CHAT!** Both RIGHT and DOWN lead to apples! This is INSANE!\n\n**BUT WAIT...** Let me think about the enemy's next move. Enemy is at (2, 6) in the top-left. They could:\n- Go DOWN to (2, 5) or RIGHT to (3, 6)\n- Neither threatens me directly, but I need to think LONG-TERM\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nI need to consider which apple gives me better positioning. The apple at (7, 2) is isolated, but (6, 1) connects to (6, 0) below it. \n\n**REMEMBER MY STRATEGY:** I said I was building a wall on the right side and controlling the board! The apple at (7, 2) pushes me further right, maintaining my territory control. Plus, (7, 2) is EXACTLY where the enemy might try to come if they break out - I need to claim that area!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat at (7, 2), then I'll have apples at (7, 6), (7, 9), (9, 4) and (6, 1), (6, 0) nearby. I'll be positioned to dominate the right side while boxing enemy in top-left. The apple at (6, 1) can wait - I'll circle back for it after securing (7, 2) and threatening the enemy's escape routes!\n\n**CHAAAAAT! RIGHT TO (7, 2) IS THE PLAY!** This gives me the apple AND keeps me positioned to control the right half of the board! Enemy stays in their corner while I expand my empire! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

Looking at row 3: `.` `.` `.` `.` `T` `T` `T` `.` `.` `.` - (7, 3) is empty (the `T`s are at 4,5,6).

DEAD. \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 2):** Check row 2: `A` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `1` `.` `.` - (8, 2) is empty. Safe move.\n\n**ELIMINATED:** LEFT is instant death into my own body. \n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\n\nSnake #0 at (2, 5) is still in the top-left. If they move RIGHT to (3, 5), they're still far from me. If they move DOWN to (2, 4), they're getting closer but still 5+ spaces away.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLANNING:**\n\nI need to maintain pressure on the right side. From (7, 2), I have apples at (7, 6), (7, 9), and (9, 4) that I can work toward. \n\n**THE PLAY:** I should move **UP to (7, 3)**. Why? Because:\n1. It opens up paths to both (7, 6) and (9, 4) apples\n2. I avoid the bottom-right corner where I might get trapped\n3. It keeps my body in a line, preserving future flexibility\n4. Moving UP keeps me on the right side, boxing Snake #0 into their corner\n\n**ENEMY ANTICIPATION:** Snake #0 is likely to chase an apple. Looking at apples around them: (3, 7), (4, 6), (3, 1), (4, 1) - they might go for (3, 7) or (4, 6). Either way, they're not close enough to threaten a head-on collision yet. \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** Moving UP is safe, opens options, and keeps me positioned to dominate. The other options are also safe but UP feels most strategic for board control.\n\n**CHAT! UP to (7, 3) IS THE PLAY!** Let's keep the pressure on! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

I need to get aggressive and force an advantage. Where are the apples?\n- (7, 6) - Right above me if I go UP\n- (7, 9) - Far top-right corner\n- (9, 4) - Far right\n- (4, 6) - Mid-left, but Snake #0 might be closer\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 4), I'm heading toward (7, 6) and (7, 9). That's a good path to grow.\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 3), I'm heading toward (9, 4) and the right edge. Also good.\n\n**ENEMY ANTICIPATION:**\nSnake #0 is at (1, 5). Apples near them: (3, 7), (4, 6). They might go UP to (1, 6) or RIGHT to (2, 5) but (2, 5) is their own body! Wait, (2, 5) is body segment. So RIGHT is blocked for them. They can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but LEFT is off board). So UP to (1, 6) or DOWN to (1, 4) are their likely moves.\n\nIf they go UP, they're moving toward (3, 7) and (4, 6). If they go DOWN, they're moving toward (3, 1) and (4, 1).\n\nEither way, they're not close to me. I need to grow and dominate the right side.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nI will move UP toward the apples at (7, 6) and (7, 9). From there, I can sweep the right side and cut off Snake #0's access to the center. I need to get to 6 apples to tie, then 7 to lead. Aggression is key - I'll force a collision once I'm ahead.\n\n**THE PLAY:** Move **UP to (7, 4)**. Why?\n1. Opens path to (7, 6) apple - just two moves away!\n2. Keeps me out of the bottom-right corner where I might get trapped.\n3. Maintains body flexibility for future turns.\n4.

Safe move. \u2705\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 4):** Row 4: `.` `0` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `1` `.` `A` - (8, 4) is empty. Safe move. \u2705\n\n**ELIMINATED:** DOWN is instant death into my own body.\n\n**ENEMY ANTICIPATION & STRATEGY:**\nSnake #0 is at (1, 4) with head at (1, 4) and body trailing up. They have 6 apples. They can go UP to (1, 5) - but (1, 5) is their own body! Wait, looking at the board state: \"Snake #0 - Head: (1, 4), Body: [(1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8)]\". So (1, 5) IS their body! So UP is blocked for them. They can go DOWN to (1, 3), LEFT to (0, 4) (off board? x=0 is valid, left would be x=-1 which is off), or RIGHT to (2, 4). RIGHT to (2, 4) is empty. So they likely go RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf they go RIGHT, they move toward the center. If they go DOWN, they go toward apples at (3, 1) or (4, 1). Either way, they're not threatening me directly yet.\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (7, 5):** This moves me toward the apple at (7, 6) and then (7, 9). It also positions me vertically aligned with Snake #0's potential path if they go right.\n2. **LEFT to (6, 4):** This moves me toward the apple at (4, 6) and also cuts off potential access to the left side. I can then go UP or DOWN from there.\n3. **RIGHT to (8, 4):** This moves me toward the apple at (9, 4) and the edge. It's safe but might trap me against the right wall later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nI need to grow FAST. Snake #0 has a head start. I see a cluster of apples on the left side: (4, 6), (3, 7), (6, 7). If I move LEFT now to (6, 4), I can start sweeping that cluster. Moving UP to (7, 5) is also good, but (7, 6) is only 2 moves away from my current head. However, (7, 6) is not the only apple. (6, 7) is also valuable and Snake #0 might go for it if I don't.\n\nBut wait! Look at the board: Snake #0's body blocks a lot of the left side. If I move LEFT to (6, 4), I can potentially trap them in the left corner if they're not careful. I want to control the board center and deny them apples.\n\nActually, let's look at the apple list again: (7, 6) is right above where I'd be if I go UP. (6, 7) is left and up from (6, 4). Both are viable. \n\n**DECISION:**\nI will move **LEFT to (6, 4)**. Why?\n1. It moves me toward the apple cluster at (4, 6) and (6, 7), which Snake #0 might also target. I need to get there first.\n2. From (6, 4), I have more flexible options next turn: I can go UP to (6, 5), DOWN to (6, 3) (but that might be my body? Wait, my body is at (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3). So (6, 3) IS my body! So from (6, 4), DOWN to (6, 3) is DEATH. LEFT to (5, 4) is empty. RIGHT to (7, 4) would be backtracking into my own body? No, (7, 4) is where I am now, but the tail moves. Actually, after I move, my tail moves. So (7, 4) might be empty. UP to (6, 5) is empty. So from (6, 4), I have UP and LEFT and possibly RIGHT (if my tail moves).\n3. It cuts off Snake #0's potential expansion to the right. They are on the left side (x=1). If I claim x=6, I control the right half.\n\nActually, let's double-check the body positions after move. If I move LEFT to (6, 4), my new body will be [(7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2)]. So (7, 4) becomes my new neck, and (6, 3) becomes free. So from (6, 4), I can go DOWN to (6, 3) safely next turn! That's a crucial insight. So LEFT gives me DOWN option later.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\n- UP to (7, 5): From there, DOWN to (7, 4) (back), LEFT to (6, 5), RIGHT to (8, 5). All safe. Good for going up toward (7, 6).\n- LEFT to (6, 4): From there, UP to (6, 5), DOWN to (6, 3), LEFT to (5, 4). Also good, and I can chase (4, 6).\n\nI want to be aggressive and box Snake #0 in. They are at x=1. If I go LEFT toward x=4-6, I can meet them in the middle and potentially trap them against their own body or the edge. The apple at (4, 6) is directly in their path if they go right/up. I need to get it first.\n\n**FINAL CALL:** Move LEFT to (6, 4). It positions me to grab the left-center apples and challenge Snake #0's expansion. Let's go!\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 thinks they're safe? Nah, we're boxing them in! Let's break this down.**  \n\n**MY CURRENT STATE (Head at (7, 4), Body: [(7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3)]):**  \n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM (7, 4):**  \n\n**UP to (7, 5):** Row 5: `.` `T` `T` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` - (7, 5) is empty. Safe move. \u2705  \n\n**DOWN to (7, 3):** That's my own body! DEAD. \u274c  \n\n**LEFT to (6, 4):** Row 4: `.` `0` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `1` `.` `A` - (6, 4) is empty. Safe move. \u2705  \n\n**RIGHT to (8, 4):** Row 4: `.` `0` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `1` `.` `A` - (8, 4) is empty. Safe move. \u2705  \n\n**ELIMINATED:** DOWN is instant death into my own body.  \n\n**ENEMY ANTICIPATION & STRATEGY:**  \nSnake #0 is at (1, 4) with head at (1, 4) and body trailing up. They have 6 apples. They can go UP to (1, 5) - but (1, 5) is their own body! Wait, looking at the board state: \"Snake #0 - Head: (1, 4), Body: [(1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8)]\". So (1, 5) IS their body! So UP is blocked for them. They can go DOWN to (1, 3), LEFT to (0, 4) (off board? x=0 is valid, left would be x=-1 which is off), or RIGHT to (2, 4). RIGHT to (2, 4) is empty. So they likely go RIGHT or DOWN.  \n\nIf they go RIGHT, they move toward the center. If they go DOWN, they go toward apples at (3, 1) or (4, 1). Either way, they're not threatening me directly yet.  \n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS:**  \n1. **UP to (7, 5):** This moves me toward the apple at (7, 6) and then (7, 9). It also positions me vertically aligned with Snake #0's potential path if they go right.  \n2. **LEFT to (6, 4):** This moves me toward the apple at (4, 6) and also cuts off potential access to the left side. I can then go UP or DOWN from there.  \n3. **RIGHT to (8, 4):** This moves me toward the apple at (9, 4) and the edge. It's safe but might trap me against the right wall later.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nI need to grow FAST. Snake #0 has a head start. I see a cluster of apples on the left side: (4, 6), (3, 7), (6, 7). If I move LEFT now to (6, 4), I can start sweeping that cluster. Moving UP to (7, 5) is also good, but (7, 6) is only 2 moves away from my current head. However, (7, 6) is not the only apple. (6, 7) is also valuable and Snake #0 might go for it if I don't.  \n\nBut wait! Look at the board: Snake #0's body blocks a lot of the left side. If I move LEFT to (6, 4), I can potentially trap them in the left corner if they're not careful. I want to control the board center and deny them apples.  \n\nActually, let's look at the apple list again: (7, 6) is right above where I'd be if I go UP. (6, 7) is left and up from (6, 4). Both are viable.  \n\n**DECISION:**  \nI will move **LEFT to (6, 4)**. Why?  \n1. It moves me toward the apple cluster at (4, 6) and (6, 7), which Snake #0 might also target. I need to get there first.  \n2. From (6, 4), I have more flexible options next turn: I can go UP to (6, 5), DOWN to (6, 3) (but that might be my body? Wait, my body is at (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3). So (6, 3) IS my body! So from (6, 4), DOWN to (6, 3) is DEATH. LEFT to (5, 4) is empty. RIGHT to (7, 4) would be backtracking into my own body? No, (7, 4) is where I am now, but the tail moves. Actually, after I move, my tail moves. So (7, 4) might be empty. UP to (6, 5) is empty. So from (6, 4), I have UP and LEFT and possibly RIGHT (if my tail moves).  \n3. It cuts off Snake #0's potential expansion to the right. They are on the left side (x=1). If I claim x=6, I control the right half.  \n\nActually, let's double-check the body positions after move. If I move LEFT to (6, 4), my new body will be [(7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2)]. So (7, 4) becomes my new neck, and (6, 3) becomes free. So from (6, 4), I can go DOWN to (6, 3) safely next turn! That's a crucial insight. So LEFT gives me DOWN option later.  \n\n**COMPARISON:**  \n- UP to (7, 5): From there, DOWN to (7, 4) (back), LEFT to (6, 5), RIGHT to (8, 5). All safe. Good for going up toward (7, 6).  \n- LEFT to (6, 4): From there, UP to (6, 5), DOWN to (6, 3), LEFT to (5, 4). Also good, and I can chase (4, 6).  \n\nI want to be aggressive and box Snake #0 in. They are at x=1. If I go LEFT toward x=4-6, I can meet them in the middle and potentially trap them against their own body or the edge. The apple at (4, 6) is directly in their path if they go right/up. I need to get it first.  \n\n**FINAL CALL:** Move LEFT to (6, 4). It positions me to grab the left-center apples and challenge Snake #0's expansion. Let's go!  \n\nLEFT  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

This will force the rival to either move up/down in their x=6-7 ghetto or crash into their own body/our growing wall.

Let's break this down like a pro.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- My head: (4, 4) after that smooth LEFT move last turn.\n- My body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3)]\n- Enemy head: (3, 3)\n- Enemy body: [(2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)]\n\n**BOARD CHECK FROM (4, 4):**\n1. **UP to (4, 5):** Row 5 shows `.` `T` `T` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` - (4, 5) is EMPTY! Safe \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (4, 3):** Row 3 shows `.` `.` `T` `.` `.` `.` `.` `T` `.` `.` - (4, 3) is EMPTY! Safe \u2705  \n3. **LEFT to (3, 4):** Row 4 shows `.` `T` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `1` `.` `A` - Wait, (3, 4) is actually `.` (since row 4: index 0=`.` 1=`T` 2=`.` 3=`.` 4=`.`... Actually let me check properly: Row 4 = `. T . . . . . 1 . A` so positions: 0=`.`, 1=`T`, 2=`.`, 3=`.`, 4=`.`, 5=`.`, 6=`.`, 7=`1`, 8=`.`, 9=`A`. So (3,4) is actually EMPTY! Safe \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 4):** That's MY OWN BODY (5,4) is in my body list! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #0 at (3, 3) has options:\n- UP: (3, 4) - EMPTY (if we don't go there)\n- DOWN: (3, 2) - Row 2 shows `A . . . . . . T . .` so (3,2) is EMPTY\n- LEFT: (2, 3) - THAT'S THEIR OWN BODY! DEAD for them!\n- RIGHT: (4, 3) - EMPTY\n\nSo they're likely going DOWN or RIGHT toward apples at (3,1) or (4,3)/(4,1). They have 6 apples, they're getting cocky.\n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**\nI need to GROW and CUT THEM OFF! Looking at apples:\n- (4, 6) is 2 moves UP from me - VERY REACHABLE!\n- (7, 6) is far but available\n- (3, 7) is also reachable\n\nBut more importantly, Snake #0 is on the left side (x=3). If I move UP to (4, 5), I:\n1. Get closer to (4, 6) apple (2 moves away)\n2. Position myself to potentially BLOCK their expansion to the right\n3. Keep my options open (can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN next turn)\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 4), I risk a potential head-on collision if they go RIGHT to (4,3) and I go RIGHT next turn... wait no, I'm overthinking.\n\nActually, let's think about COLLISION RISKS:\n- If I go UP to (4,5) and they go RIGHT to (4,3): No collision (different rows)\n- If I go LEFT to (3,4) and they go UP to (3,4): HEAD-ON COLLISION! We both die! I can't risk that when I'm behind.\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP to (4, 5) is the SAFE and AGGRESSIVE play! I avoid head-on collision risk, get closer to the apple at (4,6), and keep my movement options flexible. I need to grow without dying - that's how we catch up!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nNext turn, if I'm at (4,5), I'll either:\n- Go UP to (4,6) for the apple (if safe)\n- Or go LEFT to (3,5) to cut off Snake #0's expansion path\nGotta play this smart and aggressive!\n\nUP",

This is a FREE GROW and +1 point to close the gap! SAFE \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (4,4):** That's MY OWN BODY (the tail is (7,4) but wait... my body is [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)] so (4,4) is the SECOND segment, NOT the tail!

I'm currently at 4 apples vs their 6. I NEED to catch up. \n- **LEFT or RIGHT** are positional moves but don't score. Plus, if I go LEFT to (3,5) and enemy goes UP to (3,5) \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! We both die! Since I'm behind in score, I win in a tie-breaker if we both die (4 vs 6 apples? No, if both die, the one with MORE apples wins... wait: \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn... snake with more apples wins.\" So if we both die, enemy wins 6-4. I CANNOT risk head-on collision when behind!**\n\n**CHOICE:** UP to (4,6) is the ONLY move that both:\n1. Scores a point (grows me toward catching up)\n2. Avoids all collision risks (enemy cannot reach (4,6) this turn)\n3. Opens up more options next turn (I'll be at (4,6) with apples around)\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter getting apple at (4,6), I'll likely have options to move toward (3,7) or (7,6) apples.

Turn 15, let's analyze the battlefield after that sweet apple at (4,6)!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Head:** (4, 6) - YES! We got that apple! Now at 5 apples vs their 6. We're close!\n- **My Body:** [(4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)] - Growing upward!\n- **Enemy Head:** (3, 5) - They went UP from (3,4). Now positioned at (3,5).\n- **Enemy Body:** [(3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)] - Still packed left side.\n\n**BOARD SNAPSHOT:**\nFrom the visual: \nRow 6: `. . . . 1 . . A . .` \u2192 I'm at (4,6), apple at (7,6) (but that's a bit far).\nRow 5: `. T . 0 T . . . . .` \u2192 Enemy at (3,5), but there's a \"T\" at (2,5)? Wait, looking at enemy body, (2,5) isn't listed... actually enemy body ends at (1,5). So (2,5) is likely EMPTY or an apple? The board shows `T` at (2,5) which might be from previous turn's tail? Actually enemy tail is (1,5) based on their body list. Let's trust the body list.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (4,6):**\n1. **UP to (4,7):** Row 7 shows `. . . A . . A . . .` \u2192 (4,7) is EMPTY! SAFE \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (4,5):** That's MY OWN BODY (head was (4,5) last turn, now it's the first body segment). DEAD! \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (3,6):** Row 6 shows `. . . . 1 . . A . .` \u2192 (3,6) is EMPTY! SAFE \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (5,6):** Row 6 shows `. . . . 1 . . A . .` \u2192 (5,6) is EMPTY! SAFE \u2705\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (3,5) has options:\n- UP: (3,6) - EMPTY\n- DOWN: (3,4) - THEIR OWN BODY (the segment behind head)! DEAD!\n- LEFT: (2,5) - EMPTY (based on body list, not an apple)\n- RIGHT: (4,5) - MY BODY (segment behind my head)! DEAD!\n\nThey can ONLY go UP or LEFT. They'll likely go UP toward (3,6) or (3,7) where there's an apple at (3,7)!\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI have THREE safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- **UP to (4,7):** Moves toward apple at (3,7) or (7,6). Opens up options. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (3,6):** Moves into the space enemy might want (if they go UP). If enemy goes UP to (3,6), we'd have HEAD-ON COLLISION! Since I'm still behind in score (5 vs 6), I lose in a tie-breaker if we both die. CANNOT risk this!\n- **RIGHT to (5,6):** Moves toward apple at (7,6). Also safe, no immediate collision risk.\n\n**CHOICE:** I'll go **UP** to (4,7). Why?\n1. Avoids potential head-on collision at (3,6) with enemy.\n2. Positions me nicely for either going LEFT to (3,7) apple next turn, or RIGHT to (7,6) apple.\n3. Keeps me in the center of the board, maintaining board control.\n4. Enemy likely going UP to (3,6) or LEFT to (2,5), neither threatens me immediately.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter reaching (4,7), I want to cut off Snake #0's access to the right side apples. If they go UP to (3,6), I can potentially go LEFT to (3,7) to eat that apple and block their path. Need to keep growing while forcing them into a corner. If I can get to 6 apples, I can start aggressive hunting!\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Why box ourselves in when we have better options? \ud83e\udd2f We\u2019d be handing the enemy a chance to squeeze us\u2014no thanks!\n- UP (3,6): Open terrain! Moves us toward a reachable apple at (3,7) (free score boost to 7-5 incoming!) and gives multiple follow-up options (up to apple, left to (2,6), right if enemy moves away). No tight spots\u2014perfect for dominating the board!\n\nRhetorical question blast: Why pick a trap when UP keeps us open, moves us toward an apple, and keeps pressure on the enemy? \ud83e\udd2f Why risk limiting our future moves for a dead-end left? Exactly\u2014we don\u2019t!\n\nLong-term strategy note for future me (listen up \ud83d\udc42): After moving UP to (3,6) this turn, next turn prioritize checking if moving UP to (3,7) (apple!) is safe\u2014snag that to boost our lead to 7-5. If enemy\u2019s head moves left to (3,6), they crash into our new head (instant win!). Also, monitor enemy\u2019s long tail along y=4\u2014they\u2019re at risk of boxing themselves in, so keep extending upward to cut off their left escape routes and grow your body to dominate the board.\n\nUP",

I'm one behind!\n- My body: [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)]\n- Enemy head: (3,6) - They went UP from (3,5) last turn!\n- Enemy body: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4)]\n\n**Board State Check:**\nFrom the visual:\nRow 7: `. . . A 1 . A . . .` \u2192 I'm at (4,7)\nRow 6: `. . . 0 T . . A . .` \u2192 Enemy at (3,6), tail at (2,6)? Wait, enemy body shows (3,5)... but visual says T at (2,6)? Actually, enemy head moved to (3,6), so their old tail might have moved. Let's trust the body list: they're at (3,6) with body extending down to (1,4). The T at (2,6) might be outdated or visual glitch. I'll trust the provided body list.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (4,7):**\n1. **UP to (4,8):** Row 8 is all dots. SAFE \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (4,6):** That's MY BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (3,7):** Row 7 shows `(3,7)` is an APPLE! \"A\" at (3,7) in the apple list. SAFE \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (5,7):** Row 7 shows `(5,7)` is EMPTY. SAFE \u2705\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS (Snake #0 at (3,6)):**\nTheir options:\n- UP: (3,7) - That's an APPLE! (Apple list shows (3,7))\n- DOWN: (3,5) - THEIR BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n- LEFT: (2,6) - Empty? Visual shows T, but might be empty now. Probably SAFE.\n- RIGHT: (4,6) - MY BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n\nSo enemy can ONLY go UP or LEFT. They likely go UP to (3,7) for the apple!\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nIf I go LEFT to (3,7), I'll grab that apple and grow to 6 apples! BUT if enemy also goes UP to (3,7), we'll have HEAD-ON COLLISION at (3,7) and BOTH die! Since I'm behind in score (5 vs 6), if we both die, they win. That's a risk.\n\nIf I go UP to (4,8): Safe, no immediate apple, but keeps options open.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,7): Safe, moves toward apple at (7,6) and (7,9).\n\n**MY MOVE: UP to (4,8)**\nWhy?\n1. **SAFETY FIRST:** No risk of head-on collision. If enemy goes UP to (3,7), we're not in the same cell.\n2. **POSITIONING:** I get to row 8, opening up left side and staying central. From (4,8), next turn I can go LEFT to (3,8) or RIGHT to (5,8), keeping flexibility.\n3. **APPLE PLANNING:** The apple at (3,7) is tempting, but if I go LEFT now, I risk dying. Better to wait and see if enemy takes it. If they do, they grow to 7 apples, but I stay alive. If they don't (maybe they go LEFT), I can grab it next turn from (4,8) -> (3,8) -> (3,7) or directly from (4,8) to (3,8) to (3,7).\n4. **BOARD CONTROL:** Staying higher gives me better control over the top half of the board where there are more apples (7,6), (7,9), (9,4), etc.).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving UP, I'll be at (4,8). Next turn, assess enemy's move. If they went UP to (3,7), I might go LEFT to (3,8) to position for the apple at (3,7) next time OR go RIGHT toward (7,6) apple. I want to grow to 6 apples quickly to match their score, then go for aggressive boxing. I need to trap them in the left-bottom corner. From (4,8), I can start moving right to cut off their escape. Stay alive, stay patient, wait for the right moment to strike! \ud83d\udc80\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Safe \u2705 PLUS (3,7) IS AN APPLE\u2014hello free point to make it 7-5!\n- DOWN: (3,6) \u2192 (3,5). THAT\u2019S OUR OWN BODY SEGMENT (first in our body list!) and backwards into the previous head spot\u2014self-crash rookie fail! Hard no \u274c Cross that off forever!\n- LEFT: (3,6) \u2192 (2,6). Technically not a self/enemy crash\u2026 but wait for follow-ups\u2014we\u2019ll eviscerate this later \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- RIGHT: (3,6) \u2192 (4,6). THAT\u2019S ENEMY SNAKE 1\u2019S BODY SEGMENT (their first body part!)\u2014crashing into enemy body is instant loss! Hard no \u274c Ax that!\n\nNow, let\u2019s rank the safe moves (UP vs. LEFT) with our win goals in mind:\n- LEFT (2,6): Follow-up moves are limited\u2014no apple to boost our lead, pulls us away from Snake 1\u2019s head (4,7) (letting them escape pressure), and gives us zero immediate scoring upside. Why give them a break when we can crush their momentum? \ud83e\udd2f Dead-end move\u2014hard pass \u274c\n- UP (3,7): Open terrain! Moves us straight to an apple (free 7-5 lead), keeps multiple follow-up options (up to (3,8), left to (2,7)) to keep boxing Snake 1 in, and cuts off their left escape route (their head is at (4,7)\u2014if they try to move left, they crash into our new head!). Perfect for dominating the board and applying unrelenting pressure \u2705\n\nRhetorical question blast: Why pick a dead-end left when UP gives us a free point, boxes Snake 1 in, and keeps our future moves open? Why risk letting Snake 1 catch up in score when we can widen our lead instantly? Exactly\u2014we don\u2019t!\n\nLong-term strategy note for future me (listen up \ud83d\udc42): After moving UP to (3,7) (apple, 7-5 score), next turn prioritize checking if moving UP to (3,8) is safe to keep extending pressure\u2014this will box Snake 1 further into the right side of the board. If Snake 1\u2019s head moves left to (3,7) (our new head), they crash instantly (win!). Also, monitor their long tail at y=4\u2014they\u2019re at risk of getting tangled in their own tail, so keep growing upward to dominate the top board and cut off all their escape routes. Don\u2019t forget our body is growing, so avoid self-crashes by checking our extended body next turn.\n\nUP",

We're LIVE at Turn 17 with a score gap! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\nLet's analyze the situation.\n\n**Current State:**\n- **Me (Snake #1):** Head at `(4, 8)`, Body: `[(4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)]` | Apples: **5** (Behind by 2)\n- **Enemy (Snake #0):** Head at `(3, 7)`, Body: `[(3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4)]` | Apples: **7**\n\n**Board & Threat Assessment:**\nI am currently sitting at `(4, 8)`.\n- **UP to (4, 9):** That's the top edge. Wall collision. **DEATH.**\n- **LEFT to (3, 8):** Currently empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (4, 7):** That's my own neck/body. **DEATH.**\n- **RIGHT to (5, 8):** Currently empty. Safe.\n\nWait! Let's re-check the visual board.\nRow 8: `. . . . 1 . . . . .` (I am at 4,8).\nRow 7: `. . . 0 T . A . . .` (Enemy at 3,7. Apple at 5,7).\nRow 6: `. . . T T . . A . .`\n\n**Wait a second...** Let's look at the Apple Drops list provided at the start.\nApples include: `(1, 1), (9, 0), (7, 6), (4, 1), (7, 9), (6, 1), (6, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), (6, 7), (9, 4), (3, 1), (0, 1), (1, 3), (7, 3)`\n**I do not see `(5, 7)` in the apple list.**\nThe visual board shows `A` at `(5, 7)` in Row 7.\n*Is the visual board accurate or is the apple list accurate?*\nUsually, the apple list is the source of truth. The visual board might be outdated or showing a phantom apple. If I trust the apple list, `(5, 7)` is just empty space.\nHowever, looking at Row 4 in the visual board: `. T T T T T . . . A`\nThe body at `(5, 4)` is mine (I'm Snake 1). But visually there is a `T` at `(2,6)`.\nThe Enemy Body list is: `[(3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4)]`.\nWait, the Enemy Body list has 7 segments. The Enemy Head is at `(3, 7)`.\nSo their body starts at `(3, 6)`.\nThe visual board shows `T` at `(2, 6)`. This conflicts with the body list.\n**TRUST THE DATA LISTS OVER THE VISUAL GRID.**\nThe Enemy Body list does *not* include `(2, 6)`.\nTherefore, `(2, 6)` is likely empty.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy is at `(3, 7)`. They just moved there (last turn they were at `(3, 6)`).\nPossible moves for Enemy:\n- **UP:** `(3, 8)` - Empty.\n- **DOWN:** `(3, 6)` - This is their own body (neck). **DEATH.**\n- **LEFT:** `(2, 7)` - Empty (Visual shows `.`, Body list doesn't cover it).\n- **RIGHT:** `(4, 7)` - This is **MY BODY**. If they go here, **THEY DIE**.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n1.  **Option 1: LEFT to (3, 8)**\n    -   **Risk:** If Enemy goes UP to `(3, 8)`, we collide head-on. I have 5 apples, they have 7. I lose the tie-breaker. I die.\n    -   **Reward:** I get closer to the left side. Potentially trap them? No apple here.\n\n2.  **Option 2: RIGHT to (5, 8)**\n    -   **Risk:** None immediate. (5, 8) is empty.\n    -   **Reward:** I move toward the right side. If the visual `A` at `(5, 7)` is real, I'm one step away. If not, I'm central.\n    -   **Enemy Interaction:** If Enemy goes RIGHT into my body `(4, 7)`, **THEY DIE**. I win instantly.\n    -   **Safety:** If Enemy goes UP or LEFT, I am safe at `(5, 8)`.\n\n**The Trap Setup:**\nIf I move **RIGHT to (5, 8)**, I leave my body at `(4, 7)` exposed as bait.\nEnemy is at `(3, 7)`. They are cramped.\n- If they go **UP**: They live, but I gain right-side positioning.\n- If they go **LEFT**: They live, but I flank them.\n- If they go **RIGHT**: They hit my body. **I WIN.**\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (3, 8)**, I risk a head-on collision where I lose because I have fewer apples. That's a bad gamble.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (5, 8)**, I force the enemy to make a move. My body at `(4, 7)` acts as a wall to their right. Their only safe moves are UP or LEFT. Moving RIGHT kills them.\n\n**Aggressive Play:**\nI am behind in score (5 vs 7). I need to force errors.\nBy going RIGHT, I also open up the path to `(6, 8)` -> `(7, 8)` -> `(7, 6)` (Apple) or `(7, 9)` (Apple).\nAlso, if I go RIGHT, next turn I could potentially move DOWN to `(5, 7)` (if the apple is there) or LEFT to `(4, 8)` (loop back).\n\n**Final Decision:**\nMove **RIGHT**. It is safe, expands my territory, and positions me to punish the enemy if they try to invade my space. I am putting the pressure on them.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (5, 8). If the enemy moves right into my body, game over, we win. If not, I maintain flexibility to chase apples on the right or pivot left.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is at `(3, 8)` with a body length of 8. We are currently on parallel tracks on row 8, separated by one tile at `(4, 8)` (which is currently empty).\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **Row 9 (Top):** Blocked.\n- **Row 8:** `. . . 0 ? 1 . . . .` (Wait, looking at the data, Enemy is at `(3, 8)` and I am at `(5, 8)`. There is a gap at `(4, 8)`.\n- **Row 7:** `. . . T T . A . . .` (Enemy body at `(3, 7)` and `(4, 7)`. Apple at `(5, 7)`).\n- **Row 6:** `. . . T T . . A . .`\n- **Row 5:** `. . . T T . . . . .`\n\n**THE DANGER ZONE:**\nThe enemy is at `(3, 8)`. Their possible moves:\n- **UP:** `(3, 9)` -> **DEATH** (Wall).\n- **DOWN:** `(3, 7)` -> **DEATH** (Their own body).\n- **LEFT:** `(2, 8)` -> Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** `(4, 8)` -> Safe (Empty space).\n\nIf they move **RIGHT to `(4, 8)`**, they will be right next to me at `(5, 8)`. This sets up a potential head-on collision next turn if I don't move carefully.\n\n**MY OPTIONS:**\n1.  **UP to `(5, 9)`:** **DEATH** (Wall).\n2.  **DOWN to `(5, 7)`:** **APPLE!** (Visual confirms, and it's in the apple list). This puts my head at `(5, 7)`.\n    -   *Risk:* If the Enemy moves **RIGHT to `(4, 8)`** and then next turn moves **DOWN to `(4, 7)`**, we are safe. But wait, if I move DOWN to `(5, 7)` and they move RIGHT to `(4, 8)`, the distance between heads is 1 tile `(4, 8)` vs `(5, 7)`. We are diagonal.\n    -   *Aggression:* Eating the apple at `(5, 7)` increases my score to 6. I'm still behind (6 vs 7), but closing the gap. More importantly, moving DOWN blocks the enemy from going there. If they try to go RIGHT to `(4, 8)` and then DOWN to `(4, 7)` (which is their body) or `(5, 7)` (which is now me), they crash.\n3.  **LEFT to `(4, 8)`:**\n    -   This puts me directly next to the enemy head at `(3, 8)`.\n    -   If they stay still or move RIGHT, we collide.\n    -   If they move UP or DOWN, they die (wall/body). If they move LEFT, we are adjacent.\n    -   This is risky. A head-on collision here (if they also move LEFT or I move LEFT into them) favors them (7 apples vs 5). I should avoid direct confrontation while I'm losing on points.\n4.  **RIGHT to `(6, 8)`:**\n    -   Safe empty space.\n    -   Moves me away from the enemy.\n    -   But I miss the apple at `(5, 7)`.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am losing. I need apples. The apple at `(5, 7)` is directly below me. It is safe to take because:\n1.  The enemy *cannot* go DOWN (it's their body).\n2.  The enemy *cannot* go UP (wall).\n3.  The enemy's only safe moves are LEFT `(2, 8)` or RIGHT `(4, 8)`.\n    -   If they go LEFT, I eat the apple and we are safe.\n    -   If they go RIGHT to `(4, 8)`, they are adjacent to me at `(5, 7)` (diagonal). This is a standoff position. I can then plan my next move (likely LEFT or DOWN to loop).\n    -   *Crucially*, by taking the apple, I deny them the spot and grow my length. If I grow, my tail won't move next turn, potentially blocking a path for them if they chase me down.\n\nI must close the score gap. Taking the apple is the only way to stay in the game. Moving away (RIGHT) leaves me scoreless and lets the enemy keep their lead. Moving LEFT risks a collision where I lose on points. Moving DOWN secures the point and keeps me alive.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nEat the apple to close the gap to 6-7. The enemy is trapped in the top-left corner (limited moves). By moving DOWN, I force them to either retreat left or commit to the right side where I have a body anchor. I need to loop around and eventually trap them against the wall. Don't let them breathe.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nDOWN to eat the apple and gain ground.\n\nDOWN",

THAT\u2019S ENEMY SNAKE 1\u2019S BODY SEGMENT (their first body part!)\u2014crashing into enemy body is instant loss! Hard no \u274c Ax that!\n\nNow, rank the safe moves (UP vs. LEFT) with our win-at-all-costs goals in mind\u2014let\u2019s blast the rhetorical questions:\nDo we want to pull away from Snake 1 (left) or keep applying upper pressure (up)? Do we want to chase future apples (up to (3,9) near the (7,9) apple) or take a dead-end left that gives Snake 1 more room to breathe? Do we want to keep our 7-5 lead and box them in tighter or let them escape? Exactly\u2014no mercy!\n\nLet\u2019s break the safe moves down:\n- LEFT (2,8): Open terrain, but pulls us away from Snake 1\u2019s head (5,8) (letting them escape pressure) and gives us zero immediate scoring upside. Why give them a break when we can crush their momentum? \ud83e\udd2f Dead-end move\u2014hard pass \u274c\n- UP (3,9): Open terrain! Moves us straight into upper board territory to cut off Snake 1\u2019s higher left escape route (if they try to move up to (5,9), we\u2019re already holding down the left upper zone). Keeps multiple follow-up options (up to (3,9) we could go left to (2,9) next turn) to keep boxing them in, and stays in the upper board where we can target the (7,9) apple to extend our lead to 8-5. Why pick a dead-end left when UP keeps us on the attack? \ud83e\udd2f\n\nLong-term strategy note for future me (listen up \ud83d\udc42): After moving UP to (3,9), next turn prioritize checking if moving LEFT to (2,9) is safe to box Snake 1 in even tighter\u2014their head is (5,8), so if they move up to (5,9), we can cut off their left escape route with (2,9) and (3,9). Also, keep an eye on the apple at (7,9) as a future grab to extend our lead. Remember our body will shift (tail moves since we didn\u2019t eat an apple this turn), so don\u2019t move down into our old head spot (3,8) next turn\u2014it\u2019ll be our body. Keep the pressure high, force Snake 1 to choose between crashing into their own body (they can\u2019t move down far\u2014their body is (4,7), (4,6), etc.) or moving right where we can cut them off.\n\nUP",

Score is now 6 to 7\u2014I'm closing in!\n\nLet's look at the grid from my new position **(5,7)**. The enemy is at **(3,9)**, but wait... looking at the board state provided by the system, the enemy head is actually at **(3,9)**? No, let's re-read the provided board state at the start of the prompt.\n\n**BOARD STATE (Turn 19):**\nRow 9: `. . . 0 . . . A . .`\nRow 8: `. . . T T T . . . .` (This matches my last turn's move DOWN to (5,7)? Wait. The \"T\" at (5,8) is my old body. The \"T\" at (4,8) and (3,8) etc is enemy body.)\nRow 7: `. . . T T 1 A . . .`\n\nOkay, let's map this carefully.\nMy head is at **(5,7)**.\nMy body: `[(5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)]`.\nWait. My body includes (5,8) and (4,8) and (4,7). So the cells (5,8), (4,8), (4,7) are filled by me.\n\nThe Enemy Head is at **(3,9)** according to the \"OPPONENTS\" section. But the board shows `0` at (3,9) on Row 9? No, Row 9 shows `. . . 0 . . . A . .`. Let's check coordinates.\nRow 9 is y=9.\n`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`\n`. . . 0 . . . A . .`\nSo (3,9) is indeed the Enemy Head. Good.\n\n**THE DANGER ZONE:**\nEnemy at **(3,9)**.\nEnemy Body: `[(3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3)]`.\nNote: The enemy body listed stops at (2,3). The board shows `(3,4), (3,5)` etc.\nThe board shows `T` at (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4).\nWait, the board shows `T T T` at (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)?\nLet's look at Row 8 again: `. . . T T T . . . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(3,8) = T (Enemy Body)\n(4,8) = T (My Body)\n(5,8) = T (My Body)\nSo my body is occupying (5,8) and (4,8) and (4,7).\nEnemy body is occupying (3,8), (3,7), etc.\n\nThe Enemy at (3,9) is trapped!\nMoves:\n- **UP:** (3,10) -> **DEATH** (Wall).\n- **LEFT:** (2,9) -> Safe? The board shows (2,9) as empty on Row 9.\n- **RIGHT:** (4,9) -> (4,9) is empty on Row 9.\n- **DOWN:** (3,8) -> **DEATH** (Enemy Body).\n\nThe Enemy will likely move LEFT or RIGHT. They are forced to move out of the corner.\n\n**MY OPTIONS (Head at 5,7):**\n1.  **UP to (5,8):** **DEATH** (My Body).\n2.  **LEFT to (4,7):** **DEATH** (My Body).\n3.  **DOWN to (5,6):**\n    -   Let's check the board: Row 6 is `. . . T T . . A . .`\n    -   (5,6) is empty? Yes, it's a dot.\n    -   This is safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6,7):**\n    -   Row 7: `. . . T T 1 A . . .`\n    -   (6,7) is empty? Yes.\n    -   This is safe.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nI am cornered! My head is at (5,7) and my body blocks UP (5,8) and LEFT (4,7).\nMy tail is at (4,5). As I move, my tail will shift forward.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (5,6)**:\n-   My new head: (5,6).\n-   My new body: [(5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6)].\n-   *Wait*, my body list is `[(5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)]`. The head is (5,7).\n-   If I move DOWN, the new head is (5,6).\n-   The tail (4,5) moves to (4,6).\n-   The new body list: Head (5,6) -> (5,7) -> (5,8) -> (4,8) -> (4,7) -> (4,6).\n-   This creates a solid block on the left side.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (6,7)**:\n-   My new head: (6,7).\n-   My new body: [(6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (4,7)].\n-   This opens up the right side. There is an apple at (6,7)? No, the apple list shows (6,7) is an apple? Let's check the apple list.\n-   Apple list: `(1, 1), (9, 0), (7, 6), (4, 1), (7, 9), (6, 1), (6, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), (6, 7), (9, 4), (3, 1), (0, 1), (1, 3), (7, 3)`\n-   YES! **(6,7)** is an apple!\n-   If I eat it, my score becomes 7. This ties the score 7-7!\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe Enemy is trapped at (3,9). They have to move LEFT or RIGHT.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (6,7):\n-   I eat the apple (Score 7-7).\n-   I am safe.\n-   I open up movement to the right side of the board.\n-   The Enemy will likely move RIGHT to (4,9) to escape the corner.\n-   This puts us on a collision course for the center/right side.\n-   Moving RIGHT gives me more space and options than moving DOWN into the left-side choke point where my body is already clustered.\n\n**DECISION:**\nEat the apple at (6,7) to tie the score and gain board control.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Remember our tail will shift (no apple eaten this turn) so don\u2019t fixate on old tail spots.

I need to close the distance.\n**UP (6, 8)** moves me closer to the top edge where the enemy is heading. It opens up the right side (7,8, 8,8, etc) for the chase.\n**DOWN (6, 6)** moves me away from the enemy. Bad idea.\n**RIGHT (7, 7)** is okay, but **UP** cuts the angle better to intercept in the top-right quadrant.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Turn 20:** Move **UP** to (6, 8). Enemy moves to (5, 9).\n2.  **Turn 21:** Enemy moves to (6, 9). I move **RIGHT** to (7, 8).\n3.  **Turn 22:** Enemy at (6, 9) is trapped.\n    *   Enemy Right (7, 9) -> Safe?\n    *   Enemy Down (6, 8) -> Blocked by me if I was at (7,8)?

Draw?\n        *   *Correction:* If all die, the one with MORE apples wins. Enemy has 7, I have 6. Enemy wins the tie-breaker.\n        *   **I NEED TO GET AN APPLE FIRST.**\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:**\nThere is an apple at **(7, 9)**.\nIf I can get that apple, I tie the score (7-7).\nIf I tie the score and then we collide, it's a draw. But I need to WIN.\nWait, if I get the apple at (7,9), my score becomes 7.\nIf I block the enemy at (7,9) or kill them...\nActually, the apple at (7,9) is in the top right corner.\nIf I go UP to (6,8) now, I am positioned to grab apples in the top area.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE: RIGHT to (7, 7).**\nThis puts me closer to (7,9) than UP does.\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7):\n*   Enemy to (5,9).\n*   Next turn (T21): Enemy to (6,9). I go RIGHT to (8,7).\n*   T22: Enemy to (7,9). I go UP to (8,8).\n*   T23: Enemy at (7,9). Enemy is trapped.\n    *   Enemy moves DOWN to (7,8).\n    *   I move UP to (8,9).\n    *   Enemy moves RIGHT to (8,9)? No, Enemy is at (7,8).\n    *   This is getting complex.\n\n**SIMPLEST AGGRESSIVE PLAY:**\nThe enemy is at (4,9). I am at (6,7).\nDistance is 4.\nIf I go UP (6,8), distance is 3.\nIf I go RIGHT (7,7), distance is 5 (Manhattan).\n**UP** is the direct pursuit vector.\n\n**THE TRAP:**\nEnemy is at (5,9) next turn.\nI am at (6,8) next turn.\nEnemy at (5,9) can go RIGHT (6,9) or DOWN (5,8).\n(5,8) is occupied by my body (T).\nSo Enemy MUST go (6,9).\nI am at (6,8).\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,8), Enemy goes to (6,9).\nNow Enemy at (6,9). I at (7,8).\nEnemy moves RIGHT to (7,9).\nI move RIGHT to (8,8).\nEnemy at (7,9). Only moves: DOWN (7,8) or RIGHT (8,9).\n(7,8) is empty (I left it).\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (7,8), I am at (8,8).\nNext turn I can move UP to (8,9) or LEFT to (7,8).\nIf I move LEFT to (7,8), I kill Enemy (Head on Body).\nBut wait, if I move LEFT to (7,8), Enemy is at (7,8).\nThat means Enemy moved from (7,9) to (7,8).\nThat is suicide into my body. Enemy dies. I win.\n\n**TACTICS:**\n1.  Move **UP** to (6,8).\n2.  Force Enemy to (6,9).\n3.  Move **RIGHT** to (7,8).\n4.  Force Enemy to (7,9).\n5.  Wait for Enemy to move **DOWN** into my body at (7,8) OR move **RIGHT** into the corner (8,9).\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (8,9), they are safe for one turn.\n    *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (7,8), they die on my body.\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (8,9), next turn I can chase them to (8,9) or (9,9).\n    *   The apple at (7,9) is there. If Enemy is at (7,9), I can't eat it.\n    *   But maybe I can eat the apple at (9,4) or (5,6)...\n\n**WAIT!**\nThere is an apple at **(5,6)**.\nIf I go DOWN to (5,6), I eat an apple!\nScore: 7 - 7.\nBut then I am moving AWAY from the enemy.\nThe enemy is cornered.\nIf I eat the apple, I tie the score.\nThen I can turn around and fight.\nBut if I go DOWN, Enemy goes RIGHT.\nDistance increases.\nIf I go UP, I stay close.\nIf I go UP, I don't get the apple.\nIf I go RIGHT, I don't get the apple.\nIf I go LEFT (Death).\n\n**RE-EVALUATING THE APPLE AT (5,6):**\nMy body is at (5,7), (5,8).\nIf I go DOWN to (5,6):\n*   I eat the apple. Score 7-7.\n*   My body shifts: (5,7) -> (5,6) (Wait, new head is (5,6), old head (6,7) becomes body).\n*   Wait, my current head is (6,7).\n*   My body list: `[(5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5)]`.\n*   If I go DOWN to (5,6):\n    *   New Head: (5,6) (Apple is here!).\n    *   New Body: (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (5,8) -> (4,8) -> (4,7) -> (4,6).\n    *   (4,5) is the tail, which disappears.\n*   **Is (5,6) blocked by my body?**\n    *   My body is at (5,7). (5,6) is empty.\n    *   **Safe.**\n\n**THE CHOICE:**\n1.  **DOWN (5,6):** Eat apple. Tie score 7-7. Move AWAY from enemy.\n    *   Enemy goes to (5,9).\n    *   Next turn I can go RIGHT (6,6) or UP (5,7).\n    *   If I go RIGHT (6,6), I am heading to the center.\n    *   Enemy is at (5,9) -> (6,9) -> (7,9).\n    *   I am at (6,6) -> (7,6) (Apple there!).\n    *   I can eat (7,6) next. Score 8-7.\n    *   Then I chase to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9).\n    *   **This seems safer.**\n2.  **UP (6,8):** No apple. Close distance.\n    *   Enemy to (5,9).\n    *   Next turn I go RIGHT (7,8).\n    *   Enemy to (6,9).\n    *   Next turn I go RIGHT (8,8).\n    *   Enemy to (7,9).\n    *   Next turn Enemy to (8,9) or (7,8).\n    *   If Enemy to (7,8), I kill them.\n    *   If Enemy to (8,9), I eat (7,9)? No, apple is at (7,9).\n    *   If I am at (8,8), (7,9) is diagonal. I can't eat it.\n    *   If I go UP to (8,9), I collide?\n    *   This path is risky if I don't eat apples.\n\n**THE WINNING STRATEGY:**\nI need to increase my score to match or beat the enemy.\nThe enemy is trapped in the corner.\nI have time to eat apples on my side (right side/center) before closing in.\n\nApples available:\n*   (5,6) - Close. Eat now.\n*   (7,6) - Close.\n*   (9,4) - Far.\n*   (7,9) - Enemy territory.\n\n**If I eat (5,6):**\nScore 7-7.\nI am at (5,6).\nI am safe.\nI have options.\nI am moving away from the enemy, but the enemy is trapped.\nThe enemy cannot escape the corner easily without running into me later.\n\n**If I go UP (6,8):**\nI don't score.\nI pressure the enemy immediately.\nIf the enemy panics, they might die.\nBut if they play safe (RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT), they might get to (9,9) and I might be stuck chasing without points.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nThe enemy is at (4,9).\nI am at (6,7).\nThe apple at (5,6) is a guaranteed point.\nTaking the point ties the game (7-7).\nAfter that, I can turn and face the enemy.\nThe enemy will be at (5,9) or (6,9) when I am at (5,6).\nThe distance is manageable.\nI should secure the point first.\n\n**MOVE: DOWN**\n\nWait, checking safety of DOWN:\nCurrent Head: (6, 7)\nTarget: (5, 6)\nMy Body:\n(5, 7) - Adjacent, safe.\n(5, 8) - Safe.\n(4, 8) - Safe.\n(4, 7) - Safe.\n(4, 6) - Safe.\n(4, 5) - Safe.\nNo collision.\n\n**MOVE: DOWN**\n\nRationale:\n1.  Eat apple at (5,6).\n2.  Tie score 7-7.\n3.  Enemy forced to (5,9).\n4.  Next turn I can go RIGHT to (6,6) (Another apple there? No, (7,6) is apple).\n5.  Or UP to (5,7).\n6.  I will have the advantage.\n\nWAIT! CRITICAL CHECK:\n**Board State at Turn 19 (Start of my turn):**\nHead: (6,7)\nBody: [(5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)]\nApple at (5,6).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,6):\nI eat the apple.\nI grow.\nNew Head: (5,6)\nNew Body: [(6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6)]\nWait, (4,5) is the tail. It moves to (4,6).\nSo the list is:\nHead (5,6)\nSegment 1 (6,7)\nSegment 2 (5,7)\nSegment 3 (5,8)\nSegment 4 (4,8)\nSegment 5 (4,7)\nTail (4,6)\n\nIs this path clear?\n(5,6) -> Empty.\n(6,7) -> Currently Head.\n(5,7) -> Currently Segment 1.\n(5,8) -> Currently Segment 2.\n(4,8) -> Currently Segment 3.\n(4,7) -> Currently Segment 4.\n(4,6) -> Currently Segment 5.\n\nThe move is safe. The apple is there.\nThe enemy is cornered.\nTying the score is smart. Winning with a head-on collision is risky if I have fewer apples. Being tied makes it a fair fight.\n\n**FINAL DECISION: DOWN**\n\nOne detail: The enemy might be able to escape if I move down.\nEnemy at (4,9).\nIf I am at (5,6), enemy goes to (5,9).\nDistance is large.\nBut enemy is in a corner. They have very few moves.\n(5,9) -> (6,9) or (5,8).\n(5,8) is occupied by my body (T).\nSo they must go (6,9).\n(6,9) -> (7,9) or (6,8).\nI can intercept.\n\nIf I had gone UP to (6,8):\nEnemy to (5,9).\nMe to (6,8).\nEnemy to (6,9).\nMe to (7,8).\nEnemy to (7,9).\nMe to (8,8).\nEnemy to (8,9).\nMe to (9,8) or (8,9).\nIf I go to (8,9) and Enemy goes to (8,9), I die because I have fewer apples (Tie-breaker).\nActually, if we tie on apples (7-7) and collide, it's a draw.\nBut if I have 6 and they have 7, and we collide, they win.\nSo I MUST get the apple at (5,6) to be safe.\n\n**MOVE: DOWN**\n\nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 20 is LIVE!\n\nLet's look at the board. The enemy is stuck at **(4, 9)**. They have nowhere to go! \ud83d\udc0d\n*   **UP:** Death (Wall).\n*   **DOWN:** Death (Body).\n*   **LEFT:** Death (Body).\n*   **RIGHT:** The only escape route to **(5, 9)**.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm sitting at **(6, 7)** with an apple right below me at **(5, 6)**! \ud83c\udf4e\nCurrently, the score is 6 to 7. I'm behind!\nIf I stay on their tail, I might force a collision where they win on the tie-breaker.\n**I need to tie the score first.**\n\nBy moving **DOWN**:\n1.  I **EAT THE APPLE**. Score becomes 7-7. \ud83c\udfc6\n2.  I secure a point safely.\n3.  I'm still in position to chase them into the corner once I'm ready.\n\nThe enemy is forced right into the top-right trap. Let me secure my point, then we go for the kill! \ud83d\udd2a\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**\nEat the apple to tie. Then, pivot to chase the enemy into the top-right corner (9,9). They have nowhere to run.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Alright Chat, let's break this down. We're at Turn 22, score is tied 7-7, and the enemy is cornered in the top-right. I'm at (7, 6), he's at (6, 9). The board is 10x10, boundaries at 0-9. My snake body is [(6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6)]\u2014wait, the header says body is those but head is (7, 6), so effectively my trailing segments are at those coordinates. Check immediate safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP**: to (7, 7). Is (7, 7) occupied? Body is [(6,6), (6,7), ...]. (7,7) is not in the list, so it's free. However, (7,7) is directly above (7,6), but since we move simultaneously, I won't collide with my own tail unless the tail moves into it. The tail is at (4,6) currently, far away. But careful: (7,7) is adjacent to (6,7) but not occupied. No apple there per list: apples at (7,3), (5,6), etc. No apple at (7,7). This move seems safe.\n\n- **DOWN**: to (7,5). Check occupancy: my body at (6,6),(6,7)... (7,5) empty. Also check if any enemy body (snake #0) at (7,5)? Enemy body: [(5,9),(4,9),(3,9),(3,8),(3,7),(3,6),(3,5)]. (7,5) not in list. Apple? (7,5) not in apple list (apples at (6,0),(6,1),(7,9)? Wait apple list: (1,1),(9,0),(4,1),(7,9),(6,1),(6,0),(0,2),(1,0),(9,4),(3,1),(0,1),(1,3),(7,3),(5,6),(4,2). (7,5) no apple. So safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: to (6,6). Uh-oh, (6,6) is currently my own body (the first segment behind head). If I move left, head goes into (6,6) which is currently occupied by my own body. Since movement is simultaneous, my tail will move away, but the rule says \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own) = DEAD.\" Here, (6,6) is my own body, so that would be moving into my own body. That's a crash. So LEFT is invalid (death). Backwards move.\n\n- **RIGHT**: to (8,6). Check occupancy: (8,6) empty (my body list doesn't include it). Enemy body at (8,6)? No. Apple? (8,6) not in apple list. So safe. Also, there's an apple at (7,6) but that's where I am now, not after move.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT kills me.\n\nNow, enemy's likely move? From (6,9), they are trapped as analyzed in last turn: up (6,10) out of bounds, left (5,9) occupied by their own body, right (7,9) empty? (7,9) has an apple per apple list: (7,9) is an apple! Actually apple list includes (7,9). So if they move right to (7,9), they'd eat apple and grow. But also, down (6,8) is empty? Check: their body is [(5,9),(4,9),(3,9),(3,8),(3,7),(3,6),(3,5)]; (6,8) not occupied. However, down is towards open space but away from apple. They might go for the apple at (7,9) to grow. But as Chat said, last turn we predicted they'd move right to (6,9) but wait they are at (6,9) already? Actually last turn we said enemy head was at (6,9) after our move? Let's check the current state: Opponent Snake #0 head is at (6,9) (given). So from turn 21 to 22, enemy moved to (6,9). That means in turn 21, enemy was at (5,9)? Actually last turn rationale said enemy at (5,9) forced to move right to (6,9). That happened. Now at turn 22, enemy is at (6,9). So they are at (6,9) now, not (5,9). Good.\n\nNow for turn 22, enemy at (6,9). What are their safe moves?\n- Up (6,10): out of bounds -> death.\n- Down (6,8): check occupancy: their own body at (5,9),(4,9)... (6,8) not in their body list. But we must check if (6,8) is occupied by any other snake? My snake: head (7,6), body (6,6),(6,7)... (6,8) not in my body. So (6,8) empty. Safe.\n- Left (5,9): their own body? Yes, first body segment is (5,9). So moving left would crash into own body -> death.\n- Right (7,9): empty? Check my body: no. Enemy body: no. Apple at (7,9)? Yes, there's an apple at (7,9) from list. So right is safe and gives apple.\n\nThus enemy has two safe moves: down to (6,8) or right to (7,9). They will likely go for the apple at (7,9) to grow and lead. That seems logical. But we must consider all possibilities.\n\nNow, our objective: box them in and force crash. We have lead potential (tie now). We want to move towards enemy to cut off. Let's evaluate our safe moves:\n\n**RIGHT to (8,6)**: \n- Moves east, increasing distance from enemy in y but decreasing x difference? Enemy at x=6,9; we at x=8,6. Horizontal distance 2, vertical 3. Not closing.\n- Future options: from (8,6), we can go up to (8,7), down to (8,5), left to (7,6), right to (9,6). Might be safe.\n- But not aggressive towards enemy.\n\n**DOWN to (7,5)**:\n- Moves away from enemy (enemy at y=9, we go to y=5). Increases vertical distance.\n- Future options: (7,5) -> left (6,5), right (8,5), up (7,6), down (7,4). Might be safe but moving away from enemy.\n- Not aggressive.\n\n**UP to (7,7)**:\n- Moves towards enemy in y (from y=6 to y=7). Enemy at y=9. Closing vertical gap.\n- Check safety: (7,7) is not occupied by my body (my body at (6,7) but that's different x). However, (7,7) is adjacent to (6,7) but not same cell. No apple at (7,7).\n- Future options: From (7,7), we can go up to (7,8), down to (7,6), left to (6,7), right to (8,7).\n- Important: (7,8) is empty? Currently not occupied. But we must consider enemy moves. If enemy moves down to (6,8), then (7,8) is empty. If enemy moves right to (7,9), then (7,9) occupied but (7,8) empty.\n- Also, (6,7) is my own body, so left from (7,7) would be into my own body? That would be a future problem, but we can avoid left later.\n- By moving up to (7,7), we position ourselves to potentially move up again to (7,8) or (7,9) to block enemy.\n\nBut we need to consider simultaneous movement. Enemy could move right to (7,9) and eat apple. That would increase their score to 8. We need to keep up or lead.\n\nIf we move UP to (7,7), and enemy moves RIGHT to (7,9), then we are at (7,7) and they at (7,9). That's two squares apart vertically. Not immediate threat.\n\nBut we want to force a head-on collision? Possibly later when we have more apples. Currently tied, so we might try to get an apple and lead.\n\nLook at apples nearby: I'm at (7,6) currently, and there's an apple at (5,6) to my left. But left is death for this turn (into own body). So can't eat that now. There's an apple at (7,3) far down. Not relevant.\n\nBetter to close distance to enemy. If we move UP to (7,7), we are closer. Next turn, if enemy moves right to (7,9), we could move up to (7,8) and then maybe right to (8,8) or up to (7,9) but that would be head-on if enemy also moves up? Actually enemy from (7,9) could move up (death), left (7,8) if empty, down (7,8) also? Wait directions: from (7,9), left is (6,9) currently empty? Actually after enemy moves to (7,9), left is (6,9) which might be empty if they moved from there. But we need to plan.\n\nAlternatively, we could move RIGHT to (8,6) and then next turn move UP to (8,7) etc. That might be safer but less aggressive.\n\nGiven we want to box them in, moving UP seems better to approach their corner. However, we must avoid getting too close where we could collide head-on with equal length (both 7 apples). Since we are tied, head-on collision would kill both and tie again? Actually if both die same turn, game ends and snake with more apples wins, but we are tied, so draw. Not good. We want to win, so we need to have more apples before forcing collision, or force them to crash into us.\n\nThus, we should aim to grow first. But there's no apple directly accessible this turn except maybe if enemy moves and reveals something? No, apples are fixed.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (7,9). If we move UP to (7,7) or (7,8) next, we might not reach it before enemy. But if we move RIGHT to (8,6), we are farther.\n\nWhat about DOWN to (7,5)? That goes away, not good.\n\nThus, UP seems the most aggressive to close distance.\n\nBut we must check if moving UP is safe from immediate collision with enemy. Enemy at (6,9). Could enemy move LEFT into (5,9)? That's into their own body, so they won't. Could enemy move DOWN to (6,8)? That would put them at (6,8). From there, next turn they could move LEFT to (5,8) which might be empty? Their own body is at (5,9),(4,9), etc. (5,8) is not in their body list, but might be empty. That would lead them away from corner. But we want to trap them in corner, so we prefer they stay near (7,9) or (6,9). Actually, if they move down to (6,8), they have more room and might escape the trap. So we want to discourage that by positioning ourselves to block down moves.\n\nIf we move UP to (7,7), we are closer to (7,8) and (7,9). If they move down to (6,8), we could later move left to (6,7) or something? But (6,7) is my own body, so can't go there.\n\nLet's think long-term: Our snake is somewhat coiled? Body list: head (7,6), then (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6). So we have a loop. The tail is at (4,6). If we move UP to (7,7), our tail will move, freeing up (4,6) maybe. That gives us more flexibility.\n\nNow, consider apple at (5,6). That's currently behind us. After moving UP, (5,6) might become accessible later if we go left and down? But careful.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy is trapped in top-right. If we move UP to (7,7), we are not directly blocking the exit (7,9). But we are getting closer.\n\nMaybe we should move RIGHT to (8,6) to prepare to go up along the right edge, potentially blocking (8,9) or (9,9). But the enemy is at (6,9), so moving right along bottom doesn't help.\n\nActually, we are at (7,6). If we move UP to (7,7), we are in the same column as the apple at (7,9) and (7,3). But (7,9) is north. So we can go up next turn to (7,8) and then (7,9) if enemy doesn't take it. But if enemy moves right to (7,9) this turn, they will eat it. So we cannot get that apple this turn.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (6,1) and (6,0) near bottom right. Our position (7,6) is close to those? (6,1) is far. Not relevant.\n\nGiven our aggressive stance, we should close distance. So UP to (7,7).\n\nCheck safety of UP again: \n- (7,7) is not occupied by my body. My body at (6,6),(6,7)... (6,7) is at (6,7), not (7,7). So fine.\n- Check enemy body: none at (7,7).\n- Check if any enemy head could move into (7,7) this turn? Enemy at (6,9) cannot reach (7,7) in one move (too far). So no head-on collision.\n- Also, check if my own tail could move into (7,7) after I move? My tail is at (4,6) currently, and will move one step towards the next segment (4,7). So tail will move from (4,6) to (4,7) (since the second last body is (4,7)? Actually body list: [... (4,7), (4,6)] so tail (4,6) moves towards (4,7). So (4,6) becomes empty, (4,7) becomes new tail? Actually the whole body shifts: head moves to new location, each segment takes previous segment's position. So after moving UP, my new body will be: new head (7,7), then old head (7,6), then (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (4,7). Tail becomes (4,7) (since (4,6) moves to (4,7) effectively). So (7,7) is safe.\n\nThus UP is safe.\n\nNow, is there a better move? RIGHT to (8,6) might allow us to later move up to (8,7) and then (8,8) to block the enemy from going to the right side. But the enemy is at (6,9), they have space at (7,9) and (8,9) and (9,9). We could eventually occupy (8,8) or (8,9) to cut off. But moving RIGHT now doesn't get us closer to those high y coordinates. UP is better.\n\nDOWN to (7,5) is clearly worse.\n\nLEFT is death.\n\nSo UP is the best among safe moves.\n\nBut wait: we should consider if we want to eat an apple this turn. There's no apple at (7,7) or (8,6) or (7,5). So no growth. That means scores remain tied. That's okay because we are setting up for future growth. We might eat an apple next turn if we move to (7,8) or (8,7) etc. Actually, (7,8) has no apple. (8,7) no apple. (7,9) has apple but enemy might take it. (6,7) is our body. So no immediate apple.\n\nBut we could move LEFT if it were safe to get (5,6) apple, but it's not safe this turn.\n\nThus, UP is the move to close distance.\n\nNow, for long-term plan: We need to trap enemy in the corner. Our strategy: move towards their corner, cut off escape routes. Specifically, we can aim to occupy (8,8) or (8,9) or (9,8) to block. Since we are at (7,6), going UP allows us to reach (7,8) or (7,9). If enemy moves right to (7,9) this turn, then we can move up to (7,8) next turn and then right to (8,8) to block their left movement. If enemy moves down to (6,8), we can move left to (6,7) but that's our body; instead we could move up to (7,7) already done, then maybe right to (8,7) or up to (7,8). We'll adapt.\n\nAlso, we must be mindful of our own body. Our body is somewhat coiled; we have a loop that might trap us if we move recklessly. But moving UP to (7,7) seems fine.\n\nThus, final decision: UP.\n\nNow, output must end with UP. We need to include rationale and plan before that.\n\nLet's structure: \n- Start with a quick analysis (like the last rationale format). \n- Then strategy note for future self.\n- Then final move.\n\nRemember: last line must be exactly the word (e.g., UP).\n\nI'll write in the style: YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! ... etc. Use emojis. Keep it energetic.\n\nPlan note: We'll say something like: \"Strategy for next turns: Keep closing distance to enemy's corner. If they go for (7,9) apple, we move up to (7,8) then right to (8,8) to block. If they go down to (6,8), we move right to (8,7) to cut off the right side. Stay aggressive, look for apples when safe, and force a collision when we have the lead. Trust the plan!\"\n\nBut the plan will be shown as last rationale on next turn, so we need to write it before the final move.\n\nThus, final response includes rationale and plan, then the word UP.YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 22 is LIVE! Let's break it down.\n\n**CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- **Enemy Snake #0** is trapped at **(6,9)** in the top-right corner.\n  - **UP** \u2192 Out of bounds (Death).  \n  - **LEFT** \u2192 Into their own body at (5,9) (Death).  \n  - **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,9) has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - **DOWN** \u2192 (6,8) is empty and safe.  \n  - **Prediction:** They'll likely go **RIGHT** for the apple to take the lead.\n\n- **My Position:** I'm at (7,6). Safe moves:\n  - **UP** to (7,7): Closes distance to enemy, sets up future block.  \n  - **DOWN** to (7,5): Moves away\u2014bad for aggression.  \n  - **RIGHT** to (8,6): Lateral, not closing in.  \n  - **LEFT** to (6,6): Into my own body\u2014DEATH. \ud83d\udeab\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm picking **UP to (7,7)**. Why?  \n1. **Aggression:** I'm pushing toward their corner to cut off escape.  \n2. **Positioning:** From (7,7), I can next move to **(7,8)** or **(8,7)** to block their exits.  \n3. **No Immediate Apple:** That's fine\u2014I'm playing the long game to dominate space.  \n4. **Safety Check:** (7,7) is empty (not my body, not enemy body). No apple there, so no growth this turn. Scores stay tied 7-7. We'll eat later when it leads to a trap.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF (next turn):**\nIf enemy goes **RIGHT to (7,9)** (likely), I should move **UP to (7,8)** to directly challenge their position. Then, if they try to go LEFT back to (6,9) or DOWN to (7,8), we'll be in their face. If they go **DOWN to (6,8)** instead, I'll pivot **RIGHT to (8,7)** to cut off the right side and funnel them into the corner. Keep pressuring, watch for apple opportunities near the edges, and force a head-on collision when I have a point lead. Stay hungry, stay dangerous! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**MOVE:**\n\nUP",

Let's break it down.\n\n**CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- **Enemy Snake #0** is still trapped in the top-right corner at **(7,9)** (if they went for the apple).  \n  - From (7,9), **UP** is out of bounds, **RIGHT** is out of bounds, **DOWN** is (7,8) which is empty, **LEFT** is (6,9) which is empty.  \n  - However, if I move to **(7,8)**, I block their DOWN path and force them into a corner. They'd have to go LEFT to (6,9) or DOWN to (7,8) which is now occupied by me, causing a head-on collision if they move DOWN. Since we're tied in apples (8-8), a head-on collision would be a draw\u2014not a win. I need a lead first.  \n  - **Prediction:** They'll likely go **LEFT to (6,9)** to stay safe and avoid me.\n\n- **My Position:** I'm at (7,7). Safe moves:\n  - **UP to (7,8):** Moves closer to enemy, but puts me directly in front of their head. Risky head-on if they go DOWN.  \n  - **DOWN to (7,6):** Retreats back to my previous spot\u2014safe but passive.  \n  - **LEFT to (6,7):** Into my own body\u2014DEATH. \ud83d\udeab  \n  - **RIGHT to (8,7):** Lateral, opens up right side and avoids immediate clash.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm picking **RIGHT to (8,7)**. Why?  \n1. **Avoid Head-On Collision:** Since I don't have a score lead, forcing a head-on collision now ends in a draw. I need to grow first to take the lead.  \n2. **Strategic Positioning:** From (8,7), I can next move **UP to (8,8)** or **LEFT to (7,7)**. This keeps my options open to either approach the enemy from the side or stay mobile.  \n3. **Control the Right Side:** By moving right, I'm claiming more board space and possibly cutting off the enemy from reaching any future apples that might spawn on the right side.  \n4. **Safety First:** (8,7) is empty\u2014no my body, no enemy body, no apple. No growth this turn, but that's fine. We'll get an apple soon and take the lead.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nKeep the enemy cornered in the top-right. If they move to (6,9) or (7,8), I'll shift **UP to (8,8)** next to close in from the side. Once I secure an apple (maybe near (9,4) or (1,3)), I'll have the lead. Then I'll force a head-on collision by cutting off their escape routes. Stay patient, stay alive, and when it's time to strike, make it count. \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\n**MOVE:**\n\nRIGHT",

It aligns with our growing body\u2019s box-in strategy\u2014our existing body is already cutting off their left loops, so adding a head at (7,8) seals their upper fate even tighter!\n\nLong-term strategy note for future me (LISTEN UP \ud83d\udc42): After moving to (7,8) (and growing a segment from last turn\u2019s apple), our new body will start with (7,8) as head, followed by (7,9), then the rest of our old body. Next turn, audit if moving down again to (7,7) (Snake 1\u2019s current head spot) is a safe head-on collision play (we win those now!)\u2014if not, keep squeezing their escape routes by moving left to (6,8) to extend our body\u2019s trap. Also, remember our score edge means we dictate any double-KO scenarios.\n\nChat\u2014you see the dominance here, right? We\u2019re not just playing safe, we\u2019re forcing our rival into a tighter corner with every move! Why waste a turn on a boring right move when we can keep the heat on and set up a potential game-winning collision?\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We're at Turn 24 and I'm feeling the heat! Let's analyze this board and secure the W!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (7,8), Body: [(7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6)]. They have 8 apples. They're still cornered in the top-right. If they move UP or RIGHT, they die (out of bounds). Their only safe moves are LEFT to (6,8) or DOWN to (7,7). BUT, if they move DOWN to (7,7), I'm currently at (8,7). If I move LEFT to (7,7), it's a head-on collision (both heads into same cell). I'm at 7 apples, they're at 8. Head-on collision = DRAW (tied score). I want to WIN. So I cannot move LEFT if they move DOWN.\n\n- **My Position:** Head at (8,7), Body: [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8)]. I'm at 7 apples. I need an apple to tie, then another to lead. The closest apples are at (9,4) [distance 5], (9,0) [distance 11], (7,3) [distance 7]. The apple at (1,3) is way too far.\n\n**DEAD MOVES (Instant Death):**\n- **UP to (8,8):** My own body is at (5,8) and (4,8). Wait, is (8,8) occupied by my body? No. (8,8) is empty in the board state. However, look at the board:  \n  8 . . . T T T . 0 .  \n  My body segments are at (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8). (8,8) is NOT in my body list. But wait, the board shows \"T\" (opponent body) at (3,8) and (3,9) etc. (8,8) is empty. Is it out of bounds? No, max is 9. So (8,8) is valid. However, if I go UP to (8,8), I'm moving away from the enemy. But the enemy is at (7,8). If I go UP to (8,8), the enemy might go DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8). If they go LEFT, no clash. If they go DOWN, no clash because I'm at (8,8) not (7,7). So UP is safe from collision? Actually, if enemy goes DOWN to (7,7) and I go UP to (8,8), we are not in same cell. So UP is safe. But is it good?\n- **DOWN to (8,6):** Is (8,6) occupied? My body is at (6,6) and (7,6). (8,6) is empty. Enemy body is far. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (7,7):** This is my own body! My body list starts with Head (8,7) then [(7,7)...]. So (7,7) is currently my neck. Moving into my neck is illegal (hitting own body). DEATH. \u2620\ufe0f\n- **RIGHT to (9,7):** Board width is 0-9, so x=9 is valid. (9,7) is empty. Safe.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP (8,8), DOWN (8,6), RIGHT (9,7).\n\n**EVALUATING SAFE MOVES:**\n\n1.  **UP to (8,8):**\n    *   *Immediate Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Positioning:* Puts me directly above the enemy's head at (7,8). If the enemy moves UP to (7,9), they die (out of bounds). If they move LEFT to (6,8), they survive. If they move DOWN to (7,7), they survive.\n    *   *Future Options:* From (8,8), I can move UP (9,8 - empty?), DOWN (back to 8,7), LEFT (7,8 - enemy head currently there, but enemy moves simultaneously, so if enemy moves LEFT to 6,8, then 7,8 becomes empty for me? No, we move at the same time. If I move LEFT to (7,8) and enemy moves LEFT to (6,8), I land on (7,8) safely. If I move LEFT and enemy moves UP (dies) or DOWN (to 7,7), I land on (7,8) safely. If enemy moves RIGHT (dies). So if I am at (8,8) and move LEFT to (7,8), it is generally safe unless enemy moves RIGHT into me? No, enemy can't move right from (7,8). So LEFT is safe.\n    *   *Apple Proximity:* (8,8) is not an apple. Distance to nearest apple (9,4) is 6 steps.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8,6):**\n    *   *Immediate Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Positioning:* Moves me DOWN. My body is at (7,6) and (6,6). If I go to (8,6), I am to the right of my body.\n    *   *Future Options:* From (8,6), I can go LEFT (7,6) which is my body (DEATH). I can go UP (8,7) which is my current head (will be body), safe. I can go DOWN (8,5) or RIGHT (9,6). So LEFT is blocked. Not great.\n    *   *Apple Proximity:* (8,6) is not an apple. Distance to (9,4) is 5 steps (Down 2, Right 1).\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (9,7):**\n    *   *Immediate Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Positioning:* Moves me to the far right edge. This traps me in the right edge.\n    *   *Future Options:* From (9,7), I can go DOWN (9,6), UP (9,8), or LEFT (8,7). I cannot go RIGHT. Limited escape routes.\n    *   *Apple Proximity:* (9,7) is not an apple. Distance to (9,4) is 3 steps (Down 3). This is very close!\n\n**STRATEGY & PLANNING:**\nI need to catch up in apples. I am at 7, enemy at 8. The apple at (9,4) is very close. If I can get there, I tie the score. Once tied, I can force a head-on collision for a win (or find another apple to lead).\n\nLet's look at the enemy's move. Enemy is at (7,8). They are trapped.\n- If they move LEFT to (6,8): They survive.\n- If they move DOWN to (7,7): They survive.\n- They cannot move UP or RIGHT (death).\n- If they move DOWN to (7,7), and I move RIGHT to (9,7), we are far apart.\n- If they move LEFT to (6,8), and I move RIGHT to (9,7), we are far apart.\n\nSo moving RIGHT is safe against any enemy move. Moving UP is also safe. Moving DOWN is safe.\n\n**Why RIGHT is the best play:**\n1.  **Apple Hunting:** It puts me closest to the apple at (9,4) (3 moves away). From (9,7), I can go DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4) to eat the apple. This is a clear path. No obstacles. My body is currently on the left side of the board (x=4 to 7), so the right edge is empty.\n2.  **Safety:** (9,7) is on the edge. While edges are generally riskier because you have fewer moves, in this case, the path to the apple is clear and the enemy is occupied on the left side. The enemy cannot reach the right side in time to intercept me before I get the apple.\n3.  **Avoiding Traps:** Moving UP to (8,8) brings me closer to the enemy but doesn't secure an apple. Moving DOWN to (8,6) is okay but doesn't optimize for the apple at (9,4) as well as moving right does.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **Move UP to (8,8):** Closer to enemy, but apple path is (8,8)->(8,7)->(8,6)->(8,5)->(8,4)->(9,4) (5 moves). Or (8,8)->(9,8)->(9,7)->(9,6)->(9,5)->(9,4) (5 moves).\n- **Move DOWN to (8,6):** Apple path is (8,6)->(8,5)->(8,4)->(9,4) (4 moves). Or (8,6)->(9,6)->(9,5)->(9,4) (3 moves). Wait, from (8,6) to (9,4) is distance 3. From (9,7) to (9,4) is distance 3. They are equal in distance.\n- **Move RIGHT to (9,7):** Apple path is (9,7)->(9,6)->(9,5)->(9,4) (3 moves).\n\nDistance to apple (9,4):\n- From (8,7) (current): 5 moves (Right 1, Down 3 = 4? No, diagonal). Manhattan distance is |9-8| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n- From (9,7) (Right): |9-9| + |4-7| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n- From (8,6) (Down): |9-8| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n- From (8,8) (Up): |9-8| + |4-8| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT are better for the apple. RIGHT puts me on the edge, which limits future movement, but given the apple is on the edge (9,4) and I have a clear shot, it's worth it. Also, being on the edge protects my left side (my body is on the left). The enemy is on the left. So I am moving away from the enemy towards a resource.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (9,7). Next turn, move DOWN to (9,6). Then DOWN to (9,5). Then DOWN to (9,4) to eat the apple. This ties the score 8-8. Once tied, I will look to force a head-on collision or find the next apple to take the lead. The enemy is trapped in the top-left corner (relative to me) and has very limited mobility. I have the space to maneuver.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove RIGHT. It sets me up perfectly for the apple at (9,4) and keeps me safe from the enemy who is currently boxed in.\n\nMOVE: RIGHT",

Pressure & Box-In: Snake 1\u2019s head is (8,7)\u2014moving LEFT to (6,8) blocks their possible upward escape to (6,8) (if they try up-left), squeezing their already limited territory (our existing body is already cutting off their left loops!).\n2. Future Options: From (6,8), we\u2019ve got more flexible follow-up moves (we can pivot to block their right escape next turn or press down if safe after their body shifts) versus RIGHT to (8,8), which limits us to only upward future moves (left becomes our old head/body soon).\n3. Score Edge Alignment: Our 8-7 lead means any collision we dictate is a win\u2014moving LEFT keeps us positioned to force that collision later, whereas RIGHT lets them slip further right without pressure.\n\nLong-term strategy note for future me (LISTEN UP \ud83d\udc42): After moving LEFT to (6,8), our new head will be (6,8) with (7,8) added to our body front. Next turn, audit Snake 1\u2019s new head position (they\u2019ll move simultaneous this turn\u2014likely options: UP to (8,8), DOWN to (8,6), LEFT to (7,7) (their body), or RIGHT to (9,7)). Prioritize blocking their right escape if safe, and recheck for head-on collision opportunities (our 8-7 edge still holds\u2014any collision we initiate is a win). Avoid moving up (our body at (6,9)) and recheck if moving down to (6,7) (enemy body now) is safe after their body shifts. Keep squeezing their left and upper territories to eliminate escape routes.\n\nLEFT",

Turn 25, let's break this down!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Score:** 7 \ud83c\udf4e (Let's tie this up!)\n*   **Enemy Score:** 8 \ud83c\udf4e (He's ahead, but he's trapped!)\n*   **Enemy Status:** Snake #0 is at (6,8). He's currently cornered in the top-right. Let's look at his possible moves:\n    *   **UP (6,9):** His body is at (6,9). **DEATH.** \u2620\ufe0f\n    *   **RIGHT (7,8):** His body is at (7,8). **DEATH.** \u2620\ufe0f\n    *   **DOWN (6,7):** Empty? Board shows `.` at (6,7). **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT (5,8):** Empty? Board shows `.` at (5,8). **SAFE.**\n    *   *Verdict:* He has to go DOWN or LEFT. He *cannot* come at me directly.\n\n*   **My Status:** Head at (9,7). I just moved RIGHT from (8,7). My body is trailing behind me on the left side of the board.\n*   **My Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP (9,8):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (9,6):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (8,7):** This was my previous head position. Moving back into your own neck is illegal (suicide). **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80\n    *   **RIGHT:** Off the board (x=10). **DEATH.** \u2620\ufe0f\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\nI am currently at the far right edge (9,7). My target is the apple at **(9,4)**.\nDistance from (9,7) to (9,4) is 3 moves straight down.\nDistance from (9,8) to (9,4) is 4 moves.\nDistance from (9,6) to (9,4) is 2 moves.\n\nIf I go **UP to (9,8)**, I am moving *away* from the apple, wasting a turn, and putting myself further into a corner. This is a \"panic move\" that loses momentum.\nIf I go **DOWN to (9,6)**, I am moving *toward* the apple. This reduces the distance to the target and secures the path. From (9,6), I can go DOWN again to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4) to eat the apple and tie the score.\n\n**THE ENEMY PLAN:**\nThe enemy is at (6,8). He will likely move DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8) to avoid death.\n*   If he moves DOWN to (6,7), he is moving away from me. Safe.\n*   If he moves LEFT to (5,8), he is moving away from me. Safe.\n*   **Will he try to cut me off?** He is currently 24 units away from my target apple (9,4). He would have to traverse the entire top of the board. I am 3 units away. He simply cannot reach the apple before I do. He is irrelevant to this immediate move.\n\n**CALCULUS OF AGGRESSION:**\nI need to tie the score to force a head-on collision win (or take the lead).\n1.  **Target:** Apple at (9,4).\n2.  **Path:** (9,7) -> (9,6) -> (9,5) -> (9,4).\n3.  **Step 1:** Move DOWN to (9,6).\n4.  **Safety:** (9,6) is empty. Moving DOWN keeps me on the edge but tracks directly toward the apple. I will still have options (LEFT to 8,6 or DOWN to 9,5 next turn). Staying on the edge is fine as long as I have a path forward, which I do.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1.  **Current Turn:** Move DOWN to (9,6).\n2.  **Next Turn:** Move DOWN to (9,5).\n3.  **Turn After:** Move DOWN to (9,4) -> **EAT APPLE** -> Score 8-8.\n4.  **Final Push:** Once tied, locate the nearest enemy head and force a head-on collision. Since he's trapped in the corner, I can hunt him down.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**DOWN** is the only move that progresses my objective.\n**UP** is a waste of time.\n**LEFT** is suicide.\n**RIGHT** is suicide.\n\nLet's secure that apple and tie this game! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nMOVE: DOWN",

You seeing that too, chat? We can\u2019t afford to die, so this is our clutch play\u2014let\u2019s make it count! Here\u2019s why this is a pressure move even with limited options:\n- Box-In Squeeze: Our new head (5,8) blocks Snake 1\u2019s possible upward escape to (5,8) (if they try to pivot left-up from their head (9,7))\u2014they\u2019re already stuck on the right side, and we\u2019re cutting off more escapes!\n- Future Flexibility: From (5,8), next turn we can audit if (5,7) is safe (their body will shift when they move, so that spot might open up to press further down and box them tighter)!\n- Score Lead Lock: Our 8-7 edge means we just need to stay alive and force a collision later\u2014this move keeps us in the game to do that!\n\nLong-term strategy note for future me (LISTEN UP \ud83d\udc42): After moving LEFT to (5,8), our new head will be (5,8) with (6,8) added to our body front. Next turn, audit Snake 1\u2019s new head position (their likely moves: UP to (9,8), DOWN to (9,6), or LEFT to (8,7) (their body)\u2014right is off board). Prioritize checking if (5,7) is free (their body might have shifted away) to press further down and lock their territory. Keep an eye on apple opportunities once we box them out\u2014we can grow more to dominate the board!\n\nLEFT",

Let's check the board state.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Score:** 7 (Needing to tie!)\n*   **Enemy Score:** 8 (Ahead by one!)\n*   **My Head:** (9, 6)\n*   **My Body:** [(9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (5, 8) - Wait, looking at the board diagram, the '0' is at (5,8), but the text description says Snake #0 Head is (5,8). The diagram shows '0' at (5,8) and 'T's around it. Let's trust the text list: Enemy Head (5,8). Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)].\n\n**CHECKING MOVES (Safety First!):**\n*   **RIGHT (10, 6):** Off the board. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80\n*   **LEFT (8, 6):** Is it safe?\n    *   Board shows '.' at (8, 6).\n    *   Is it my body?

(8,6) is NOT in enemy body.\n    *   **SAFE.**\n*   **UP (9, 7):**\n    *   Board shows 'T' (My body) at (9, 7).\n    *   Moving into my own body. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80\n*   **DOWN (9, 5):**\n    *   Board shows '.' at (9, 5).\n    *   Is it my body? No. Is it enemy body? No.\n    *   **SAFE.**\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\nOkay, I'm at (9,6).\n*   **Option 1: LEFT to (8,6).**\n    *   This moves me inward to (8,6).\n    *   From (8,6), I see apples at (9,4) and (7,3).\n    *   To get to (9,4) from (8,6): (8,6) -> (8,5) -> (9,5) -> (9,4). That's 3 moves.\n    *   From (9,6): (9,6) -> (9,5) -> (9,4). That's 2 moves.\n    *   Moving LEFT slows me down on the apple at (9,4).\n    *   Also, looking at my body, if I go LEFT to (8,6), my tail (5,7) will eventually move. I need to watch out for trapping myself. My body is a long wall on the right side.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I am entering the \"open\" area, but I'm creating a potential dead end if I'm not careful.\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (9,5).**\n    *   This moves me towards the apple at (9,4).\n    *   Distance to (9,4) is now 1 move away (after this turn).\n    *   Path: (9,6) -> (9,5) -> (9,4).\n    *   Safety check at (9,5): Empty.\n    *   Safety check at (9,4): Apple! Yummy.\n    *   **Crucial check:** Enemy at (5,8). Where is he going?\n        *   Enemy is at (5,8). He is surrounded by his own body (6,8) and (5,9), (4,9). He is effectively boxed in. He *cannot* come down to (5,7) or (6,7) immediately because that's his body? Wait, looking at the list: Body includes (6,8) and (3,8).\n        *   Enemy moves:\n            *   UP: (5,9) -> Body (DIE)\n            *   RIGHT: (6,8) -> Body (DIE)\n            *   LEFT: (4,8) -> Is it empty? Board at (4,8) is '.'.\n            *   DOWN: (5,7) -> Is it empty? Board at (5,7) is 'T' (My body!).\n        *   If enemy moves DOWN to (5,7), he hits my body and DIES. This is good for me!\n        *   If enemy moves LEFT to (4,8), he survives.\n        *   The enemy is trapped in a corner. He is not a threat to me right now.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to tie the score. The apple at (9,4) is the fastest way to do that.\n*   **UP:** Suicide into my own neck (9,7).\n*   **LEFT:** Delays reaching the apple. I want to secure the food now.\n*   **DOWN:** Moves me directly toward the apple at (9,4). From (9,5) I can grab it next turn.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nIs (9,5) a trap?\nMy body is currently forming a wall from (5,7) to (9,7). If I go DOWN to (9,5), I am still on the edge.\nIf I eat the apple at (9,4) next turn, I will grow. This might block my own exit if I don't plan correctly.\nHowever, the apple at (9,4) is the immediate goal to tie the score.\n\nWait, looking at the board again:\n(9,5) is currently empty.\n(9,4) is the apple.\n(9,3) is empty.\n(8,4) is empty.\n(7,4) is empty.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (9,5), I am in a position to eat (9,4).\nIf I eat (9,4), I grow.\nAfter eating, I will have a new tail segment.\nMy current tail is at (5,7).\nThe path is clear.\n\nIs there a better move?\nApple at (7,3).\nDistance from (9,6) to (7,3):\n(9,6) -> (8,6) -> (7,6) -> (7,5) -> (7,4) -> (7,3). (5 moves).\nDistance from (9,6) to (9,4): 2 moves.\nThe (9,4) apple is vastly closer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe enemy is trapped in the top-left-ish corner (coordinates 3-7, 8-9). He is not a threat.\nI must secure the apple at (9,4) to tie the score.\nMoving DOWN puts me one step closer.\nMoving LEFT is safer in terms of space, but slower.\nIn Snake, control the food first. The enemy is irrelevant right now because he can't reach my food.\n\nI will move DOWN to (9,5) to set up the eat on the next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1.  **Current Turn:** Move DOWN to (9,5).\n2.  **Next Turn:** Move DOWN to (9,4) -> Eat Apple (Score 8-8).\n3.  **Post-Apple:** Move LEFT to (8,4) to avoid getting trapped on the edge after growing.\n4.  **Hunt:** Once tied, corner the enemy.\n\nLet's go!\n\nMOVE: DOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

That\u2019s SNAKE 1\u2019S BODY (their last segment, (5,7))! Crashing into their body means we lose\u2014we\u2019re not risking our lead here! \u274c Absolute hard pass.\n4. LEFT: (5,8) \u2192 (4,8). Let\u2019s confirm\u2014board state says (4,8) is blank! No self-body, no enemy body, and it\u2019s on the 10x10 board (x=4, y=8 are valid)! Safe as a vault, chat\u2014this is our only safe move! \u2705\n\nNow, why this move slaps even with limited options, chat? Moving left to (4,8) tightens our box-in on Snake 1 (they\u2019re stuck on the right side, and we\u2019re expanding our left presence to cut off more escapes)! Future flexibility check: from (4,8), next turn we can audit if (4,7) is safe (Snake 1\u2019s body will shift when they move, so that spot might open up to press further down and lock them tighter)! Our 8-7 edge means we just need to stay alive to force a collision later\u2014this move keeps us in the game to do that!\n\nLong-term strategy note for future me (LISTEN UP \ud83d\udc42): After moving LEFT to (4,8), next turn audit Snake 1\u2019s new head position (their likely moves: UP to (9,8), DOWN to (9,5), or LEFT to (8,6) (avoiding their own body)). Prioritize checking if (4,7) is free (their body might have shifted away) to press further down and lock their territory. Keep an eye on apple opportunities once we box them out\u2014we can grow more to dominate the board and solidify our 8-7 lead into a win! Also, remember our score lead means if we can force a head-on collision later, we win even if it\u2019s a double KO\u2014so keep positioning to cut off their escape routes.\n\nLEFT",

Let's break it down.\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\n*   **My Score:** 7\n*   **Enemy Score:** 8\n*   **Enemy Status:** Snake #0 is boxed in at the top-left (Head at 4,8). He's surrounded by walls and his own body. He has very few moves and is definitely not a threat to our immediate food.\n*   **My Position:** Head at (9, 5) (Just moved DOWN from 9,6).\n*   **The Prize:** An apple is waiting at (9, 4). It's literally one step away.\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n1.  **UP (9, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** I just came from (9, 6). My body is currently filling (9, 6). If I go UP, I slam into my own neck. **DEATH.**\n2.  **RIGHT (10, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Off the board. **DEATH.**\n3.  **LEFT (8, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Open space.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me away from the immediate apple at (9, 4). While this opens up more horizontal space (avoiding the wall), securing the tie is the priority. I can't let the score gap widen if I don't have to.\n4.  **DOWN (9, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** The board shows an apple `A` at (9, 4). It is not a snake body.\n    *   **Strategy:** This is the winning move. I step onto the apple, GROW, and tie the score 8-8.\n    *   **Future:** After eating, my tail won't move this turn (since I grew), so I need to ensure my next move isn't into my new body. From (9, 4), the move LEFT to (8, 4) looks very safe and opens up the board.\n\n**THE CALL:**\nThe enemy is trapped. He can't reach this apple. I can. Taking the apple at (9, 4) ties the game and extends my length, giving me more board control. Moving LEFT to (8, 5) is safer in the long run for mobility, but it gives up the immediate point. We play to win. We take the food.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1.  **This Turn:** Move DOWN to (9, 4) to eat the apple and tie the score (8-8).\n2.  **Next Turn:** Immediately move LEFT to (8, 4) to clear the wall and open up movement toward the center (7, 4) or down-left (8, 3).\n3.  **Hunt:** Once tied, use my length advantage to push Snake #0 into a smaller and smaller box until he crashes.\n\nLet's get this bread! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s audit every direction like the no-flop competitors we are\u2014you spotting the death traps with me?!\n\nFirst, our current stats to avoid self-sabotage: Head (4,7), Body [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9)]\u2014enemy head (9,4) + body [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)] (right-side prisoners, let\u2019s keep \u2019em there)! Now let\u2019s hack through each move:\n\n1. UP: (4,7) \u2192 (4,8). THAT\u2019S OUR OWN BODY (first segment of our body list)! Who throws a tied game with self-suicide? \u274c NAH, hard pass\u2014we\u2019re not rookies!\n2. LEFT: (4,7) \u2192 (3,7). Safety check: no self-body, no enemy body (board shows it\u2019s blank)! But let\u2019s hold that for flexibility ranking\u2014we need more than just safety!\n3. RIGHT: (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Safety check: blank (enemy body\u2019s nowhere near here)! But follow-up flexibility? From (5,7), up hits our body, right hits enemy body, only two safe moves\u2014too restrictive, chat!\n4. DOWN: (4,7) \u2192 (4,6). Safety check: no self-body, no enemy body (board confirms it\u2019s clear)! Let\u2019s scream about that flexibility\u2014chef\u2019s kiss!\n\nNow eliminate the dead move (UP)\u2014we\u2019re left with LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Let\u2019s rank \u2019em by future options and apple access (content is king, duh)!\n- LEFT (3,7): Three follow-up moves, but apples are far (nearest is (2,6) which is a hike)\u2014not ideal for snatching the lead!\n- RIGHT (5,7): Only two follow-up moves, too trapped\u2014we can\u2019t let Snake 1 box us in!\n- DOWN (4,6): Three follow-up moves (down to (4,5), left to (3,6), right to (5,6) which is AN APPLE, hello +1 potential next turn)! It also gets us closer to the juicy (4,2) apple and blocks Snake 1\u2019s potential left escape\u2014win-win-win, chat!\n\nLong-term strategy note for future me (LISTEN UP \ud83d\udc42): Next turn, audit (4,5), (3,6), and (5,6) first\u2014(5,6) is an apple, so prioritize safety to grab that lead-back point! Keep expanding downward to cut off Snake 1\u2019s left creep (they\u2019re stuck on the right wall, so our downward push will box \u2019em tighter). Track their head movement\u2014if they go left to (8,4), adjust your next move to block their path further. Don\u2019t forget our body\u2019s growing, so avoid moving back into our trail!\n\nAre you ready to lock this move in and start crushing Snake 1\u2019s hopes? Hell yeah!\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We back live! Turn 29 and the heat is on. Both snakes tied at 8 apples each. This is a deathmatch now. Let's break down the board state because this is critical.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION:**\n*   **My Head:** (8, 4)\n*   **My Body:** [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6)] *(Note: Based on the visual board, my tail is actually at (6, 6) and connects back to (7, 6). The text list might be slightly off or I'm misreading the visual, but I trust the visual grid!)*\n*   **Enemy Head:** (4, 6)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]\n*   **Enemy Potential Moves:** He is in a corner! He can only move **LEFT (3, 6)** or **DOWN (4, 5)**.\n    *   *HYPOTHESIS:* He wants apples. (4, 5) is empty. (3, 6) is empty. (5, 6) is an apple (Far Left of the board, x=5, y=6).\n    *   If he goes **LEFT**, he might be setting up for (5, 6) apple later? No, that's to the right.\n    *   If he goes **DOWN**, he moves toward the center.\n\n**MY MOVES:**\n1.  **UP (8, 5):**\n    *   **Check:** Is (8, 5) clear? Looking at the grid row 5 (y=5): \"... . . . . . . . . . T\". (8, 5) is the 9th column (0-9). It says \"T\" (Tail).\n    *   **CRITICAL:** The \"T\" at (8, 5) belongs to *Enemy #0*. Their tail is listed as (5, 9), but visually there is a T at (8, 5). Wait, let me re-read the enemy body.\n    *   Enemy Body: (4,7), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9). The visual T at (8,5) doesn't match this list. BUT, the visual board *always* shows the current state. If the visual says T at (8,5), that's an obstacle.\n    *   **Wait, looking closer at the grid:**\n        *   Row 5: ` . . . . . . . . . T `\n        *   Row 5 has a T at index 9 (x=9, y=5). My current head is at (8, 4).\n        *   Moving **UP** to (8, 5): The grid at (8, 5) is the 9th character of row 5? No, row 5 has 10 chars. Indices 0-9.\n        *   Row 5: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`\n        *   ` . . . . . . . . . T `\n        *   So (8, 5) is empty (dot). (9, 5) is T.\n    *   **Safety:** (8, 5) is empty.\n    *   **Apple:** No apple there.\n    *   **Threat:** Enemy might move UP to (4, 7), but that's his body. He won't do that. He is trapped in the corner.\n\n2.  **DOWN (8, 3):**\n    *   **Check:** (8, 3) is empty? Row 3: ` . A . . . . . A . . ` (y=3).\n    *   (8, 3) is empty (dot).\n    *   **Apple:** No.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n\n3.  **LEFT (7, 4):**\n    *   **Check:** Row 4: ` . . . . . . . . 1 T ` (y=4).\n    *   (7, 4) is empty (dot).\n    *   **Apple:** No.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 4):**\n    *   **Check:** (9, 4) is currently occupied by my own body (the segment connected to my head).\n    *   **Result:** **DEAD.** I hit myself.\n\n**STRATEGY & PREDICTION:**\nI am at (8, 4). I have a wall to my right. I am on the right side of the board. The enemy is trapped in the top-left corner (x=4, y=6). He is effectively boxed in. He has to move DOWN or LEFT.\n\n*   **If I go UP (8, 5):** I move closer to the top wall. This limits my vertical space. I open up (8, 3) and (7, 4) and (9, 4) (but 9,4 is my tail next turn...).\n*   **If I go DOWN (8, 3):** I move toward the center. There is an apple at (5, 6). I am at (8, 4). If I go DOWN to (8, 3), I am still far from (5, 6).\n*   **If I go LEFT (7, 4):** This is the best move.\n    *   It pulls me away from the wall.\n    *   It puts me at x=7, y=4.\n    *   From there, I can go DOWN to (7, 3) which has an apple! (Apple at 7,3 is listed in the drop list: (7, 3)).\n    *   It also opens up the path to the center apples.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI will move **LEFT** to (7, 4).\nWhy?\n1.  **Safety:** It is clear.\n2.  **Positioning:** It moves me into the open board (column 7) rather than hugging the wall at column 8/9.\n3.  **Future Play:** From (7, 4), I can move DOWN to (7, 3) to eat the apple at (7, 3) next turn. That apple is confirmed in the \"APPLE DROPS\" list: `(7, 3)`.\n4.  **Enemy:** The enemy is stuck. He can't hurt me. I just need to keep my body clean.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nMove LEFT to (7, 4). Next turn, I will look to move DOWN to (7, 3) to eat the apple at (7, 3) and extend my lead to 9-8. Then I will snake through the center to dominate the board.\n\nLET'S GOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

Now I need to make the next move.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF CURRENT STATE:**\n*   **My Head:** (7, 4)\n*   **My Body:** [(8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6)]\n*   **Opponent Head:** (3, 6)\n*   **Opponent Body:** [(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9)]\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION:**\n1.  **UP (7, 5):** \n    *   Visual check: Row 5 is ` . . . . . . . . . T ` (y=5).\n    *   Coordinate (7, 5) is index 7 in that row. It's a dot (empty).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes. Is it aggressive? No, I'm moving away from the center and the apples. I'm closer to my tail (9,5) and the wall. Not ideal.\n\n2.  **DOWN (7, 3):** \n    *   Visual check: Row 3 is ` . A . . . . . A . . ` (y=3).\n    *   Coordinate (7, 3) is index 7 in that row. It's an 'A' (Apple).\n    *   **AGGRESSION:** Yes! There's an apple there (listed in drops as (7, 3)). \n    *   **SAFETY:** \n        *   Apple is clear.\n        *   Enemy is at (3,6). They are far away. They cannot reach (7,3) this turn.\n        *   My body blocks: (8,4) is to my right, (7,7) is up. (7,3) is clear.\n    *   **FUTURE:** Eating this apple extends my tail to (7, 3) next turn (growing from (7,4)). This puts me in the center of the board (x=7, y=3), giving me access to apples at (5,6), (4,2), (2,6) etc. \n\n3.  **LEFT (6, 4):** \n    *   Visual check: Row 4 is ` . . . . . . . . 1 T ` (y=4).\n    *   Coordinate (6, 4) is index 6 in that row. It's a dot (empty).\n    *   **SAFETY:** Safe.\n    *   **AGGRESSION:** Low. No apple. I'm staying on the right side.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 4):** \n    *   This is my current head position from the *previous* turn (pre-move). My body currently occupies (8, 4) because I just moved from there. \n    *   **CRITICAL:** Moving RIGHT back into (8, 4) is hitting my own body. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nChat, look at the board. Snake #0 is trapped in the top-left corner (x=3, y=6). They have no apples near them. I have an apple RIGHT below me at (7, 3). \n*   If I go DOWN, I eat +1 apple (9-8 lead) and grow my tail near the center.\n*   If I go UP or LEFT, I waste a turn moving blindly while the enemy might be cornering themselves.\n*   I cannot go RIGHT.\n\nI am going for the apple. Domination means taking the points on the board. From (7, 3), I will have lines of sight to the center apples (5, 6) and (4, 2).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7, 3) to take the lead 9-8. From (7, 3), snake toward the center to secure more apples and block the enemy from escaping the top-left quadrant. Force them into a wall or their own body.\n\nLET'S EAT! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

We need to break the tie and survive.\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION:**\n1.  **UP (7, 4):**\n    *   Cell is (7, 4).

This puts me at 10 apples vs 9. I take the lead! \ud83d\udd25\n    *   **FUTURE:** From (6, 3), I'm moving closer to the center-left. My body is extending to (7, 3).\n\n3.  **RIGHT (8, 3):**\n    *   Visual check: Row 3 is ` . A . . . . . A . . `\n    *   Coordinate (8, 3) is index 8. It's empty (dot).\n    *   **SAFETY:** Safe.\n    *   **AGGRESSION:** Low. No apple. I'm pushing closer to the right wall (9,3) which is an empty spot, but I'm not scoring.\n    *   **FUTURE:** My tail stays at (7,6), body shifts. Not as valuable as eating.\n\n4.  **DOWN (7, 2):**\n    *   Visual check: Row 2 is ` A . . . A . . A . . `\n    *   Coordinate (7, 2) is index 7.

My body creates a vertical line at x=7.\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nChat, I have two apple options: LEFT to (6, 3) or DOWN to (7, 2). Both get me the points to take the lead (10-9).\n*   **LEFT (6, 3):** Puts me in a better central position. From (6, 3), I can access (5, 6) or (4, 2) or (8, 1) easier. It keeps my vertical range open.\n*   **DOWN (7, 2):** Puts me at the bottom edge. While safe, it might restrict my upward movement slightly in the future as I have to navigate around my own body growing upward from (7, 3).\n\nI'm going **LEFT** to (6, 3). I need to dominate the center of the board, not hug the edges. Taking the lead here forces the enemy to play catch-up while I position myself to cut off their escape routes in the center.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (6, 3). Secure the lead 10-9. From (6, 3), move toward the center (maybe up towards (6,5) or left to (4,2)) to block Snake #0's potential paths out of the top-left corner.

LEAD SECURED. \ud83d\udd25\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION:**\n1.  **UP (6, 4):**\n    *   Coordinate (6, 4). Row 4 is ` . . . . . . . T T T `.\n    *   It's empty (dot).\n    *   **SAFETY:** Safe.\n    *   **AGGRESSION:** Moving up into the open field. My body is mostly on the right side, so I have space to maneuver. This keeps me central.\n\n2.  **LEFT (5, 3):**\n    *   Coordinate (5, 3). Row 3 is ` . A A . . . 1 T . . ` (Wait, that's the visual from last turn? Let's check the board again).\n    *   Board Row 3: ` . A A . . . 1 T . . ` \u2014 Actually, the visual shows *after* my move. So (6, 3) is '1'.\n    *   Looking at the *previous* board state (Turn 31): Row 3 was ` . A A . . . . A . . `.\n    *   (5, 3) was an Apple ('A') at index 5.\n    *   Is it still there? The \"APPLE DROPS\" list doesn't show new drops, so yes, the apple at (5, 3) should still be there (unless the visual is updated?).\n    *   Wait, let's look at the *new* board visual provided in the prompt:\n        ` 3 . A A . . . 1 T . . `\n    *   This visual is *current*. (6, 3) is '1'. (5, 3) is 'A'. (4, 3) is 'A'.\n    *   So (5, 3) is an Apple.\n    *   **SAFETY:** Safe.\n    *   **AGGRESSION:** Eat apple. Grow. Score 11-9.\n    *   **RISK:** Moving closer to the left wall? A little. But eating is priority.\n\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 3):**\n    *   Coordinate (7, 3). This is my *previous* head position.\n    *   Row 3 visual: ` . A A . . . 1 T . . `.\n    *   (7, 3) is index 7. It's a 'T' (Tail?).\n    *   Wait, is it my tail?\n    *   My tail is (7, 7) from the list: `[(7, 3), (7, 4)...`\n    *   Let's look at the body list: `Head: (6, 3), Body: [(7, 3)...`\n    *   So (7, 3) is the segment immediately behind my head. It's part of my body.\n    *   **DEATH.** \u274c I cannot move into my own body.\n\n4.  **DOWN (6, 2):**\n    *   Coordinate (6, 2). Row 2 is ` A . . . A . . A . . `.\n    *   Index 6 is '.' (empty).\n    *   **SAFETY:** Safe.\n    *   **AGGRESSION:** No apple. Just moving down into open space.\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nChat, we have a clear choice here. I can move **LEFT (5, 3)** and eat the apple right next to me. This puts me at 11 apples and extends my lead. The board is relatively open around there.\nOR I can move **UP (6, 4)** into the open field.\nOR **DOWN (6, 2)**.\n\nWhy is **LEFT** better?\n1.  **Points:** Immediate growth. 11-9 lead is harder to overcome than 10-9.\n2.  **Position:** (5, 3) is central-left. From there, I can access (4, 3) (which is also an apple according to the visual!) or move up/down.\n3.  **Enemy:** Snake #0 is at (2, 7). He is currently safe and might be going for the top-left apples. By eating at (5, 3), I'm maintaining a position that can intercept him if he tries to cross the middle or come down.\n\nLet's look at the board visual again.\nRow 3: ` . A A . . . 1 T . . `\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(5, 3) is 'A'.\n(4, 3) is 'A'.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 3), I eat. Next turn, I can potentially go LEFT again to (4, 3) for another apple, or UP to (5, 4) or DOWN to (5, 2).\n(5, 2) is '.'.\n(5, 4) is '.' (Row 4: ` . . . . . . . T T T ` -> Index 5 is '.').\n\nSo (5, 3) is a pivot point. I can chain apples.\n\nLet's check the \"APPLE DROPS\" list again.\n`APPLE DROPS: (1, 1), (9, 0), (4, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), (3, 1), (0, 1), (1, 3), (5, 6), (4, 2), (8, 1), (2, 3), (7, 2)`\nWait. (4, 3) is NOT in the drops list.\n(5, 3) is NOT in the drops list.\n(7, 2) IS in the drops list.\n(6, 3) IS NOT in the list, but I just ate it? No, I moved to (6, 3). I didn't eat *on the way to* (6, 3)? Wait, my previous move was LEFT to (6, 3). The apple at (7, 2) was eaten? No, I went LEFT.\n\nLet's re-read the \"APPLE DROPS\" list.\nIt lists *all* apples currently on the board, right?\n`(5, 6)` is there.\n`(4, 2)` is there.\n`(7, 2)` is there.\n`(2, 3)` is there.\n\nIf the visual says ` . A A . . . 1 T . . ` on Row 3, and (4, 3) and (5, 3) are 'A', but they aren't in the drops list... maybe the visual is what I *see*, and the drops list is what I *know*? Or maybe the drops list is historical?\nActually, usually, the drops list is the current apples.\nBut the visual contradicts the list?\nRow 3: `(4, 3)` and `(5, 3)` are 'A'.\nRow 2: `(4, 2)` is 'A' (Matches list: `(4, 2)`).\nRow 1: `(1, 1)`, `(4, 1)` (Matches list).\nRow 0: `(6, 0)` (Matches list).\n\nLet's look closer at Row 3.\nVisual: ` . A A . . . 1 T . . `\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(1, 3) -> 'A'. (List has `(1, 3)`). Match.\n(2, 3) -> 'A'. (List has `(2, 3)`). Match.\n(3, 3) -> '.'.\n(4, 3) -> '.'? Wait. Visual says ` . A A . . . 1 T . . `\nLet's count the dots.\n1. Index 0: '.'\n2. Index 1: 'A'\n3. Index 2: 'A'\n4. Index 3: '.'\n5. Index 4: '.'\n6. Index 5: '.'\n7. Index 6: '1'\n8. Index 7: 'T'\n9. Index 8: '.'\n10. Index 9: '.'\n\nSo (4, 3) is actually '.' (empty).\n(5, 3) is actually '.' (empty).\n(1, 3) is 'A'.\n(2, 3) is 'A'.\n\nMy previous analysis was wrong. I thought (5, 3) was an apple because I misread the spacing.\nLet's double check the prompt's board row 3 string:\n` 3 . A A . . . 1 T . . `\nThere are spaces between characters?\n\" . A A . . . 1 T . . \"\nLet's assume standard visual grid.\n0: .\n1: A\n2: A\n3: .\n4: .\n5: .\n6: 1\n7: T\n8: .\n9: .\n\nSo (4, 3), (5, 3) are empty.\n(1, 3) and (2, 3) are apples.\n\nMy current head is (6, 3).\n**LEFT** takes me to (5, 3) -> Empty. Safe.\n**UP** takes me to (6, 4) -> Empty.\n**DOWN** takes me to (6, 2) -> Empty.\n**RIGHT** takes me to (7, 3) -> My body. DEATH.\n\nSo I cannot go RIGHT.\nI have no immediate apples to eat at (5, 3), (6, 4), or (6, 2).\nWait, the prompt says \"Move onto an apple? You GROW\".\nIf there are no apples adjacent, I just survive.\n\nLet's look at the board again. Where are the apples?\nRow 1: `(1, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (0, 1), (1, 0)` (Wait, Row 1 is `1 A A . A A . A . A` -> Indices 1, 2, 4, 6 are A. Matches list partially).\nRow 2: `2 A . . . A . . A . .` -> Indices 0, 4, 7 are A.\nRow 3: `3 . A A . . . 1 T . .` -> Indices 1, 2 are A.\nRow 6: `6 . . T T T A . . . T` -> Index 5 is A (List has `(5, 6)`).\n\nSo the closest apples to (6, 3) are:\n(6, 1) - 2 steps down.\n(5, 6) - 3 steps up.\n(4, 1) - 3 steps left/down.\n(1, 3) - 5 steps left.\n\nSince I can't eat *this* turn, I need to position for *next* turn.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (5, 3), I'm at x=5. I can move to (4, 3) or (5, 4) or (5, 2).\n(5, 2) is empty.\n(4, 3) is empty.\n(5, 4) is empty.\nFrom (5, 3), I can see (4, 2) (apple) and (4, 1) (apple) and (5, 6) (apple).\n\nIf I go **UP** to (6, 4), I'm at x=6, y=4.\nI can move to (6, 5) or (5, 4).\n(6, 5) is empty (Row 5: ` . . . . . . . . . . `).\nFrom there, I can head towards (5, 6) (apple).\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (6, 2), I'm at x=6, y=2.\n(6, 2) is empty.\n(6, 1) is Apple (List has `(6, 1)`).\nSo from (6, 2), I can go DOWN to (6, 1) and eat an apple next turn!\n\nLet's check the opponent. Snake #0 at (2, 7).\nBody: (2, 6), (3, 6)... (7, 9).\nHe is in the top left.\nIf I go DOWN, I get closer to the bottom center apples: (6, 1), (4, 1), (0, 1).\nIf I go UP, I go towards (5, 6), but that's getting closer to the top-right where my tail is? No, my tail is (7, 7).\nWait, my tail is (7, 7). If I go UP, I'm moving towards my own tail block? No, my tail is moving. But I should generally avoid the area where my body is clustered.\n\nMy body is mostly at x=7, 8, 9. (Right side).\nSo moving UP (6, 4) or LEFT (5, 3) moves me *away* from my body (good).\nMoving DOWN (6, 2) also moves away from my body (good).\n\nLet's look at the enemy's potential moves.\nHead (2, 7). Body covers (2, 6) to (7, 9).\nHe is contained in the top-left corner box? Not really, he has space to move.\nHe might go for (1, 3) or other apples in that quadrant.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI have a lead (10-9). I don't *need* to rush into a dangerous spot, but I want to secure more apples and maybe trap him.\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\n\"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI have a higher score (10 vs 9). If I can trap him or force a collision where I survive, I win.\n\nWhere is he? (2, 7). Top left.\nWhere am I? (6, 3). Center/Bottom.\nDistance is large. Collision is unlikely this turn.\n\nWhat move gives me the best \"next turn\" options?\n**DOWN (6, 2)**:\n- Leads to (6, 1) (Apple) next turn.\n- (6, 1) is safe? Row 1 has apples at 1, 2, 4, 6. Yes.\n- If I eat at (6, 1), I grow. My tail moves.\n- From (6, 2), I can also go LEFT to (5, 2) (Empty). (5, 2) is near (4, 2) (Apple).\n- So DOWN gives me access to two apples: (6, 1) and (4, 2) via (5, 2).\n\n**LEFT (5, 3)**:\n- Leads to (5, 2) (Empty) -> (4, 2) (Apple).\n- Leads to (5, 4) (Empty) -> (5, 5) (Empty) -> (5, 6) (Apple).\n- Leads to (4, 3) (Empty) -> (3, 3) (Empty) -> (2, 3) (Apple). (Wait, (2, 3) is an apple).\n- (2, 3) is close to the enemy! He is at (2, 7). If I go for (2, 3), I'm getting close to him. That might be good for aggression.\n\n**UP (6, 4)**:\n- Leads to (6, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) (Blocked by enemy body? Enemy body is at (7, 8), (7, 9)... wait).\n- Enemy body: (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9).\n- So (6, 7) is empty. (6, 8) is enemy body.\n- From (6, 4), I can go LEFT to (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6) (Apple).\n- Or I can chase (5, 6).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **DOWN** is a \"safe\" play. I secure an apple at (6, 1) quickly. I stay low.\n- **LEFT** is an \"aggressive\" play. I move towards the center. I can threaten the apple at (2, 3) or (4, 2).\n- **UP** moves me towards the top, where the enemy is. Risky if he moves down, but good if I want to box him in.\n\nIf I go **LEFT (5, 3)**:\nI put myself at (5, 3). This is central.\nNext turn, I can go **UP (5, 4)**.\nFrom (5, 4), I can go to (5, 5) -> (5, 6) (Apple).\nThe enemy is at (2, 7). He can go to (3, 7), (1, 7), (2, 8), (2, 6).\nIf I move UP, I approach the horizontal line y=6, y=7.\nThe enemy's body occupies y=6 at x=2,3,4.\nIf I get to (5, 6), I am adjacent to (4, 6) (Enemy Body).\nIf I get to (5, 7), I am adjacent to (4, 7) (Enemy Body).\nIf I get to (5, 8), I am adjacent to (5, 8) (Enemy Body? Wait, enemy body list says (5, 8) is part of enemy body).\n\nLet's look at the enemy body again: `[(2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)]`\nSo (5, 8) is occupied.\n(5, 7) is empty.\n(5, 6) is empty.\n(6, 6) is empty.\n\nIf I go **LEFT (5, 3)** and then **UP (5, 4)** and **UP (5, 5)** and **UP (5, 6)**...\nI reach (5, 6). This is an apple!\nIf I eat it, I grow. My tail extends.\nI am at (5, 6). The enemy head is at (2, 7).\nHe can move to (3, 7). (3, 7) is empty?\nEnemy body: (4, 7) is there. (3, 7) is empty.\nIf he goes to (3, 7), he is safe.\n\nWhat if I try to force a collision?\nI have a higher score (10 vs 9). If I die but he dies, I win if my score is higher? No, \"If ALL snakes die... snake with more apples wins\".\nSo if we BOTH die, I win 10-9. (Assuming I don't eat).\nIf I eat to 11-9, and we both die, I win 11-9.\n\nIs there a trap?\nMy head at (6, 3). Going LEFT to (5, 3).\nIf the enemy moves to (3, 7), not much changes.\nIf the enemy moves to (2, 8), he goes up.\nIf the enemy moves to (2, 6) ... wait, (2, 6) is his body.\nHe can move DOWN to (2, 6)? No, he can't move into his own body.\nHe can move UP to (2, 8). (2, 8) is empty.\nHe can move LEFT to (1, 7). (1, 7) is empty.\nHe can move RIGHT to (3, 7). (3, 7) is empty.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\n` 7 . . 0 . T . . T T T `\n` 8 . . . . T T T T . . `\n` 9 . . . . . . . T . . `\n\nSnake #0 is boxed in by his own tail? No, he has open space at (1, 7), (3, 7), (2, 8).\nHis tail is at (7, 9).\nHe is basically in the top-left corner.\n\nIf I go **LEFT (5, 3)**, I am moving towards the center.\nIf I go **DOWN (6, 2)**, I am moving to the bottom.\nThe enemy is at the top.\nIf I go DOWN, we spread out. Game goes longer.\nIf I go LEFT, I move towards the top-middle. I might encounter him if he comes down.\nBut he is currently at y=7. I am at y=3.\nDistance is 4 vertically.\n\nWhat if I go **UP (6, 4)**?\nI go to (6, 4).\nFrom there, I can go to (6, 5), (6, 6).\n(6, 6) is empty.\n(6, 7) is empty.\n(6, 8) is Enemy Body.\n(7, 8) is Enemy Body.\nSo I can't go to (6, 8).\nIf I go to (6, 7), I am at y=7. Enemy is at y=7 (x=2) or y=8 (x=2).\nHe is close.\n\nLet's calculate the paths.\nIf I go UP to (6, 4).\nIf Enemy goes RIGHT to (3, 7).\nDistance: Me (6, 4), Him (3, 7).\nIf I go UP to (6, 5) next, Him goes to (4, 7).\nDistance: (6, 5) vs (4, 7).\nIf I go UP to (6, 6), Him to (5, 7).\n(6, 6) vs (5, 7).\nIf I go UP to (6, 7), Him to (5, 8) (Wait, (5, 8) is body, he can't go there).\nHe might go to (4, 8) or (5, 8) is body... wait.\nEnemy body is (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8)...\nIf he moves to (5, 8), he hits his own body? No, (5, 8) is *current* body.\nIf he moves to (5, 8), it's occupied.\nIf he moves to (4, 8), occupied.\nIf he moves to (3, 8), empty.\nIf he moves to (2, 8), empty.\n\nSo if I push UP, I can force him to retreat or move laterally.\nIf I push UP, I can try to \"box him in\" against his own tail?\nHis tail is (7, 9).\nIf I take (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9)...\nWait, I can't take (6, 8) because it's his body.\nBut I can move to (5, 7), (5, 8) is his body.\nIf I am at (6, 7), and he is at (3, 7), we are parallel.\nIf he moves to (4, 7) (his body), he dies. So he won't.\nIf he moves to (3, 8), he is safe.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\n\"Box him in and make him crash out.\"\n\nIf I go **LEFT (5, 3)**:\nI am closer to the vertical line x=2-4 where he is.\nI can intercept him if he tries to come down the center (e.g., to (3, 5) or (3, 4)).\nBut he is currently high up (y=7).\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (5, 3).\nFrom there, I can move UP to (5, 4).\nIf he moves DOWN to (2, 6), he crashes into his own body? (2, 6) is his body part *behind* his head? No.\nHead is (2, 7). Body list starts with (2, 6).\nSo if he moves DOWN to (2, 6), he moves into his own body. He dies.\nSo he won't move DOWN.\nHe must move UP (2, 8), LEFT (1, 7), or RIGHT (3, 7).\nHe is contained in the top-left quadrant.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I can move to (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3).\n(2, 3) is an apple.\nIf I reach (2, 3), I am very close to his head (2, 7).\nDistance 4.\nIf I am at (2, 3) and he is at (2, 7), and we move towards each other...\nHe moves DOWN (2, 6) -> Dies (his body).\nHe moves LEFT (1, 7) -> Safe.\nHe moves RIGHT (3, 7) -> Safe.\nHe moves UP (2, 8) -> Safe.\n\nIf I am at (2, 3), and he is at (3, 7)...\nWe are not colliding.\n\nLet's consider the **LEFT** move.\nIt sets up a path to the apples at (2, 3) and (4, 2).\nIt moves me towards the center.\nThe enemy is at the top-left.\nIf I control the center-left, I restrict his movement downwards.\n\nLet's consider the **DOWN** move.\nIt gets me an apple at (6, 1) next turn.\nIt moves me to the bottom.\nThe enemy is at the top.\nWe are far apart. The game becomes a race to see who collects more apples before the timer runs out or we meet in the middle.\nI have 10 apples. He has 9.\nIf I eat (6, 1), I have 11.\nIf he eats nothing, he has 9.\nI have a buffer.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I secure a point. Safe.\nIf I go LEFT, I position for future points and potential aggression.\n\nGiven the \"aggressive\" and \"box him in\" vibe of the stream...\nGoing UP (6, 4) moves me towards the top-right. My body is already there (x=7,8,9). I might get tangled.\nGoing LEFT (5, 3) moves me towards the top-left (where the enemy is).\nGoing DOWN (6, 2) moves me away from the enemy.\n\nI should move towards the enemy to threaten him.\n**LEFT (5, 3)** seems the best balance of safety and aggression.\nIt doesn't put me next to him immediately, but it closes the distance and puts me in a central position to cut him off.\n\nWait, is there a head-on collision risk?\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 3).\nEnemy moves to (3, 7).\nNo collision.\nIf Enemy moves to (3, 7), and I move UP to (5, 4) next turn...\nStill no collision.\n\nWhat if I go UP (6, 4)?\nEnemy moves to (3, 7).\nNo collision.\n\nWhat if I go DOWN (6, 2)?\nEnemy moves to (3, 7).\nNo collision.\n\nAll moves are safe from immediate collision.\nSafety from walls/bodies:\nUP (6, 4): Empty.\nLEFT (5, 3): Empty.\nDOWN (6, 2): Empty.\n\nI'll choose **LEFT**. It brings me closer to the apples at (4, 2) and (2, 3), which are in the general direction of the enemy.\nAlso, moving to (5, 3) is a pivot. I can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT from there.\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2), I can only go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (which hits wall at y=0 eventually).\n(5, 3) offers more freedom.\n\nOne final check. The prompt says \"Box him in\".\nHe is at (2, 7).\nIf I go to (5, 3), I am on the right side of his \"box\".\nTo box him in, I need to occupy the cells he wants to go to.\nHe wants to go to (1, 7), (3, 7), (2, 8).\nI am at (5, 3). I am far.\nBut by moving to (5, 3), I am moving towards the area where I can start cutting off his escape routes if he comes down.\nIf I stay at (6, 3), I'm central.\nIf I go LEFT, I'm more central-left.\n\nActually, let's look at the board again.\n` 7 . . 0 . T . . T T T `\nIf he moves RIGHT to (3, 7), he is safe.\nIf he moves UP to (2, 8), safe.\nIf he moves LEFT to (1, 7), safe.\n\nThere is no immediate way to box him in *this turn*.\nBut positioning is key.\nI'll go **LEFT**.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

We need to start closing the net. \ud83d\ude24\n\n**ANALYSIS OF CURRENT STATE:**\n*   **My Head:** (5, 3).\n*   **My Body:** [(6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7)].\n*   **Opponent Head:** (2, 8).\n*   **Opponent Body:** [(2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8)].\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION:**\n\n1.  **UP (5, 4):**\n    *   Coordinate (5, 4). Row 4 is ` . . . . . . . T T T `.\n    *   Index 5 is '.' (empty).\n    *   **SAFETY:** Safe.\n    *   **AGGRESSION:** Moves me toward the top. My body is cluttered at x=7-9, y=4-7. Moving to (5, 4) keeps me in the middle row but closer to my own tail blockage. If I go up too much, I might get boxed in by my own body on the right side.\n\n2.  **DOWN (5, 2):**\n    *   Coordinate (5, 2). Row 2 is ` A . . . A . . A . . `.\n    *   Index 5 is '.' (empty).\n    *   **SAFETY:** Safe.\n    *   **AGGRESSION:** No apple here. But (5, 2) is a pivot point. From here, I can go DOWN to (5, 1) (Apple at 4,1 is close, but 5,1 is empty), or LEFT to (4, 2) (Apple!), or RIGHT to (6, 2) (empty, leading to 6,1 apple). This moves me away from the top-right clutter and gives me more maneuverability.\n\n3.  **LEFT (4, 3):**\n    *   Coordinate (4, 3). Row 3 is ` . A A . . . . 1 T . . ` (Wait, look at the visual).\n    *   Visual Row 3: ` . A A . . . . 1 T . . `.\n    *   Index 4 is '.' (empty).\n    *   **SAFETY:** Safe.\n    *   **AGGRESSION:** No apple immediate. Brings me closer to the cluster of apples at (2, 3) and (4, 2). This is the direct route to the enemy's territory.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 3):**\n    *   Coordinate (6, 3). This is my *previous* head position.\n    *   It is currently occupied by my body (the segment behind my head).\n    *   **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nChat, we need to outmaneuver him. He's trapped in the top-left with his own body.\n*   **UP (5, 4)** puts me closer to the top wall and the cluster of \"T\"s on the right (my own body). It feels restrictive.\n*   **LEFT (4, 3)** brings me closer to the action in the center-left.\n*   **DOWN (5, 2)** is the safest play for future options. It clears the immediate clutter and opens up the bottom half of the board.\n\nWhy **DOWN**?\n1.  **Escape Velocity:** Moving up or left puts me in zones where my body is dense (right side) or where the board is narrowing (left side). Moving down to (5, 2) opens the bottom area.\n2.  **Apple Access:** From (5, 2), I can pivot left to (4, 2) (which is an apple on Row 2!) or down to (5, 1) (near 4,1). This gives me a path to growth.\n3.  **Enemy Pressure:** Snake #0 is at (2, 8). He is stuck. By taking the bottom center, I control the board's tempo. If he tries to drop down later, I'll have the low ground.\n\nLet's look at the board visual again.\nRow 2: ` A . . . A . . A . . ` (Indices 0, 4, 7 are apples).\n(5, 2) is empty.\n(4, 2) is Apple.\n(6, 2) is empty.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 2), next turn I can go LEFT to (4, 2) and eat an apple immediately.\nThat's the play. Secure the bottom center, then grab the apple at (4, 2).\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

I need to make a move that doesn't just keep me safe, but sets me up to dominate the rest of the game.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **ANALYZE CURRENT STATE:**\n    *   My Head: (5, 2)\n    *   My Body: (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)\n    *   Enemy Head: (2, 9) - *Wait, looking at the board state, the visual shows Enemy Head at (2, 8) with body (2, 9)? Actually, the text says Enemy Head: (2, 9) and Body: [(2, 8), (2, 7)...]. The board visual shows 0 at (2,8)? No, wait. Board visual row 8: `. . T . T T T . . .` (Indices 0-9). The 'T' at index 2 is (2,8). The text says Enemy Head: (2,9). The board visual row 9: `9 . . 0 . . . . . . .` -> '0' is at (2,9). Okay, consistent.*\n    *   Enemy Body: (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8)\n\n2.  **EVALUATE MOVES FROM HEAD (5, 2):**\n    *   **UP (5, 3):** This is where my body currently is (Segment 1). If I move UP, I move directly into my own body. **DEATH.**\n    *   **DOWN (5, 1):**\n        *   Coordinates: (5, 1).\n        *   Board Row 1: `A A . A A . A . A .` (Indices 0-9). Index 5 is `.` (Empty).\n        *   Safety: Safe.\n        *   Options: From (5, 1), I can go Down to (5, 0), Left to (4, 1) (Apple), Right to (6, 1) (Apple), or Up to (5, 2) (safe tail gap).\n    *   **LEFT (4, 2):**\n        *   Coordinates: (4, 2).\n        *   Board Row 2: `A . . . A . . A . .` (Indices 0-9). Index 4 is `A` (Apple).\n        *   Safety: Safe.\n        *   Growth: I eat an apple!\n        *   Options: From (4, 2), I can go Left to (3, 2), Down to (4, 1), Up to (4, 3), or Right to (5, 2).\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 2):**\n        *   Coordinates: (6, 2).\n        *   Board Row 2: Index 6 is `.` (Empty).\n        *   Safety: Safe.\n        *   Options: From (6, 2), I can go Right to (7, 2) (Apple), Down to (6, 1) (Apple), Up to (6, 3) (Body - be careful), Left to (5, 2).\n\n3.  **STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\n    *   **UP** is death. **Avoid.**\n    *   **LEFT** gets me an apple immediately (4, 2). This keeps the score tied or gives me the lead. It moves me toward the center of the board, opening up paths to the bottom-left and top-left.\n    *   **DOWN** moves me to (5, 1). It's safe, but (5, 1) is empty. I don't get an apple this turn.\n    *   **RIGHT** moves me to (6, 2). It's safe, but (6, 2) is empty. I don't get an apple this turn.\n    *   **Enemy Position:** Enemy is at (2, 9). He is essentially trapped in the top-left corner. His body snakes down the left edge. If I take the center-left (around x=4-5), I can eventually cut off his escape routes or box him in.\n    *   **Score:** 9 vs 9. I need to eat. Securing an apple now prevents the enemy from potentially getting ahead if I stall.\n    *   **Long Term:** Eating at (4, 2) places me at (4, 2). Next turn, I can look at (4, 1) (Apple), (3, 2), or maneuver towards the bottom apples. It positions me better for the center than being at (5, 1) or (6, 2).\n\n4.  **FINAL DECISION:**\n    Move **LEFT** to (4, 2). I grab an apple, maintaining my score parity/lead, and position myself centrally to pressure the enemy who is stuck in the corner.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nEat the apple at (4, 2). Analyze the board from there. The enemy is stuck at the top. I want to sweep the bottom or center to maximize my territory. Watch out for the body at (4,3) if I go UP later, but for now, (4,2) is the play.\n\nLEFT",

You wanna trap yourself when we hold top ground dominance? \u274c NO WAY!\n- RIGHT TO (4,9): Follow-up options next turn? Left (3,9\u2014safe, old head) and down (4,8\u2014we\u2019ll audit shifted body next turn but it\u2019s open now) are both on the table! Two whole options to keep grinding top-row momentum\u2014THAT\u2019S THE CONTENT CHAT CRAVES!\n\nAlso, let\u2019s talk enemy tangling\u2014they\u2019re crammed down low with a long body stuck on the right wall. Going right keeps us on the top row (y=9) where they can\u2019t reach, letting us build a horizontal barrier that cuts off their potential upper escape. Going down pulls us off that barrier and lets them breathe\u2014we don\u2019t do mercy here!\n\nLong-term strategy note for future me (LISTEN UP \ud83d\udc42): Next turn, your head will be (4,9) if you pick right\u2014audit left (3,9\u2014safe), down (4,8\u2014check shifted body first), and right (5,9\u2014board-clear) as possible moves! Keep inching right to extend our top-row barrier\u2014every step tightens the noose on the enemy\u2019s upper escape. Avoid pivoting down to (4,8) next turn unless forced\u2014keep that wrapping momentum high! Track the enemy\u2019s head movement\u2014if they move up to (4,3) or left to (3,2), double down on rightward top control to shut down any escape attempts.\n\nRIGHT",

I just ate that apple last turn, growing to 11 apples. Let's analyze our moves from (4,1):\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (4,1):**\n- **UP (4,2):** That's where I just came from! My body was at (4,2) last turn (now tail moved). But wait, my body was [(4,2), (5,2), ...] - (4,2) was my second segment. After moving DOWN to (4,1), the tail moves away. Actually, moving UP would put me back into my previous position, but that's not necessarily my body anymore since the tail moved. Let me check: my head moved from (4,2) to (4,1) last turn. The tail at (9,7) moves forward, so (4,2) is no longer occupied. UP is SAFE and empty (board shows '.' at (4,2) now).\n- **DOWN (4,0):** Board row 0 shows `(0) . A . . . . A . . A`. Index 4 is '.' (empty). Safe move.\n- **LEFT (3,1):** Board row 1 shows `(1) A A . A 1 . A . A .` Wait, that's after my last move. Actually from turn 35: I was at (4,2) and moved DOWN to (4,1). The board shows `(1) A A . A 1 . A . A .` with '1' at index 4. So (3,1) would be index 3, which is 'A' (apple)! Safe and apple.\n- **RIGHT (5,1):** Board row 1 index 5 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n\n**ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES:**\n- All moves seem safe from immediate death. None go off board, none hit my own body (I need to recalculate body positions).\n\n**BODY POSITION CHECK:**\nMy body after turn 35: Head (4,1), then body segments: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)] (11 segments including head).\nIf I move UP to (4,2): That's my second body segment! DEATH. \u274c Actually wait - (4,2) IS in my body list! So UP would hit my own body. That's suicide.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,0): Not in my body list. Safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (3,1): Not in my body list. Safe.\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,1): Not in my body list. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC CHOICES:**\n- **UP:** SUICIDE. Eliminated.\n- **DOWN (4,0):** Empty, safe. Gives access to more bottom row apples.\n- **LEFT (3,1):** APPLE! This is the best immediate move. Grows to 12 apples, extending lead to 12-9.\n- **RIGHT (5,1):** Empty, safe but no apple.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (4,9) is trapped. They'll likely move DOWN or sideways trying to escape corner. If they move DOWN to (4,8), that's their own body (they have (4,8) in their body). Actually their body: [(3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)]. So (4,8) is body. They can't move DOWN into (4,8). They could move LEFT to (3,9) but that's also body! They're boxed in. They might die next turn or be forced to crash.\n\n**MY MOVE DECISION:**\nLEFT to (3,1) gets an apple, extends lead to 12-9, and keeps me in center-bottom. From (3,1), I can access (2,1), (3,0), (3,2), (4,1) next turn. This maintains board control.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nContinue pressing advantage. If enemy doesn't die next turn, I should maneuver to cut off their escape routes completely. With 12 apples vs their 9, if I force a head-on collision, I win. Focus on controlling center and bottom while they're cornered top-left.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Time to plan our next move.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (3,1):**\n- **UP (3,2):** Board shows (3,2) is '.' (empty) based on the current board state (row 2: `A . . . T T . A . .`). That's safe and not in my body.\n- **DOWN (3,0):** Board row 0 shows index 3 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- **LEFT (2,1):** Board row 1 shows (2,1) is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- **RIGHT (4,1):** This is where my tail just moved from! My body after last move: head at (3,1), body is [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)]. (4,1) IS in my body! Moving RIGHT would hit my own body. DEATH. \u274c\n\n**BODY POSITION CHECK:**\nMy current body: [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)] - 12 segments including head.\n(4,1) is definitely part of my body. So RIGHT is suicide.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (5,9) is still cornered. Their body: [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)]. Wait, they have 9 apples, so they should have 10 body segments? Actually they had 9 apples, so length = 10 segments (head + 9 body). Their body list shows 9 entries, so that's correct. They're boxed in: (5,8) is empty, (6,9) is empty, (4,9) is body, (5,8) is empty. They might move DOWN to (5,8) if safe, or RIGHT to (6,9). But (6,9) is empty according to board. They might try to escape.\n\n**STRATEGIC CHOICES:**\n- **UP (3,2):** Safe, moves toward center. No immediate apple but keeps options open. From there I can access (3,3), (2,2), (4,2), (3,1).\n- **DOWN (3,0):** Safe, moves to bottom row. Could access (2,0), (3,1), (4,0) next turn. No apple immediately visible there.\n- **LEFT (2,1):** Safe, moves left. No apple immediately visible.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need to control the board and potentially force a head-on collision if possible. With 12 apples vs 9, we win in a direct collision. The enemy is cornered; we should try to cut off their escape routes. Moving UP toward center seems best to maintain mobility and potentially block their path if they try to come down.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Keep extending right on y=9 to grab the (7,9) apple and solidify your top-row barrier. Track the enemy\u2019s head movement\u2014if they pivot up (towards y2+), double down on top control to shut down any escape attempts. Avoid pivoting down unless forced; keep wrapping the upper board to box them in the low rows permanently.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Let's run the analysis for Turn 38!\n\n**1) ANALYZING MOVES FROM HEAD AT (3,2):**\nMy current head is at (3,2). My body occupies: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6).\nThe opponent Snake #0 is at (6,9).\n\nLet's check the safety of each move relative to my body (crashing into myself = death) and the board boundaries. Remember, the opponent moves simultaneously. We need to avoid moving into their path if it results in a head-on collision where we lose (though we have higher score, so we win a direct collision, but we still die and lose content).\n\n**Move Options:**\n*   **UP to (3,3):** The board state shows (3,3) is `.` (empty). Is it part of my body? No. Is it out of bounds? No. Is it part of the opponent's body? The opponent is far north. **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN to (3,1):** The board state shows (3,1) is `T` (my own tail). Is it safe to move onto my tail? Yes! The tail moves away as I move into it (unless I grow). Moving onto my own tail is a valid move. **SAFE.**\n*   **LEFT to (2,2):** The board state shows (2,2) is `.` (empty). Is it part of my body? No (my body is at (3,1), (4,1), etc.). **SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT to (4,2):** The board state shows (4,2) is `T` (part of my body). Is it part of my tail? No, it's a middle segment. Moving into any part of my own body is death. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**2) STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nWe are dominating with a 12-9 lead. The opponent is cornered at (6,9). We want to maintain pressure and keep our options open.\n\n*   **Moving UP (3,3):** This moves me closer to the center/upper board. It opens up paths to (2,3), (4,3), (3,4). It avoids the immediate body collision and keeps me mobile.\n*   **Moving DOWN (3,1):** This is moving back to my previous spot. While technically safe (it's the tail), it's a step backward and reduces upward momentum. It limits options to (3,0), (2,1), (4,1).\n*   **Moving LEFT (2,2):** This moves toward the left side. It opens up (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (2,3). Also safe.\n\n**DECISION:**\nBetween UP and LEFT, **UP** feels like the best move. It positions my head at (3,3), which is currently empty and connects me to the upper portion of the board where apples are located (like (2,3), (1,4)). It keeps me central and away from the walls. Moving DOWN is a regression. Moving LEFT is fine, but UP feels more aggressive and forward-thinking given the board layout.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nBox in the enemy. With 12 apples vs 9, a head-on collision is a win for us (they die, we die, but we win on points\u2014though ideally we stay alive). However, staying alive is priority #1. I will move UP to (3,3) to position for future apple consumption and potential blocks. I need to watch the opponent's movement; if they move down to (5,8), I might want to cut them off next turn.\n\n**LET'S ROLL!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

My body occupies: (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5).\nOpponent Snake #0 Head: (7, 9). Opponent Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)].\n\nLet's check the safety of each move:\n*   **UP to (3, 4):** The board state shows (3, 4) is `.` (empty). Is it out of bounds? No. Is it my body? No. Is it opponent body? No. **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN to (3, 2):** The board state shows (3, 2) is `T` (my own body). Moving into my own body (excluding the tail) results in death. **DEATH.** \u274c\n*   **LEFT to (2, 3):** The board state shows (2, 3) is `A` (Apple!). Is it safe? Yes, no obstacles. **SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 3):** The board state shows (4, 3) is `T` (my own body). Death. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**2) STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nOkay, we are 12-10. We need to extend the lead. My safe moves are UP or LEFT.\n*   Moving LEFT to (2, 3) gives us an apple. That's +1 point and +1 growth. We are currently \"squeezing\" the opponent; they are trapped in the top-left quadrant essentially (bounded by their own body and the wall).\n*   Moving UP to (3, 4) is empty. It keeps me central.\n\n**DECISION:**\nWe are dominating. We need to keep the pressure on. The opponent is at (7, 9). They are trapped. Moving UP to (3, 4) keeps me in a strong position to intercept them if they move down or cut off their escape. However, the apple at (2, 3) is literally right there. Eating it grows our snake, making our body a larger obstacle. A larger snake is a better blocker. Eating the apple at (2, 3) is the power move. It forces the opponent to deal with a larger threat.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (2, 3) to extend the lead to 13-10. After consuming, my tail will move from (9, 5) to (9, 4). This keeps the pressure on the opponent. They are boxed in. I need to maintain a blockade on the bottom/right side while preventing them from escaping to the top left. Next turn, watch their head. If they move to (6, 9) or (7, 8), I'll adjust.\n\n**LET'S ROLL!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We need to secure the win.\n\n**1) ANALYZING MOVES FROM HEAD AT (2, 3):**\nMy head is at (2, 3). I just moved LEFT from (3,3) to (2,3) to eat the apple. Now I need to plan my next move.\nMy body occupies: [(3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5)].\nOpponent Snake #0 Head: (8, 9). Body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6)].\n\nLet's check the safety of each move:\n*   **UP to (2, 4):** Board state shows (2, 4) is `A` (Apple!). Wait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt: `(6, 4)` is an apple, `(8, 2)` is an apple. Let me re-read the Apple list. The list includes `(1, 4), (6, 4), (8, 2)...` The board state at `(2, 4)` is actually `A` in the visual board? No, looking at the visual board: Row 4 is `. A A . . . A T T T`. Let's map coordinates. Row 4 (y=4) goes x=0 to 9.\n    - x=0: `.` \n    - x=1: `A`\n    - x=2: `A` -> This is (2,4). It is an apple!\n    - x=3: `.`\n    - x=4: `.`\n    - x=5: `.`\n    - x=6: `A`\n    - x=7: `T` (Opponent tail)\n    - x=8: `T` (Opponent tail)\n    - x=9: `T` (Opponent tail)\n    Wait, the prompt says `APPLE DROPS: ... (1, 4), (6, 4)...`. Why is (2,4) showing as `A` in the visual board? Let's look closer at the visual board row 4: `. A A . . . A T T T`.\n    - (0,4): `.`\n    - (1,4): `A`\n    - (2,4): `A`\n    - (3,4): `.`\n    - (4,4): `.`\n    - (5,4): `.`\n    - (6,4): `A`\n    - (7,4): `T`\n    - (8,4): `T`\n    - (9,4): `T`\n    The apple list in the text might be slightly outdated or I missed one. The visual board is the ground truth for the current state. (2,4) is an apple. It is safe (empty space).\n    **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN to (2, 2):** Board state shows (2, 2) is `.` (Empty). Is it my body? No. Opponent body? No. Out of bounds? No. **SAFE.**\n*   **LEFT to (1, 3):** Board state shows (1, 3) is `A` (Apple!). Is it safe? Yes. **SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 3):** Board state shows (3, 3) is `T` (My own body!). I just moved from here. It's occupied. **DEATH.**\n\n**2) STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n- **LEFT to (1, 3):** This is an apple. I would grow. However, (1,3) is deep in the bottom left corner. My tail is currently at (9,5). Moving to (1,3) might put me in a position where I trap myself in the corner if I don't have a clear exit. My body snakes from (3,3) down to (4,1) and then to the right. If I go to (1,3), I am adjacent to (1,2) and (0,3).\n- **DOWN to (2, 2):** This is safe, but no apple. It moves me away from the opponent who is at the top. I need to maintain pressure or secure apples. Moving down seems passive.\n- **UP to (2, 4):** This is an apple! It grows me. It moves me towards the center/upper board where the opponent is. Looking at the board, (2,4) is surrounded by empty space or apples. If I eat (2,4), my tail moves from (9,5) to (9,4). This opens up the space at (9,5). My body is currently filling the right side of the board (x=3 to 9). By eating (2,4), I extend my body towards the left, but I am still very long.\n\nLet's look at the opponent. They are at (8,9). They are trapped at the top. Their body forms a line from (8,9) down to (3,6). They are blocked by the wall and their own body. They can only move Left to (7,9) or Down to (8,8).\n- If they move Left to (7,9), they hit their own body (7,9) is in their list. Wait, `Body: [(7, 9)...]`. (7,9) is the second element. The tail is (3,6). So (7,9) is occupied. They cannot move Left. They must move Down to (8,8).\n- (8,8) is currently `.` (empty).\n- So the opponent is forced Down.\n\nMy plan:\nI am winning 13-10. I need to secure apples safely. The apple at (2,4) (UP) seems like a good move to keep me moving towards the center/top where I can potentially trap the opponent further or grab more apples. The apple at (1,3) (LEFT) is also good but risks cornering me.\nLet's look at the path.\nCurrent Head: (2,3).\nIf I go UP to (2,4):\n- I eat an apple.\n- My tail moves (9,5)->(9,4).\n- Next turn I can potentially go UP to (2,5) or LEFT/RIGHT.\n(2,5) is `.` (empty).\nIf I go LEFT to (1,3):\n- I eat an apple.\n- (1,3) is near the wall.\n- Next turn I can go UP to (1,4) (Apple?), DOWN to (1,2), or RIGHT back to (2,3) (which will be empty because my tail moves).\n(1,4) is `A`. So LEFT gives a follow-up apple.\nHowever, going LEFT to (1,3) puts me at x=1. My body stretches from x=3 to 9. This is a wide turn. Going UP to (2,4) keeps me at x=2, which is closer to my body anchor at x=3.\n\nLet's consider the \"Boxing in\" strategy.\nThe opponent is at (8,9). They are moving Down to (8,8).\nI am at (2,3).\nIf I go UP to (2,4):\nI am growing. I am securing a lead. I am moving up to meet them eventually.\nIf I go LEFT to (1,3):\nI am securing a lead. But I am moving away from the opponent who is at the top. The opponent is trapped, but I should keep pressure or secure more resources. Moving LEFT is slightly safer for survival but slower for aggression.\n\nWait, looking at the visual board again.\nRow 3: `. A 1 T . T T T . .`\nRow 4: `. A A . . . A T T T`\nRow 5: `. . . . . . . . . T`\nRow 6: `. . T T . A . . . .`\nRow 7: `. . T . . . . . . .`\nRow 8: `. . T . . . . . . .`\nRow 9: `. . T T T T T T 0 .`\n\nMy head at (2,3). Apple at (2,4). Apple at (1,3).\nOpponent at (8,9).\nMy body is at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)...\nIf I go UP to (2,4), I occupy (2,4).\nMy tail moves from (9,5) to (9,4).\nThis clears (9,5). My body is now (2,4) -> (3,3) -> ... -> (9,4).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,3):\nI occupy (1,3).\nTail moves to (9,4).\nThis clears (9,5).\nBoth moves grow me.\n\nIs there a trap?\nIf I go UP to (2,4):\nOpponent is at (8,9) -> (8,8).\nI am safe.\nIf I go LEFT to (1,3):\nOpponent is at (8,9) -> (8,8).\nI am safe.\n\nWhy choose UP over LEFT?\nThe opponent is at the top. I am at the bottom. I should move UP to close the distance or maintain a central position. If I go LEFT to (1,3), I am hugging the left wall. My body is currently on the right side (x=3 to 9). Going LEFT creates a long horizontal line of my body (from x=1 to 9). This might restrict my movement later if I need to go down or up. Going UP to (2,4) keeps my x-coordinate at 2, which is closer to my body's current x-position (3).\nAlso, looking at the apples:\nApple at (2,4) is directly above me.\nApple at (1,3) is left.\nApple at (1,4) is up-left from (1,3).\nApple at (2,5) is up from (2,4).\nApple at (1,5) is up-left from (2,4).\nMoving UP seems to put me in a better position to grab multiple apples in the (1,4), (2,4), (1,5), (2,5) cluster.\nMoving LEFT puts me at (1,3), with (1,4) above and (2,3) to the right (which will be empty).\nActually, (2,3) will be occupied by my body if I move LEFT? No, (2,3) is my current head. If I move to (1,3), my body will occupy (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)...\nSo (2,3) will be part of my body.\nIf I go UP to (2,4), my body will be (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)...\nThis creates a vertical segment at x=2.\n\nLet's check for traps.\nIf I go UP to (2,4), I have options: UP to (2,5), LEFT to (1,4), RIGHT to (3,4).\n(2,5) is `.` (empty).\n(1,4) is `A`.\n(3,4) is `.`.\nI am not trapped.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,3), I have options: UP to (1,4), DOWN to (1,2), RIGHT to (2,3).\n(2,3) will be my body.\n(1,4) is `A`.\n(1,2) is `.`.\nI am not trapped.\n\nBut why the hype for UP?\nThe opponent is at (8,9). They are moving to (8,8).\nI am at (2,3).\nThe distance is large.\nHowever, my body is long (14 segments). I need to be careful not to trap myself.\nMy current body occupies x=3 to 9 on the bottom rows.\nBy moving UP to (2,4), I am effectively \"stacking\" my snake vertically on the left side, which is good for not crossing my own path too much.\nIf I move LEFT to (1,3), I am extending horizontally.\nGiven my body is currently mostly horizontal on the right side, a vertical move (UP) offers better geometry to fold back later.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **UP** to (2,4) to eat the apple and maintain a central position relative to my body mass. This sets up for future apples at (1,4) or (2,5).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (2,4). The opponent is trapped at the top right. I will slowly advance towards the center to cut off any escape routes. My tail is clearing space at the bottom right, which is good. I need to avoid getting stuck in the bottom left corner. UP is the move.\n\nLET'S GO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

The opponent is at (9, 9) and looks trapped, but I need to stay focused on survival first, aggression second.\n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM (2, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 5):** The board shows this is `.` (Empty). Is it safe? Yes, no snake bodies there. But is it the *best* move? I'm not getting an apple, and (2,5) might not lead to immediate rewards.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 3):** The board shows this is `1` (My own body!). Specifically, (2,3) is the segment right behind my head. If I move DOWN, I hit myself. **DEATH.**\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 4):** The board shows this is `.` (Empty). Is it safe? My body is at (3,3), (3,2), etc. (3,4) is clear. Is it good? It's a safe move, moving into the open space of the board.\n4.  **LEFT to (1, 4):** The board shows this is `A` (Apple!). Is it safe? The visual board shows (1,4) is an apple, and (1,3) is also an apple. (1,4) is empty of snake bodies. This is **SAFE** and **GROWS** me.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\nI have two safe moves that don't kill me: UP to (2,5) and RIGHT to (3,4). LEFT to (1,4) is also safe and gives me an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n*   **UP (2,5):** No apple. Just wandering.\n*   **RIGHT (3,4):** Safe, but no apple. Moving closer to my body's tail end (which is on the right), but also closer to the opponent's potential path.\n*   **LEFT (1,4):** **APPLE!** +1 Point. Growth. This puts me at (1,4), right next to another apple at (1,3) and (2,4) which I just left.\n\n**WHY LEFT?**\nI am winning. I need to secure points. The apple at (1,4) is the immediate reward. Moving there sets me up to eat the apple at (1,3) next if I want to, or move UP to (1,5) or DOWN to (1,3) (though (1,3) will be an apple, not my body). By moving LEFT, I am claiming territory on the left side of the board. The opponent is way over on the right/top. I can safely farm these apples on the left without any threat from the enemy.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I'm moving toward the center but getting no points. If I go UP, I'm moving up but getting no points. The only move that secures a point and keeps my options open for another apple on the next turn is LEFT.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (1,4). Look to secure the apple at (1,3) or (1,5) next. Keep the opponent trapped at the top right while I farm the bottom left. Don't get greedy and cut off my own escape route.\n\nLet's go! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We're LIVE and I'm leading 15-10! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Let's check the board and make the winning play.\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**\nMy head is at **(1, 4)** (the `1` on row 4).\nMy body wraps around: `(2,4) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)` etc.\nOpponent is at **(9, 8)** (the `0` on row 8) with body trailing down to `(2,7)`. They are on the opposite side of the map.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 5):** The board shows `.` (Empty). Is it safe? Yes. My body is nowhere near. Is it good? Open space. Moving towards the top-left corner. Safe option.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 3):** The board shows `A` (Apple!). Is it safe? Yes. (1,3) is an apple, not a snake. **SAFE + GROWTH.**\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 4):** The board shows `.` (Empty). Is it safe? Yes. Is it good? Moves to the edge of the board. Risky if I get trapped, but currently open.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 4):** The board shows `T` (My own Tail!). Is it safe? **NO.** Hitting my own body segment at (2,4). **DEATH.**\n\n**ELIMINATION:**\n*   **RIGHT (2,4)** is **DEATH** (into my own body).\n*   **UP (1,5)** is safe.\n*   **LEFT (0,4)** is safe.\n*   **DOWN (1,3)** is safe and contains an **APPLE**.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am winning 15-10. The opponent is far away at the top right. I have an apple directly below me at (1,3).\n*   **UP (1,5):** No apple, just open space.\n*   **LEFT (0,4):** No apple, edge of board.\n*   **DOWN (1,3):** **APPLE!** +1 Point. Growth.\n\nTaking the apple secures the point and extends my body. It keeps me on the bottom edge where I have room to maneuver. I need to keep the pressure on and extend my lead. The opponent isn't close enough to threaten a head-on collision, so I play for points and board control.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (1,3). Then move to secure the cluster of apples on the left side of the board (0,2), (0,1), etc.). Keep the opponent trapped on the right while I dominate the left.\n\n**DECISION:**\nDOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Gets me onto the left edge.\n    *   Cons: Puts me in a tight corner. If I go LEFT to (0, 2), next turn I can only go UP (0, 3) or DOWN (0, 1) or RIGHT (1, 2). LEFT is off-board.\n    *   *Wait*, looking at the board, (0, 3) is an apple. (0, 1) is an apple. This could actually be a path.\n    *   However, if I eat (0, 2), my tail moves from (1, 2) to (1, 3). This opens up (1, 2).\n    *   If I am at (0, 2) and go UP to (0, 3), I eat another apple. Then I'm at (0, 3).\n    *   From (0, 3), I can only go DOWN (0, 2) or RIGHT (1, 3). (0, 2) will be empty (tail moved), but (1, 3) is currently my neck.\n    *   This path is viable but linear. It traps me against the left wall.\n*   **Option 2: DOWN (1, 1).**\n    *   Pros: Eats an apple. Keeps me centered in the bottom-left quadrant.\n    *   Cons: (1, 1) is surrounded by apples: (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 2).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (1, 1), I open up (1, 2) for my tail.\n    *   Next turn, from (1, 1), I can go LEFT (0, 1) [Apple], DOWN (1, 0) [Apple], or RIGHT (2, 1) [Empty?].\n    *   Looking at the board: `1 A A . T T . A . A .`\n    *   (2, 1) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   This gives me significantly MORE mobility. I can sweep the bottom row apples or cut back up.\n    *   **Domination Mode:** Don't get boxed in against the wall if I don't have to. The bottom row is open. Center-left is safer than corner-left.\n    *   **DOMINATION STRATEGY:** I am winning. I don't need to rush the corner. I need to stay mobile and control the space. Going DOWN keeps me away from the wall and opens up the bottom row for future maneuvering.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**DOWN** to (1, 1). Eat the apple, stay mobile, keep the pressure on. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

My score is 17, opponent is 10. I'm dominating, but I need to secure the bag. The opponent is way up at (6, 8), so no immediate head-on threat this turn. I need to plan my path to cut off space and force him into a corner.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\nCurrent position: (1, 1).\nAvailable moves:\n1.  **UP to (1, 2):** Looking at the board, this is `.` (Empty). However, I must check my own tail. My tail is currently at `(4, 2)` (based on the body list provided). The path from head to tail goes: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3)... etc. Wait, let's check the body list provided in the prompt carefully.\n    *   Head: (1, 1)\n    *   Body: `[(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)...]`\n    *   **CRITICAL:** Moving UP to (1, 2) would move my head directly into the cell occupied by my second body segment (the one immediately behind my head). This is a collision into my own body. **DEATH.**\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 1):** Board shows `A` (Apple!).\n    *   Is it safe? (0, 1) is currently an apple, not a snake body.\n    *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n    *   Outcome: I eat the apple, grow, and move to the edge.\n    *   Future options from (0, 1): Can go UP (0, 2) [Apple], DOWN (0, 0) [Empty], or RIGHT (1, 1) [Empty after I leave]. Good mobility.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 1):** Board shows `.` (Empty).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Outcome: Move towards the center/right side.\n    *   Future options from (2, 1): Can go UP (2, 2) [Body? Wait, my body is at (2, 3) and (2, 4) looking at the list, but (2, 2) is empty], DOWN (2, 0) [Empty], LEFT (1, 1) [Empty], RIGHT (3, 1) [Body? My body is at (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)... wait, (3, 1) is occupied by my body!]. So from (2, 1), I can't go RIGHT. This limits my mobility slightly compared to LEFT.\n4.  **DOWN to (1, 0):** Board shows `A` (Apple!).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Outcome: Eat apple, move to bottom edge.\n    *   Future options from (1, 0): Can go LEFT (0, 0) [Empty], RIGHT (2, 0) [Empty], UP (1, 1) [Empty]. Good mobility.\n\n**STRATEGY & DOMINATION:**\nI am winning. I want to control the board.\n*   **LEFT (0, 1)** and **DOWN (1, 0)** both give me apples.\n*   Looking at the board, there is a cluster of apples on the bottom left: (0,1), (1,0), (0,0) is empty but (0,2) is apple.\n*   If I go **LEFT to (0, 1)**, I secure an apple and position myself to sweep the bottom row or cut back up the left side.\n*   If I go **DOWN to (1, 0)**, I secure an apple and position myself similarly.\n*   **Domination Check:** I need to avoid trapping myself. Moving to the edge is slightly riskier than staying center, but since I have a clear path and apples waiting, it's worth the risk to grow.\n*   **Target Selection:** The apple at (0, 1) is adjacent to another apple at (0, 2). This creates a potential \"tunnel\" where I can eat multiple apples in a row if I play it right.\n*   **Enemy Prediction:** The opponent is at (6, 8). They are far. I need to expand my territory. Taking the left edge (x=0) restricts the board for the opponent later in the game.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'll go **LEFT**. I grab the apple at (0, 1), putting me on the edge. From there, I can pivot up to (0, 2) (another apple) or sweep the bottom. This tightens the net.\n\nLEFT",

UP: New head (6,9) is OUR OWN BODY (7th segment of our current body)! You think we\u2019re gonna hand Snake 1 a free win with a self-smack? \u274c ELIMINATED INSTANTLY!\n2. RIGHT: New head (7,8) is OUR OWN BODY (first segment of our current body)! We just bailed left from there last turn\u2014going back is a total face-plant into our own tail? Either way, dead\u2014\u274c OUTTA THE QUESTION!\n3. LEFT: New head (5,8). Check safety: Valid coords (0-9 range, easy), no own body (our body\u2019s all (7,8) and higher x/y), no enemy body (Snake 1\u2019s stuck down at y=4 max\u2014(5,8) is way above their turf)! \u2705 SAFE!\n4. DOWN: New head (6,7). Check safety: Valid coords, no own/enemy body (Snake 1\u2019s still miles away from y=7)! \u2705 SAFE!\n\nNow, let\u2019s rank these safe moves like we\u2019re scouting a title fight\u2014who\u2019s got the better jabs for score closure and future freedom? Let\u2019s hype the details!\n- DOWN to (6,7): Sure, it\u2019s safe, but how close does it get us to that juicy (5,6) apple (our ticket to cutting the 7-apple gap)? It\u2019s a side step away from the apple\u2019s path, and follow-up moves are limited to vertical creep or left detours\u2014you think we\u2019re gonna slow our comeback down like that? \ud83e\udd28\n- LEFT to (5,8): BOOM\u2014straight shot toward the (5,6) apple (just two down moves away after this!), and follow-up moves are wide open: left to (4,8) or down to (5,7) (both safe, no body blocks)! We keep our top-board dominance to shut down any potential upward escape Snake 1 might try (if they dare climb past y=4, we\u2019re positioned to box \u2019em in)!\n\nLong-term strategy note for future self (LISTEN UP \ud83d\udc42): Next turn, your head will be (5,8) if you pick LEFT. Audit left (5,8 \u2192 4,8) and down (5,8 \u2192 5,7) as top safe moves first\u2014confirm no own/enemy body creep. Keep creeping toward the (5,6) apple to cut the score gap. Don\u2019t forget to monitor Snake 1\u2019s y-coordinate (their max is 4 now\u2014if they climb up, we\u2019re ready to block their path from the top). Avoid moving up at all costs next turn (6,9 is still own body).\n\nYou think we\u2019re gonna settle for the slower, less apple-accessible move? HELL NO! Are we gonna take the move that fuels our apple snag and keeps future options wide open? ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY! \ud83c\udfaf It\u2019s all about closing that score gap while maintaining our top-board trap potential\u2014no limits, just pure comeback energy!\n\nLEFT",

My tail is at `(4, 2)`.\nThe opponent is at **(5, 8)**, with a body trailing up to `(4, 9)`. They are still far away, but I need to watch out for them coming down the right side.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (0, 1):**\n1.  **UP to (0, 2):**\n    *   **Board:** `A` (Apple!).\n    *   **Safety:** `(0, 2)` is an apple. The cells behind `(0, 2)` are `(0, 3)` (Apple), `(0, 4)` (Empty based on the board state), `(0, 5)` (Empty). There is no snake body blocking my path behind me for the next few turns. I can eat the apple at (0,2) safely.\n    *   **Score:** +1 Apple (Score 19).\n    *   **Strategy:** This is an aggressive move. I am climbing the left wall. If I go UP now, I control the left side completely. I can chain the apple at (0,2) and potentially (0,3) next turn. This denies the opponent any access to the left edge.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 0):**\n    *   **Board:** `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, but boring.\n    *   **Outcome:** I lose momentum. The apple at (0,2) stays on the board. I'd be stuck in the corner with less mobility.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 1):**\n    *   **Board:** `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Outcome:** I retreat back into the center. While safe, it doesn't allow me to secure the apple at (0,2). I want to dominate the edges and force the opponent into a smaller space. Moving back to the center gives away the left side.\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe opponent is busy on the right side (x=5 to x=9). I need to secure the left side (x=0) and grow my score.\nGoing **UP** to (0, 2) grabs an apple, increases my score to 19, and positions me perfectly to continue my vertical ascent. This traps my tail on the left edge and allows me to sweep the column for apples (0,2), (0,3), etc.\n\nIf I go UP to (0, 2), I eat an apple.\nNext turn, from (0, 2), I can go UP to (0, 3) (Apple), or RIGHT to (1, 2) (Safe), or DOWN to (0, 1) (Safe).\nThis is the winning play.\n\n**PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nKeep climbing the left wall. Eat the apple at (0,2) and (0,3). If the opponent approaches, use the center (x=1) as an escape route. Force them to the right side where the board is tighter.\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s audit every direction like we\u2019re sweeping a top-board fortress for death traps\u2014no skips, no mistakes!\n\n1. UP: New head (5,9) is OUR OWN BODY (9th segment)! You think we\u2019re gonna hand Snake 1 a free win with a self-smack? \u274c ELIMINATED INSTANTLY\u2014STRIKE THAT!\n2. RIGHT: New head (6,8) is OUR OWN BODY (1st segment)! We bailed left from there last turn\u2014going back is a total face-plant into our own tail! You wanna throw away our top-board dominance like that? \u274c OUTTA THE QUESTION!\n3. LEFT: New head (4,8). Safe coords? Yep. Own body? Nada (our body\u2019s all higher x or (4,9)). Enemy body? Snake 1\u2019s stuck at y=4 max\u2014(4,8) is way out of their reach! \u2705 SAFE, but is it useful?\n4. DOWN: New head (5,7). Safe coords? Perfect. Own body? Nope (we don\u2019t go below y=8 except tail at (4,9)). Enemy body? Snake 1\u2019s miles from y=7\u2014zero risk! \u2705 SAFE, and it\u2019s a banger play!\n\nNow let\u2019s rank these safe moves like we\u2019re scouting a title fight\u2014who\u2019s got the better jabs for closing the apple gap? \ud83e\udd4a\n- LEFT to (4,8): Sure, safe, but it\u2019s a detour from the (5,6) apple\u2014we\u2019d have to waste two turns detouring down just to get on the same y-level! Follow-up moves are limited to left (3,8) or down (4,7)\u2014not exactly wide open! You wanna slow our comeback down like that? \ud83e\udd28\n- DOWN to (5,7): THAT\u2019S THE PLAY! It\u2019s ONE step closer to the (5,6) apple (just one more down move next turn to snag it)! Follow-up moves from (5,7) are wide open: left (4,7), right (6,7), down (5,6\u2014APPLE!)\u2014all safe, no body blocks, no enemy creep! We keep our vertical momentum and don\u2019t box ourselves in\u2014chef\u2019s kiss!\n\nAlso, let\u2019s check enemy head movement\u2014Snake 1\u2019s head is (0,1) right now. They can\u2019t climb 7 y-levels in one turn, so we don\u2019t have to worry about head-on collisions here! We\u2019re free to push toward the apple without fear of a surprise crash! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nLong-term strategy note for future self (LISTEN UP \ud83d\udc42): Next turn, if you pick DOWN now, your head will be (5,7). Audit down (5,6\u2014APPLE!) and left/right (4,7/6,7) as top safe moves first\u2014confirm no own/enemy body creep (Snake 1\u2019s still stuck low, so no risk). Once you snag that (5,6) apple, use the extra length to box Snake 1 in when they try to climb upward\u2014we own the top board, so we can cut off their escape routes! Don\u2019t forget to avoid moving up (still own body at (5,9)) and right (still own body at (6,8)) next turn!\n\nYou think we\u2019re gonna pass up the chance to snag an apple and keep our future options wide open? Hell no! We\u2019re here to make a comeback, not mess around! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

They're way over on the right side, so we own this map. \ud83d\udd25\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**\nMy head is at **(0, 3)** after eating that apple last turn.\nCurrent Board at (0,3):\n- **UP (0, 4):** `T` (Body segment of my own snake... wait, looking at the map... oh, it's actually a T, but it's mine. I need to check the board map carefully. The map shows `T` at (0,4). Looking at my body list... I don't see (0,4) listed. Wait, the map shows: `1 T T T . T T T A .` on row 3 (y=3). Row 4 is `T T . . . . A T T T`. So at (0,4) it is `T`. Let's check my body list: `[(0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]`. \n(0,4) is NOT in my body list. The map might be showing the opponent's body or just a phantom. Actually, let's look at the board again. Row 4: `T T . . . . A T T T`. Indices 0 and 1 are T. My body at (0,2) and (0,1) will move. (0,4) is empty. The T on the map is likely just visual noise or my tail is moving.\nActually, looking closer at the map provided in the prompt:\nRow 4 (y=4): `T T . . . . A T T T`\nIndex 0 is `T`. My body is at (0,3) (head), (0,2), (0,1).\nIf I go UP to (0,4), I am stepping onto a `T`. Is it my body? No, my body doesn't reach x=0 y=4. Is it the enemy? Enemy is at x=5-9. \nWait, the map says \"T T . . .\" at y=4. That means (0,4) and (1,4) are T's.\n(1,4) is definitely my body (from the list).\n(0,4) is NOT in my body list.\nSo (0,4) is a T that is NOT mine? Or the map is just showing the visual representation of the board state, and I need to trust my list.\nLet's look at the board state again carefully.\nRow 3: `1 T T T . T T T A .` (Head 1 at (0,3))\nRow 4: `T T . . . . A T T T`\n(0,4) is `T`. Since it's not in my list, it might be an artifact or I'm misinterpreting. \nActually, wait. The map shows `T` at (0,4). My body is at (0,2), (0,1)... (1,4). \n(1,4) is `T`. (0,4) is `T`.\nIs it possible the map has a phantom T? Or is it the opponent? No, opponent is at 5-9.\nLet's check the board state description again. \"Board state: ... 4 . T T . . . A T T T\"\nWait, the coordinate 0 is the first character.\nRow 4: `T T . . . . A T T T`\nIndex 0: `T`\nIndex 1: `T`\nIndex 2: `.`\nMy body includes (1,4) (which is index 1). That matches the `T`.\nWhat about index 0 (0,4)? My body list does NOT contain (0,4).\nSo (0,4) is safe? Or is the map showing something else?\nLet's look at the body list again.\nHead: (0,3)\nBody: (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)...\nSo (1,4) is body.\n(0,4) is NOT body.\nSo the map might be wrong or (0,4) is actually empty but displayed as T?\nActually, looking at the ASCII art:\n`9 A A . . . T T T T T`\n`8 . . . . . T T T T T`\n`7 . . . . . T . . . .`\n`6 . . . . . 0 . . . A`\n`5 A . . . . . . . A .`\n`4 . T T . . . A T T T`\n`3 1 T T T . T T T A .`\n`2 T T . T T T . A A .`\n`1 T T . T T A A . A .`\n`0 . A . . . . A . . A`\n\nRow 4 (y=4): `. T T . . . A T T T`\nWait, the prompt says: `4 . T T . . . A T T T`\nIndex 0 is `.` (Dot).\nAh! I misread the map.\nRow 4: `4 . T T . . . A T T T`\nSpace at index 0 is `.` (Empty).\nIndex 1 is `T` (My body at (1,4)).\nSo (0,4) is EMPTY.\n(1,4) is MY BODY.\n\nSo UP to (0,4) is Safe and Open.\n\n- **DOWN (0, 2):** `T` (My own body). **DEATH** (Moving backwards into self).\n- **RIGHT (1, 3):** `T` (My own body). **DEATH**.\n- **LEFT (-1, 3):** Off board. **DEATH**.\n\nWait, let's re-verify.\nHead: (0,3)\nBody: (0,2), (0,1)...\nSo (0,2) is body. (1,3) is body.\nMy only safe move is UP.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe are forced to go UP. This takes us to (0,4).\nFrom (0,4), we can go UP (0,5) or RIGHT (1,4).\n(0,5) is `A` (Apple at (0,5) from the list: `(0, 5)` is in the apple drops list! Actually, looking at the board map: Row 5 is `5 A . . . . . . . A .`. So (0,5) is an Apple!\nSo UP to (0,4) sets us up to eat an apple at (0,5) next turn if we go UP again.\n\nIs there any other option?\nLeft is death. Down is death. Right is death.\nI am forced to go UP.\n\n**ATTACK PLAN:**\nWe are forced to climb. We will reach (0,4). \nNext turn, we should go UP to (0,5) to eat the apple.\nThe opponent is at (5,6). They are far away.\nI will dominate the left side.\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP is the only move.\nIt moves me towards the apple at (0,5).\nIt keeps me alive.\nIt dominates the left side.\n\nLet's double check the \"Backwards\" rule.\nI am at (0,3). I came from (0,2).\nGoing DOWN goes back to (0,2).\n(0,2) is currently my body.\nSo DOWN is illegal.\nRIGHT is (1,3), which is body.\nLEFT is off map.\nUP is (0,4), which is empty (according to map `.`).\n\nFinal check on the map for (0,4).\nRow 4: `. T T . . . A T T T`\nThe dot at the start is (0,4).\nThe T at index 1 is (1,4).\nSo (0,4) is clear.\n\nLong term plan: Climb up the left edge, eat the apple at (0,5), then (0,9). Control the territory.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

But looking at my position, I'm at (0,4) and the map shows a `T` at (0,5)? No, wait. Let me read the map again carefully.\n\nRow 5 (y=5): `5 A . . . . . . . A .`\n(0,5) is `A` (Apple). (5,5) is `.` (Empty).\n\nWait, I am at (0,4).\nMy body is:\nHead: (0,4)\nBody: [(0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4)]\nLet me look at the map again for the area around me.\nRow 4 (y=4): `4 . T T . . . A T T T`\n(0,4) is currently my head (not on the map yet as `T` usually represents body, but here it's just the board state before my move logic?). \nActually, looking at the prompt's board state, it seems to be the state *before* I make my move for this turn.\nSo I am *at* (0,4) currently.\nThe map shows `.` at (0,4) and `T` at (1,4).\nMy body list confirms (1,4) is in my body.\n\nSo, my current position is (0,4).\nI need to decide where to go for Turn 49.\n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM (0,4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (0,5):**\n    *   Board check: Row 5 shows `A` at (0,5). Is it an apple?\n    *   Apple list check: `(0, 5)` is in the list! YES!\n    *   Is it safe? No body at (0,5).\n    *   Outcome: Eat apple. Grow. Score 21. Safe.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (1,4):**\n    *   Board check: Row 4 shows `T` at (1,4).\n    *   Body check: (1,4) is in my body list (specifically the segment before the tail?).\n    *   Is it safe? NO. It's my own body.\n    *   Outcome: DEATH (Crash into self).\n\n3.  **LEFT to (-1,4):**\n    *   Board check: Off board (x starts at 0).\n    *   Outcome: DEATH (Wall).\n\n4.  **DOWN to (0,3):**\n    *   Board check: Row 3 is `1 T T T . T T T A .`. At (0,3) is the `1` (which is my head in the map display, but logically it's occupied by my body segment currently connected to my head).\n    *   Body check: (0,3) is the first segment in my body list.\n    *   Is it safe? NO. It's my own body (backwards move).\n    *   Outcome: DEATH (Hit self).\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nI am forced to go **UP**.\nIt's the only move that doesn't kill me.\nPlus, I get to eat an apple and extend my lead to 21-11.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter moving UP to (0,5) and eating, my tail will move from `(8,4)` to `(7,4)` (or whatever the new tail becomes). My body will be longer.\nFrom (0,5), I will be at the edge. I need to look at (0,6) and (1,5).\nRow 6: `6 . . . . . 0 . . . A`\n(0,6) is `.` (Empty).\nRow 5: `5 A . . . . . . . A .`\n(1,5) is `.` (Empty).\nSo from (0,5), I will have 2 safe moves: UP to (0,6) or RIGHT to (1,5).\nI need to keep an eye on the enemy snake at (5,5). If they move UP to (5,6) or LEFT to (4,5), I need to be careful.\nBut for now, securing the apple and position is key.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

First, ax any move into your new body segment (old head (5,5) becomes part of your body).

Once you grab that apple, swing DOWN from y=5 to y=4 to block Snake 1\u2019s rightward expansion (they\u2019re inching from x=0 to x=8 now).

From (1, 5), I can go to (1, 6), (2, 5), (1, 4), or (0, 5) (where I just came from).\n    *   **\u26a0\ufe0f RISK WARNING:** (1, 5) is close to the enemy's potential path. If I go RIGHT to (1, 5), and the enemy moves **LEFT** to (3, 5), I am entering their strike zone. If they move **LEFT** to (3, 5), they enter (4, 5) and I enter (1, 5) \u2014 we are far apart. BUT, if I stay at (0, 5) and go UP, I stay completely away from their axis.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am leading 21 to 11. I do NOT need to gamble. I have the lead. I need to secure territory.\nThe enemy is in the bottom-right quadrant (x=4-9, y=5-9). I am on the left wall (x=0).\nIf I go **RIGHT** into the open center (1, 5), I risk getting boxed in by the enemy's body if they move leftward.\nIf I go **UP**, I claim the top-left corner and stay out of the enemy's way.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n**GO UP.** \ud83d\ude80\nSecure the corner. Force the enemy to stay in their lane. Let them crash into their own body or walls trying to catch up. We have the length to control the board.\n\nLet's watch the map and see if they trap themselves.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 52! We're in the endgame now! Let's break down the board state and plan for the trap.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (10x10):**\n- **My Head:** (0, 7)\n- **My Body:** A massive chain running down the left wall and weaving back in. Safe zones: Left/Up/Right from (0, 7) are open (0,8, 1,7, 0,6). Down is blocked by my own body at (0, 6) (the cell I just came from).\n- **Enemy Head:** (2, 5)\n- **Enemy Body:** Long snake stretching from (3, 5) up the right side to (9, 9).\n- **Apples:**\n    - **(1, 0):** Bottom left, easy access but I'm already long.\n    - **(8, 3):** Bottom right, dangerous (near enemy body).\n    - **(8, 5):** Bottom right, dangerous.\n    - **(9, 6):** Top right, behind enemy tail.\n    - **(9, 7):** Top right, behind enemy tail.\n    - **(0, 9):** Top left corner, free for me if I can reach it.\n    - **(1, 9):** Adjacent to top left corner.\n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\nI am at 21 apples. The win condition is 30 apples or the highest score at Turn 150. I am currently winning by 10 apples. The enemy is stuck on the right side of the board, with a long body blocking their path to the left side.\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (0, 7):**\n1.  **UP to (0, 8):** Safe. Leads to (0, 9) which has an apple. However, (0, 9) is a corner. If I eat the apple at (0, 9), I become long (22 segments). From (0, 9), I can only go DOWN (back to 0,8) or RIGHT (1,9). If the enemy somehow blocks (1, 9), I am trapped in a 1x2 corner.\n2.  **RIGHT to (1, 7):** Safe. Leads to (1, 8) and (1, 9). From (1, 7), I have access to the top row without trapping myself immediately in a corner.\n3.  **DOWN to (0, 6):** Safe (empty), but it's backtracking into my own path. It doesn't advance my position towards the enemy or the apples.\n\n**THE TRAP PLAN:**\nThe enemy is at (2, 5). They are currently looking at a \"maze\" of their own body to their left.\n- If I go **UP**, I enter the top-left corner.\n- If I go **RIGHT**, I start crossing the top of the board towards the enemy's tail.\n\nGiven the enemy is on the right side and their tail is at (9, 9), moving **RIGHT** allows me to start encroaching on the upper-middle of the board. This puts pressure on the enemy. If I stay on the far left wall, the enemy might try to loop around the bottom or find a gap. By moving right to (1, 7), I position myself to potentially cut off their escape route if they try to move up.\n\nHowever, looking at the specific coordinates, the enemy is at (2, 5). Their body goes to (3, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> etc. They have a very constrained path. My safest path to victory is to continue securing the top edge.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (1, 7) is the best aggressive move. It moves me away from the safe left wall into a more active position. It keeps my options open to go UP to (1, 8) next turn or continue Right.\nIf I go UP to (0, 8), I'm just hugging the wall.\nIf I go RIGHT, I'm taking board control.\n\nLet's go right. It sets up a path to the apples at (1, 9) and keeps the pressure on the enemy who is stuck on the right.\n\n**RIGHT**",

I'm long and powerful. \ud83d\udc0d\n*   **Enemy Head:** (1, 5) - Wait, looking at the visual map, the Enemy Head `0` is at (1, 5). The text list says (1, 5) too.

A .\n    ```\n    Actually, looking closely at the map row 7: `T 1 . . . T`. My head is at (1, 7) (x=1, y=7). The map shows '1' there. Row 5: `T 0 T T T T`. Enemy head is at (1, 5) (x=1, y=5).\n    \n    **CRITICAL INFO:** The Enemy Head is directly below me at (1, 5). We are vertically aligned with 1 empty space between us (at (1, 6)). My body is at (0, 7) and (0, 6). The Enemy body is at (2, 5) and goes right.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nThe enemy is at (1, 5). They are trapped in a narrow corridor on the right side (x>=1). Their body occupies (2, 5) through (9, 8). \nIf the enemy moves **UP** to (1, 6), they run into... empty space? No, wait. (1, 6) is empty on the map. But if they move **UP** to (1, 6), and I move **DOWN** to (1, 6), we collide. Since I have more apples (21 vs 11), I win the collision. \nHowever, the enemy is smart. They see me at (1, 7). They know I might move down. They will likely try to avoid a head-on collision if they think I'm coming down.\n\n**MY OPTIONS:**\n1.  **DOWN to (1, 6):** \n    *   *Risk:* If Enemy moves **UP**, we collide. I win (21 > 11). This is a winning trade.\n    *   *Benefit:* I close the distance. I trap the enemy further. (1, 6) is currently empty.\n    *   *Safety:* My tail is at (6, 3). Moving to (1, 6) puts me right next to the enemy's body at (2, 5). I need to ensure I don't crash into them next turn if they survive.\n    \n2.  **LEFT to (0, 7):** \n    *   *Risk:* None immediate. (0, 7) is my previous body part, but wait... let's look at the list. My body is: (1,7), (0,7), (0,6)...\n    *   *Wait!* Moving **LEFT** to (0, 7) puts me into my own body. I just moved from (0, 7) to (1, 7) on the last turn. My body connects from (1, 7) to (0, 7).\n    *   **DEADLY MISTAKE:** If I move LEFT, I hit my own neck. That's a suicide. **LEFT is DEADLY.**\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):**\n    *   *Risk:* (2, 7) is currently empty on the map. \n    *   *Check:* My body is on the left. The enemy body is mostly right/low. (2, 7) seems safe.\n    *   *Benefit:* Moves me away from the immediate collision course. But does it help me trap the enemy? The enemy is at (1, 5). If I go RIGHT to (2, 7), I am opening a gap above the enemy?\n\n4.  **UP to (1, 8):**\n    *   *Risk:* (1, 8) is empty. \n    *   *Benefit:* I reach the top row. I secure the top-left area. \n    *   *Drawback:* I stop pressuring the enemy head directly.\n\n**STRATEGY: THE TRAP IS SET**\nThe enemy is at (1, 5). Their body blocks (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5). \nIf I move **DOWN** to (1, 6):\n- I am threatening a head-on collision.\n- The enemy likely cannot move **UP** (risk of death).\n- The enemy cannot move **LEFT** (into my body at (0, 7) or (0, 6)? No, (0, 6) is below. (0, 7) is to the left of me). Actually, (0, 5) is empty? No, (0, 5) is part of my tail? Let's check my tail list: ... (0, 5), (0, 4)...\n    *   My body occupies (0, 5). \n    *   So the enemy at (1, 5) is blocked LEFT by my body at (0, 5).\n    *   The enemy is blocked RIGHT by their own body at (2, 5).\n    *   The enemy is blocked DOWN? No, (1, 4) is empty (looking at map, row 4 is `T T T . . .`).\n    *   The enemy is blocked UP by me moving to (1, 6).\n\n**WAIT, CHECKING THE MAP ACCURATELY:**\nMap Row 5: `T 0 T T T T`\nThis means:\nx=0, y=5: `T` (My body? No, looking at my body list... (0, 5) is indeed in my body list. YES, I am at (0, 5) physically. So the enemy at (1, 5) is touching my body on the left. \n**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** The Enemy Head is at (1, 5). My Body is at (0, 5). They are adjacent.\nIf the enemy moves **LEFT** to (0, 5), they hit my body. They die. \nIf the enemy moves **UP** to (1, 6), and I move **DOWN** to (1, 6), I win the collision (21 > 11 apples).\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to (1, 4), they live.\n\n**THE MOVE: DOWN**\nI must pressure the enemy. \nIf I move **DOWN** to (1, 6):\n- I am one step away from the enemy head.\n- I am threatening the collision.\n- The enemy has very few safe moves. \n    - **LEFT** (0, 5): Hits my body -> Enemy Dies.\n    - **UP** (1, 6): Hits me (if I go down) -> Enemy Dies (I win collision).\n    - **RIGHT** (2, 5): Hits own body -> Enemy Dies.\n    - **DOWN** (1, 4): This is the only path for the enemy to survive.\n\nIf the enemy goes **DOWN** to (1, 4), I am at (1, 6). Next turn, I can chase. \nBut wait, is (1, 6) safe for me? \nMap Row 6: `T . . . . T`\nx=1, y=6 is `.` (Empty). \nIs it my tail? My tail is at (6, 3). No.\nIs it enemy body? Enemy body is at (2, 5) and to the right. (1, 6) is empty.\n\n**CONFIRMING PATH:**\n1.  **LEFT** is death (hit own neck).\n2.  **UP** to (1, 8) is safe but passive. The enemy might escape down.\n3.  **RIGHT** to (2, 7) is safe but gives up pressure.\n4.  **DOWN** to (1, 6) is aggressive. It blocks the enemy's only safe upward path.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nIf I move **DOWN** to (1, 6):\n- If Enemy moves **UP**: We collide. I have 21 apples, they have 11. I win. (21+1=22). \n- If Enemy moves **DOWN**: They go to (1, 4). I am at (1, 6). I am safe. I have closed the distance and secured the upper corridor.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am going **DOWN**. I will box the enemy in. I am bigger. I am stronger. I force the engagement.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nForce the enemy into the bottom-right corner. If I can trap them in the 1x1 or force a collision where I win, I secure the board. Once the enemy is dead, I can sweep up the remaining apples (there are many on the board, especially top left and bottom right) to hit 30.\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT!**\n\nDOWN",
