To reach it, I need to move right and down. Moving RIGHT to (7, 8) then DOWN twice would get me close. However, moving DOWN to (6, 7) keeps me more centered and flexible.\n\nThe enemy snake is still just a head at (8, 6). It's small and not an immediate threat. Since I have 4 apples and the enemy has 0, I'm ahead.\n\nBetween RIGHT and DOWN:\n- RIGHT gets me closer to (8, 4) horizontally\n- DOWN keeps more flexible movement options and doesn't lock me into the right side of the board\n\nI'll move DOWN to (6, 7) to maintain flexibility while keeping the (8, 4) apple as a reachable target.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 14: Move RIGHT to (7, 7) to get closer to (8, 4)\n- Turn 15: Move DOWN to (7, 6) or continue strategizing based on enemy movement\n- Keep targeting (8, 4) as the next apple since it's relatively close and accessible\n- Monitor enemy snake - if it grows significantly, adjust strategy to avoid collisions\n\nDOWN",
