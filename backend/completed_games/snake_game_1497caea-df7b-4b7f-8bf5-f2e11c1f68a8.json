The enemy snake, #1, is at position (9, 5) with no body length.\n\nWe just moved up and reached the position (3, 6), where there is an apple. According to the rules, if we move onto an apple, we grow and gain 1 point. Since we are already at the apple's position, we can't move up again to get the apple. \n\nThe closest apple to our current position is now at (6, 6) or (7, 6), which are to the right of our current position, or at (2, 4), which is to the left and down from our current position. \n\nMoving right would put us closer to the apples at (6, 6) or (7, 6) and also create some distance between us and the enemy snake at (9, 5) is not a concern in this case since we are not moving towards it. \n\nConsidering the rules and the current board state, moving right seems like a good move to make progress towards an apple.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Continue to prioritize moving towards the nearest apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position to avoid collisions. We should also start thinking about how to position ourselves for future moves to maximize our chances of getting more apples.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
