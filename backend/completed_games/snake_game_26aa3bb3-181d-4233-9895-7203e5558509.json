DOWN: Would go to (1, 8) - Safe, moves towards apple at (4, 8) and (0, 7)\n3. LEFT: Would go to (0, 9) - Safe, but moving towards corner\n4. RIGHT: Would go to (2, 9) - Safe, could eventually go towards apples\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9, 0), far away from me, so no immediate collision risk.\n\nLet me think about apple distances:\n- From (1, 9):\n  - (4, 1): Manhattan distance = |4-1| + |1-9| = 3 + 8 = 11\n  - (5, 5): Manhattan distance = |5-1| + |5-9| = 4 + 4 = 8\n  - (4, 8): Manhattan distance = |4-1| + |8-9| = 3 + 1 = 4\n  - (6, 1): Manhattan distance = |6-1| + |1-9| = 5 + 8 = 13\n  - (0, 7): Manhattan distance = |0-1| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nClosest apples are:\n1. (0, 7) at distance 3\n2. (4, 8) at distance 4\n\nFor (0, 7), I would need to go LEFT and then DOWN twice.\nFor (4, 8), I would need to go DOWN once and then RIGHT three times.\n\nLet me think about the best strategy:\n\nOption 1: Go for (0, 7)\n- From (1, 9), go LEFT to (0, 9)\n- Then DOWN to (0, 8)\n- Then DOWN to (0, 7) - get apple!\n\nOption 2: Go for (4, 8)\n- From (1, 9), go DOWN to (1, 8)\n- Then RIGHT to (2, 8)\n- Then RIGHT to (3, 8)\n- Then RIGHT to (4, 8) - get apple!\n\nBoth options seem viable. Let me consider which is better strategically:\n\nGoing for (0, 7) puts me in the corner, which could limit my options.\nGoing for (4, 8) keeps me more in the middle of the board with more flexibility.\n\nAlso, after getting (4, 8), I'd be closer to (5, 5) which is another apple.\n\nI think DOWN is the better move - it moves me towards (4, 8) and keeps my options more open. I can also still pivot to (0, 7) if needed.\n\nLet me verify DOWN is safe:\n- DOWN from (1, 9) goes to (1, 8)\n- (1, 8) is within bounds\n- I have no body to collide with\n- Enemy snake is at (9, 0), far away\n\nDOWN is safe and moves me towards the closer apples (4, 8) and (0, 7).\n\nStrategy note for next turns:\n- Primary target: (4, 8) - go RIGHT after this move\n- Secondary target: (0, 7) if I change direction\n- After (4, 8), consider (5, 5)\n- Enemy snake is in bottom right, so I have top-left and middle area to myself for now\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the board, my head is at (1, 9) in the top-left area.\n\nLet me analyze my options:\n- UP: Would go to (1, 10) - OUT OF BOUNDS, death!\n- DOWN: Would go to (1, 8) - Safe\n- LEFT: Would go to (0, 9) - Safe, but corner\n- RIGHT: Would go to (2, 9) - Safe\n\nEnemy snake is at (9, 0), far away in the opposite corner, so no immediate collision threat.\n\nLooking at nearby apples:\n- (0, 7): Distance 3 - would need LEFT, DOWN, DOWN\n- (4, 8): Distance 4 - would need DOWN, then 3 RIGHTs\n\nGoing for (4, 8) is better strategically because:\n1. It keeps me more central on the board with more options\n2. After getting it, I'll be close to (5, 5)\n3. Going to (0, 7) would trap me in the corner\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\n- Move DOWN now to (1, 8)\n- Then move RIGHT towards (4, 8) to collect that apple\n- After that, target (5, 5) in the middle\n- The enemy is focused on the bottom-right apples (4, 1) and (6, 1), so I can safely collect top/middle apples\n\nDOWN",

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.\n\nCurrent state:\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (1, 8), no body, 0 apples\n- Enemy snake (ID 0): Head at (9, 1), no body, 0 apples\n- Apples at: (4, 1), (5, 5), (4, 8), (6, 1), (0, 7)\n\nBoard visualization:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . 1 . .

A . . 0\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head is at (1, 8). Let me check all possible moves:\n\n1. UP: (1, 9) - Safe, within bounds\n2. DOWN: (1, 7) - Safe, within bounds, moves toward apple at (0, 7)\n3. LEFT: (0, 8) - Safe, within bounds, moves toward apple at (0, 7)\n4. RIGHT: (2, 8) - Safe, within bounds, moves toward apple at (4, 8)\n\nAll four moves are safe since I have no body to collide with and the enemy snake is far away at (9, 1).\n\nLet me calculate distances to apples from my current position (1, 8):\n- (4, 8): |4-1| + |8-8| = 3 (same row, just 3 right)\n- (0, 7): |0-1| + |7-8| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- (5, 5): |5-1| + |5-8| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- (4, 1): |4-1| + |1-8| = 3 + 7 = 10\n- (6, 1): |6-1| + |1-8| = 5 + 7 = 12\n\nClosest apples:\n1. (0, 7) - distance 2\n2. (4, 8) - distance 3\n\nFrom my last move, I moved DOWN from (1, 9) to (1, 8). My previous strategy was to go for (4, 8).\n\nNow let me reconsider:\n\nOption 1: Go for (0, 7)\n- LEFT to (0, 8)\n- DOWN to (0, 7) - get apple! (2 moves)\n\nOption 2: Go for (4, 8)\n- RIGHT to (2, 8)\n- RIGHT to (3, 8)\n- RIGHT to (4, 8) - get apple! (3 moves)\n\nGoing for (0, 7) is faster (2 moves vs 3 moves). However, it puts me in the corner. But actually, after getting (0, 7), I could then go for (4, 8) or (5, 5).\n\nLet me think about the enemy snake. It's at (9, 1), very close to apples (6, 1) and (4, 1). It will likely go for those.\n\nSince the enemy is focused on the bottom right area, I can safely collect apples in the top left and center.\n\nLet me decide:\n- (0, 7) is closest at distance 2\n- But going LEFT now takes me to (0, 8), which is one step from (0, 7)\n- Going DOWN takes me to (1, 7), which is also one step from (0, 7)\n\nActually wait, if I go DOWN to (1, 7), then LEFT to (0, 7), I get the apple in 2 moves.\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 8), then DOWN to (0, 7), I also get the apple in 2 moves.\n\nBoth paths work. Let me think about positioning after:\n- If I go DOWN then LEFT: I end at (0, 7) facing left\n- If I go LEFT then DOWN: I end at (0, 7) facing down\n\nAfter getting (0, 7), the next closest apple would be (4, 8) or (5, 5).\n\nFrom (0, 7) to (4, 8): |4-0| + |8-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\nFrom (0, 7) to (5, 5): |5-0| + |5-7| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nSo after (0, 7), I should head to (4, 8).\n\nGoing DOWN now to (1, 7) keeps me slightly more central and gives me flexibility. But going LEFT is more direct towards (0, 7).\n\nI'll go LEFT to start heading directly to (0, 7).\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n- This turn: LEFT to (0, 8)\n- Next turn: DOWN to (0, 7) - collect apple\n- Then head RIGHT and UP towards (4, 8)\n</budget_strategy>\n\nLooking at the current board, my head is at (1, 8).\n\nLet me analyze my options:\n- UP: (1, 9) - Safe\n- DOWN: (1, 7) - Safe, closer to (0, 7)\n- LEFT: (0, 8) - Safe, direct path to (0, 7)\n- RIGHT: (2, 8) - Safe, towards (4, 8)\n\nAll moves are safe since I have no body and the enemy is at (9, 1), far away.\n\nCalculating distances to nearest apples:\n- (0, 7): Distance 2 - very close!\n- (4, 8): Distance 3\n\nThe enemy snake at (9, 1) will likely go for (6, 1) or (4, 1) since they're nearest to it. I have the top-left and center area to myself.\n\nGoing for (0, 7) first makes sense - it's the closest apple at just 2 moves away:\n- LEFT to (0, 8)\n- Then DOWN to (0, 7) - collect apple!\n\nAfter getting (0, 7), I can then head toward (4, 8) by going RIGHT and UP.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- This turn: LEFT to (0, 8)\n- Next turn: DOWN to (0, 7) to collect apple\n- After that: Head toward (4, 8) by moving RIGHT and UP\n- Then target (5, 5) in the center\n\nLEFT",
