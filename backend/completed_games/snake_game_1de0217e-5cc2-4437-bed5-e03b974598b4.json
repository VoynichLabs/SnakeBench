Both snakes are currently vertical with my head above the enemy's head (same x-coordinate, higher y)\n2. The closest apple to me is at (6,3) - 2 right and 4 down\n3.

Let me evaluate which direction gets me closer to this apple:\n- UP: (5,6) - Distance to (6,3) becomes 4 (worse)\n- DOWN: (5,4) - Distance to (6,3) becomes 2 (better)\n- LEFT: (4,5) - Distance to (6,3) becomes 4 (worse)\n- RIGHT: (6,5) - Distance to (6,3) becomes 2 (better)\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT get me closer to the apple at (6,3). However, I should also consider the enemy snake at (5,7), which is directly above me. Moving UP would bring me closer to the enemy, increasing collision risk. Moving RIGHT keeps me away from the enemy while still making progress toward the apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,5) puts me in the same column as the apple at (6,3), which is advantageous for future moves. This move also maintains flexibility for subsequent turns.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move toward the nearest apple (6,3)\n- After eating the apple, look for the next closest apple\n- Try to avoid the enemy snake\n- Keep my options open for future moves\n\nRIGHT<|end_of_box|>\n<|begin_of_box|>RIGHT<|end_of_box|>",

Let me consider which move is best strategically.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n- (1, 3) is far away (7 units left, 0 units up/down)\n- (1, 4) is far away (7 units left, 1 unit up)\n- (8, 9) is far away (0 units left/right, 6 units up)\n- (4, 3) is 4 units left, 0 units up/down\n- (9, 1) is 1 unit right, 2 units down\n\nThe closest apple is at (9, 1), which is just 1 unit to the right and 2 units down from my current position. Moving RIGHT to (9, 3) would get me closer to this apple.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the overall strategy. Moving RIGHT to (9, 3) puts me at the edge of the board, which could limit my future options. I should maintain flexibility by staying in the middle of the board if possible.\n\nLooking at the board, I'm currently at (8, 3). The apple at (4, 3) is in the same row as me, 4 units to the left. Moving LEFT to (7, 3) would get me closer to this apple.\n\nI think the best move is LEFT to (7, 3) as it keeps me safe, moves me toward an apple, and maintains flexibility for future moves. Moving toward the apple at (4, 3) seems like a good strategy since it's in the same row as me, making it easier to reach.\n\nLet me double-check if LEFT is safe:\n- My body is at [(8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)]\n- Moving to (7, 3) is not into my own body\n- The enemy snake is at (6, 5), so not into their body either\n- It's within the board boundaries\n\nYes, LEFT is safe.\n\nLEFT<|end_of_box|>",
