No immediate off-board risk.\n- **Self-collision**: Since your snake is just a single segment, moving in any direction won't cause self-collision (no body to collide with).\n- **Enemy collision**: Enemy head is at (3,9). Your head is at (7,2). The closest distance is 5 units in x and 7 units in y, so no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves\nAll four directions are safe:\n- **UP**: Move to (7,3)\n- **DOWN**: Move to (8,2)\n- **LEFT**: Move to (6,2)\n- **RIGHT**: Move to (8,2)\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Apple Proximity and Future Options\n- **UP (7,3)**: No apple nearby. Moving up will keep you in a relatively open space, but not immediately close to any apple.\n- **DOWN (8,2)**: This is adjacent to the apple at (8,2). If you move down, you will eat this apple and grow by 1 segment. This is a good immediate win.\n- **LEFT (6,2)**: No apple nearby. Moving left will keep you in a more open space, but no immediate apple.\n- **RIGHT (8,2)**: This is adjacent to the apple at (8,2). If you move right, you will eat this apple and grow by 1 segment. This is also a good immediate win.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Enemy Movement\nThe enemy snake is at (3,9). It will move this turn. The enemy's body is empty, so it can move in any direction. However, since it has no body, it can move freely without immediate threats to you.\n\n### Step 5: Long-Term Strategy\n- **Grow immediately**: Eating an apple will increase your body length, making you more resilient to future collisions.\n- **Avoid getting trapped**: Moving down or right will place you closer to the apple (8,2) and potentially allow you to explore more of the board in the future.\n\n### Decision\nBoth moving down and right will allow you to eat the apple at (8,2) immediately. Since both are equally good, let's choose to move down to (8,2) for a straightforward and immediate win.\n\n**DOWN**",

Moving here would collide with your own tail immediately.\n2. **DOWN (8, 1)** \u2192 Valid, moves toward `(7, 0)` (high-value apple). No immediate collision risk.\n3. **LEFT (6, 1)** \u2192 Valid, moves away from `(0, 0)` but reduces proximity to `(1,1)`.\n4. **RIGHT (8, 1)** \u2192 Valid, but `(8, 1)` is not occupied by your body. However, this could be a dead-end if the enemy expands toward `(0, 5)`.\n\n#### **Threats & Risks:**\n- **Enemy Expansion:** Snake #0 is expanding toward `(0, 5)`, but it\u2019s far from `(7,1)`. No immediate collision risk unless we move into its path.\n- **Self-Collision:** Moving **UP (7, 2)** is invalid due to tail collision.\n- **Apple Priority:** `(7, 0)` is the closest high-value apple. Moving toward it is safer and keeps options open for future expansion.\n\n#### **Evaluation:**\n- **DOWN (8, 1):** Moves toward `(7, 0)`, a high-value apple. This is the safest and most strategic move to secure `(7, 0)` and avoid future risks.\n- **LEFT (6, 1):** Moves away from `(0, 0)` but reduces priority. Not ideal.\n- **RIGHT (8, 1):** Dead-end if the enemy expands toward `(0, 5)`. Not recommended.\n\n**Best move:** **DOWN (8, 1)** to secure `(7, 0)` and keep options open for future expansion.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n1. **Prioritize `(7, 0)`:** This is the most valuable apple left. Move toward it aggressively to deny the enemy.\n2. **Avoid UP moves:** Moving UP would collide with your tail immediately, which is a no-go.\n3. **Monitor enemy expansion:** If snake #0 reaches `(0, 4)` or `(0, 5)`, block their path by moving toward `(7, 0)` or `(0, 0)`.\n4. **Expand toward `(1, 1)`:** If `(7, 0)` is eaten, prioritize `(1, 1)` next.\n5. **Avoid `(6, 1)` moves:** This could be a dead-end if the enemy expands there.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",
