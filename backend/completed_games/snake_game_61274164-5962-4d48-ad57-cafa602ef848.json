Opens up to cut east later but keeps me away from my own body, and maximizes open area to move.\n\n- RIGHT (3, 3): Safe, moves me closer to center, advancing toward the apples as well. This direction is more direct toward apple cluster, but if I always go right I risk getting \"pinched\" against my own body if not careful.\n\n- DOWN (2, 2): Open, but going down moves me toward my own vacated tail (which may soon move), but doesn't progress me toward apples.\n\n- LEFT (1, 3): Collides with my own body segment! Don't do this.\n\n**Which is best for the immediate goal (apples and safety)?**\n\n- UP (2, 4): Progresses me northward, keeps a buffer from my own trailing body to the west, doesn't reduce lateral movement options, and delays converging too quickly toward the center (since both up and right are open).\n\n- RIGHT (3, 3): Slightly more direct toward (3, 9), but getting higher up first gives more room to adjust later. Also, moving right too soon narrows my southern escape route if I need to escape congestion later.\n\n- With my snake body trailing to my left and below, heading UP keeps me safest and flexible.\n\n**Strategy for future:**\n- Continue moving north (UP) as default, watching for a moment to veer east (RIGHT) when upper half is reached, to approach apples then.\n- Keep checking tail positions to avoid cutting myself off if a right turn is needed later.\n- Monitor for new apples or enemy progress, but for now, the field is wide open.\n\n**Final answer/decided move:**\n**UP**"

UP \u2192 (2, 7)**\n- Safe (nothing blocks it)\n- Brings me toward Y=8/9 apples\n- Next turn can continue UP to (2, 8), then RIGHT for apple access\n- Remains centrally positioned and flexible\n- No threats from enemy\n\n#### **2. RIGHT \u2192 (3, 6)**\n- Safe, clear\n- A slight diagonal up-right is generally good toward apple cluster\n- However, I'm still at Y=6 \u2014 need at least two UPs to reach the apples, and (3, 9) is out of reach for now\n\n#### **3. LEFT \u2192 (1, 6)**\n- Safe, but moves me away from apple cluster and into the southwest gap, which isn't useful now\n\n#### **Down**\n- Instantly fatal (body)\n\n### **Goal**  \nGet apples with minimal risk, keep options open for next few moves. Prioritize (3, 9) unless apple cluster becomes clearly optimal, but head toward the northeast apple cluster.\n\n---\n\n### **Simulate Sequences**\n\n- **If I go UP:**  \n    - (2, 7), then next turn UP or RIGHT  \n    - (3, 9) is 2 cells north, could get close and pivot right to get several apples\n    - Can choose whether to double up toward (3, 9) first, or angle toward the dense apple cluster Y=8\n\n- **If I go RIGHT:**  \n    - (3, 6), still 3 cells away from (3, 9)/(4, 8)\n    - Possibly a bit slower at getting to apples, and less flexible for changing plan\n\n- **LEFT:**  \n    - Moves away from apples\n\n**No new enemy threat.**\n\n---\n\n### **Best Choice**\n**Move UP.**  \n- Most flexible  \n- Near central vertical  \n- Keeps path open both for (3, 9) or the cluster  \n- No threat of self-trapping  \n- On (2, 7), next turn if (3, 9) still open, UP keeps me on path; if apples at (4, 8)/(5, 8) are more open, can pivot RIGHT on following turn.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Turn Strategy (internal note):**\n- If (3, 9) is not under enemy threat, go for (3, 9) via UP.\n- If any of the Y=8 cluster is opening, or (3, 9) is gone, pivot RIGHT from (2, 7) or (2, 8).\n- Always have the option to go UP or RIGHT from next square.\n\n---\n\n## **DECISION**\n\n**Move:**  \n**UP**"

State Recap**\n\n- **Your Head:** (2, 8)\n- **Your Body:** (2, 7), (2, 6)\n- **Your last move:** UP to (2, 8)\n- **Apples:** (4, 8), (5, 7), (3, 9), (5, 8), (1, 1)\n- **Enemy Snake 0:** (7, 8) \u2192 (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9)\n\n### **Your Options (from (2, 8)):**\n- **UP (2, 9):**  \n    - Safe. Empty square. Brings you one cell away (to the south) of apple (3, 9).\n- **RIGHT (3, 8):**  \n    - Safe. Open. Directly toward apple cluster at (4, 8), (5, 8), also brings you closer to the NE apples.\n- **LEFT (1, 8):**  \n    - Safe. Less useful, away from apples.\n- **DOWN (2, 7):**\n    - Fatal. Runs into your own body.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Motivations & Strategy**\n\n### **Current Tactical Analysis**\n\n- **Primary goal:** Grab apples!  \n  - (3, 9) is one square away (right and up).  \n  - (4, 8) one RIGHT away; (5, 8) two RIGHT; (5, 7) two RIGHT + one DOWN.\n- **No enemy threat in direct vicinity.** Enemy snake is constrained to NE corner.\n- **You can still swing to either apple cluster.**\n\n### **UP (2, 9):**\n- Preps for a move to (3, 9) if you then go RIGHT afterward.\n- If (3, 9) gets snapped up, you can then go RIGHT toward (4, 9), or then DOWN/RIGHT for cluster access.\n- But no apple directly at (2, 9).\n\n### **RIGHT (3, 8):**\n- Directly adjacent to an apple at (4, 8).\n- Next move: can take (4, 8) in one step.\n- Also, after (4, 8), you have the choice to go RIGHT (to (5, 8)), or UP (to (4, 9)), or RIGHT/UP for (5, 9).\n\n### **LEFT (1, 8):**\n- No apples that side. Retreats from all apple action.\n- Less flexible.\n\n### **DOWN (2, 7):**\n- Fatal/self-collision.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Simulation for the Following Moves**\n\n### **A. If you go RIGHT to (3, 8):**\n- Next move you can pick up (4, 8) by moving RIGHT.\n- Also positions you for (5, 8)/(5, 7) after that.\n- If (3, 9) remains unclaimed, you can go UP from (4, 8) to (4, 9), then LEFT to (3, 9).\n- ENEMY snake is not close enough to contest (4, 8)/(5, 8) before you, so you can likely get there first.\n\n### **B. If you go UP to (2, 9):**\n- Next move you can go RIGHT to (3, 9) (picking up the apple at (3, 9) if not gone).\n- You are not immediately collecting apples, while the cluster to your right offers multiple quick gains.\n\n### **C. RIGHT is likely optimal:**\n- You'll reach edible apples faster, with consecutive picks possible.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Final Decision**\n\n### **RIGHT (3, 8):**\n- Safest and most apple-productive.\n- If apple at (4, 8) is still available, grab it next turn.\n- Maintain flexibility; after eating (4, 8), consider which apple is available (move toward (5, 8) or UP for (4, 9)).\n- The enemy cannot threaten this cluster before you get there.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Next Turn Strategy Note (for yourself):**\n- **Check if any apples in the right cluster are taken.**\n- **Default plan:** After RIGHT to (3, 8), move RIGHT to (4, 8) to grab the apple.  \n    - Then continue moving right or up, depending on which apple remains and enemy position.\n- **If path is blocked ahead, consider moving UP for (3, 9).**\n- **Always avoid doubling back (2, 7): fatal.**\n\n---\n\n## **DECISION**\n\n**Move:**  \n**RIGHT**"

(Assume classic Snake behavior\u2014collision = death.)\n- **DANGER: Not a safe move.**\n\n### 2. **LEFT (to (3, 8))**\n- That's your own recent body block from last move. Going back into yourself.\n- **ILLEGAL: Collides with yourself.**\n\n### 3. **UP (to (4, 9))**\n- There is an apple at (4, 9).\n- That spot is empty; safe and rewards a point + grows you.\n\n### 4. **DOWN (to (4, 7))**\n- That spot is empty, but there's no apple there.\n- Might be useful for repositioning if needed.\n\n## **Evaluating the Threat**\n- The enemy snake's head is **immediately to your right** at (5, 8).\n- If you move UP to (4, 9), you get an apple and keep away from the enemy.\n- If you move DOWN, you can try to approach the cluster at (5, 7) later, but you miss an immediate apple.\n\n## **Best Move**\n- RIGHT: Fatal (enemy head).\n- LEFT: Fatal (your own body).\n- DOWN: Safe, but no apple.\n- UP: Safe, apple at (4, 9).\n\n**Therefore:**\n> **UP (to (4, 9))** is the optimal move: clear, immediate apple, grow, and maintain safety.\n\n---\n\n## **Next Turn Strategy**\n- After moving to (4, 9):\n    - Enemy remains on the right (potentially moves into (5, 9) or down).\n    - Options open: \n        - LEFT to (3, 9): another apple there.\n        - DOWN to (4, 8): your own body will have vacated, due to growth, so extremely likely to be safe.\n        - RIGHT to (5, 9): possible, but depends on enemy movement.\n    - Consider chess-like \"tail\" awareness to avoid self-trap after growth.\n\n**Watch enemy movements. After the move UP, try to string apples (e.g., LEFT to (3, 9) if safe, otherwise reevaluate).**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Move**\n\n**UP**\n\n---\n\n**(Next turn: Evaluate left to (3, 9) apple, down to (4, 8), and enemy's position.)**"

Probably at (5, 8) or one step up if enemy went up.\n- Apples: (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 5), **no longer (4, 9)**, (4, 3)\n\nVisual excerpt (top section):\n\n 9 . . . A 1 . . T T .\n 8 . . T T T T T T . .\n 7 . . . . . 0 . . . .\n\n### **My Immediate Choices from (4, 9):**\n- **UP:** (4, 10): Off the board \u2192 **DEATH**\n- **DOWN:** (4, 8): Would be my own body, but since I just grew, my tail is at (2, 8). So, after this move, (2, 8) will vacate, meaning (4, 8) is still part of my body (I grew, so tail doesn't move). So DOWN to (4, 8) would mean moving into my own body \u2192 **DEATH**\n- **LEFT:** (3, 9): There's an apple there! Is it safe? Let's check:\n    - Is (3, 9) occupied by anyone else? Enemy snake was previously at (5, 8) and its segments trailed right and then up; no indication it's near (3, 9).\n    - (3, 9) is not a part of my own body. **SAFE**\n    - Apple there, so I'd grow and get another point.\n- **RIGHT:** (5, 9): Top edge, not off the board. What's there?\n    - The enemy's tail used to point up to (8, 9), but unless enemy moved up, (5, 9) is likely empty.\n    - But enemy's head was at (5, 8) last move; possible it could go UP into (5, 9) at the same time as me, risking a head-to-head? If simultaneous and equal-length, both die; if longer, longer survives.\n        - Enemy is longer than me (they had 6 total blocks from the earlier body). Head-to-head, I die.\n\n### **Summary Table**\n| Move    | Destination | Apple? | Enemy risk?        | Self-risk?           | Safe?  |\n|---------|-------------|--------|---------------------|-----------------------|--------|\n| UP      | (4, 10)     | -      | Off board           | DIE                   | No     |\n| DOWN    | (4, 8)      | -      | N/A                 | Into own body         | No     |\n| LEFT    | (3, 9)      | Yes    | None (safe)         | None                  | **Yes**|\n| RIGHT   | (5, 9)      | No     | Enemy head possible | None                  | Risky  |\n\n### **Best Move Reasoning**\n- **LEFT to (3, 9)** is clearly the best:\n    - There's an apple, get a point, grow.\n    - No risk from enemy or wall.\n- **RIGHT** is tempting if we wanted to pressure the enemy or snag that corridor, but it's too risky given the possibility of an enemy head collision (and they're longer).\n\n### **Next Turn Considerations**\n- After taking (3, 9), next apples: none immediately nearby, so might want to consider retreating or looking for safe corridors.\n- Watch enemy location closely; avoid meeting their head.\n\n---\n\n### **Move**\n**LEFT**\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**  \nContinue prioritizing apples, but after (3, 9) consider safest direction to avoid conflict with Snake #0. Possibly move DOWN or RIGHT if safe, and re-evaluate based on enemy movement.\n\n**Final decision:**  \n**LEFT**"

Next Turn Consideration**\n- After a DOWN move, can choose to move further LEFT, or continue DOWN, depending on snake locations and apple paths.\n- If enemy isn't closing in, keep progressing toward apples\u2014favor survival, pathing, and staying clear of both snakes' bodies.\n- Keep an eye on possible escapes from the wall.\n\n---\n\n## **Decision:**\n\n**MOVE: DOWN**\n\n- (2,8) is being vacated (tail moves forward), so is vacant after this step.\n- DOWN gives more future flexibility than sticking to top edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Note to Myself**\n- After (2,8), check (1,8) for safe moves to descend left wall toward (1,1), but remain flexible\u2014avoid pinning myself against the wall if enemy starts approaching or apples are eaten.\n- Always check for body vacating before moving to recently-trailed squares.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**  \n**DOWN**"

Strategic Goal**\n\n- **Apple proximity:**  \n    - **(4,3)** is the closest apple that lies straight south-east; moving RIGHT could get me heading that way.\n    - **(1,1)** is far bottom left; moving LEFT could start me on a path to this.\n    - **(3,9), (4,9)** are way up at the top and require passing by my own previous tail, possibly dangerous and slow.  \n    - **(7,5)** is enemy-proximal (avoid for now).\n\n- **Enemy Proximity:** Enemy snake is in the upper right, not a factor for a few turns.\n\n- **Body placement:**  \n    - My own tail is at (4,7), so moving RIGHT now (to 3,6) is not moving towards my own body, it's safe.\n    - UP is blocked by my own body.\n\n- **Future Flexibility:**  \n    - DOWN and RIGHT both open up paths toward apples, but RIGHT puts me closer to (4,3) (which is nearer and more accessible than (1,1)).\n    - LEFT heads me to the left edge, where there\u2019s no nearby apple, and doesn\u2019t set me up for escaping if needed.\n    - DOWN heads towards (4,3), but more circuitously than RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Move Analysis**\n\n#### **DOWN (2,5):**\n- Safe.\n- Keeps me away from the top wall.\n- Opens potential future LEFT/RIGHT options.\n- But takes me more directly towards (1,1), but that\u2019s farther than (4,3).\n\n#### **LEFT (1,6):**\n- Safe.\n- Moves towards (1,1), but takes me to a corner. \n\n#### **RIGHT (3,6):**\n- Safe.\n- Moves closer to (4,3) apple (which is \u201conly\u201d 1 right, then 3 down).\n- Also eventually puts (3,9) and (4,9) in range (if accessible before enemy).\n- Area ahead is clear.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Decide**\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6)** is optimal for:\n    - Maximizing shortest path to most accessible apple (4,3).\n    - Future flexibility: can go DOWN next turn, or RIGHT again if needed.\n    - Avoiding unnecessary left-wall entrapment.\n    - Keeping enemy in the periphery (no immediate threat from the east).\n    - Board shows open area in that direction.\n\n**Self-strategy for next turn:**  \n- Continue toward (4,3). Check if enemy maneuvers toward center, in case of path conflict.\n- If apple gets eaten, adjust toward next shortest apple, still maintaining escape flexibility and avoiding tight clustering with own/other snake\u2019s body.\n- Keep an eye on available escape routes\u2014never fully lock in to a wall unless escape is guaranteed.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Decision:**  \n**RIGHT**\n\n---\n\n**Move:** **RIGHT**\n\n---"

Move Implications**\n\n### **RIGHT (4,6):**\n- **Safe.**\n- Moves my head closer to (4,3) both in x and (once ready) y.\n- No threat ahead for at least one turn, as far as visible.\n\n### **DOWN (3,5):**\n- **Safe.**\n- Puts me under (4,6), close to target path to (4,3), but keeps me one step short in x.\n- If I go DOWN now, then RIGHT (to 4,5), then DOWN (to 4,4), then DOWN (to 4,3): this path is valid. \n    - However, unless (4,6) becomes blocked in the next move, moving RIGHT keeps overall options open and doesn't constrain future moves.\n\n- **Which is better for (4,3)?**  \n    - Either sequence is viable:\n        - RIGHT \u2192 DOWN \u2192 DOWN \u2192 DOWN (4,6 \u2192 4,5 \u2192 4,4 \u2192 4,3)  \n        - DOWN \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 DOWN \u2192 DOWN (3,5 \u2192 4,5 \u2192 4,4 \u2192 4,3)\n\n    - Current area is clear, so RIGHT is preferable: it gives slightly more options, since after RIGHT, both DOWN and more RIGHT are open (barring a surprise encroachment from another snake).\n\n---\n\n## **6. Avoiding Trap**\n\n- By continuing RIGHT, I don\u2019t end up boxed in, and can always move DOWN later.\n- If I go DOWN now, and for some reason (enemy/sudden constraint) I can't go RIGHT, my options become more limited and more leftward (away from apples).\n\n---\n\n## **7. Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- If apples remain, continue toward (4,3).\n- If apple at (4,3) is eaten (by enemy or me), evaluate closest apple, with a bias against chasing top apples unless the board is clear.\n- Keep out of tight corridors and ensure minimum two available safe next moves at any time.\n- Continue to avoid enemy snake for now.\n\n---\n\n## **8.

Updated Position**\n\n- **My head:** (4,6)  \n- **My body:** [(3,6), (2,6), (2,7)]  \n- I just moved rightward onto (4,6); my body follows behind.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Valid Moves**\n\nLet's examine my neighboring squares:\n\n- **UP (4,7):**\n    - Is it occupied? Enemy snake body is at (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), but not (4,7).\n    - Is any own body here? [(3,6), (2,6), (2,7)] \u2014\u00a0no.\n    - **SAFE**\n- **DOWN (4,5):**\n    - Is it occupied? Let's check: my own body \u2014\u00a0none here; enemy \u2014\u00a0none.\n    - **SAFE**\n- **LEFT (3,6):**\n    - Is it occupied? That's my own body, just left behind me.\n    - **NOT SAFE**\n- **RIGHT (5,6):**\n    - Is it occupied? Let's check: my body \u2014\u00a0no; enemy \u2014\u00a0(7,6) and (7,5) are occupied, but (5,6) is not.\n    - **SAFE**\n\n---\n\n## **3. Apple Locations**\n\n- (3,9) \u2014\u00a0(4,6) \u2192 UP3, LEFT1 \u2014\u00a0distance 4\n- (4,9) \u2014\u00a0(4,6) \u2192 UP3 \u2014\u00a0distance 3\n- (4,3) \u2014\u00a0(4,6) \u2192 DOWN3 \u2014\u00a0distance 3\n- (1,1), (4,1) \u2014 both much further\n\nSo, options:\n\n- (4,3) \u2014\u00a0three downs from here\n- (4,9) \u2014\u00a0three ups from here\n\nComparing threat: (4,7) is the first move UP, (4,5) for DOWN. Both are safe, but if I go UP, eventually the path goes near enemy territory (looking at board, (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)), so that path gets hazardous.\n\nDOWN stays clear of the enemy and brings me closer to (4,3), which is away from combat.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Threat Evaluation**\n\n- Enemy snake head is at (7,4). Their body is at (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8).\n- Their path hugs the right and top side, trending up at (5,8).\n- They are not close to contest the apples below.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Move Implications**\n\n### **UP (4,7):**\n- **Safe.**\n- Brings me toward (4,9) apple (one of the two at the top).\n- However, above is a corridor ending with enemy body at (5,7), (6,7), (7,7): as I climb up, I could get boxed in with limited lateral options, especially if the enemy loops back.\n- Risky, given body congestion.\n\n### **RIGHT (5,6):**\n- **Safe.**\n- This would let me approach enemy zone and potentially the corridor (\"snake routes\") of enemy body at (5,7).\n- Not directly helping for (4,3) apple, nor reducing risk.\n\n### **DOWN (4,5):**\n- **Safe.**\n- Moves toward (4,3) apple; a direct, open shot with no immediate blockers.\n- Area is open and away from enemy, easier to maneuver if something changes.\n\n### **LEFT (3,6):**\n- **Not safe (my body).**\n\n---\n\n## **6. Best Path**\n\n- The direct DOWN to (4,3) route is open and safe for now.\n- After DOWN, I can proceed with:\n    - DOWN (4,5) \u2192 DOWN (4,4) \u2192 DOWN (4,3) to grab the apple if it\u2019s still there.\n- Only possibility that could hinder this route is if an enemy knocks into this area very soon (unlikely) or I'm forced to divert due to my own tail, which isn't a risk at the moment.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Future Planning**\n\n- After eating the apple at (4,3) (if available), reevaluate remaining apples \u2014\u00a0potentially aim for (4,1) or return upward if the top apples still remain uncontested.\n- Watch for enemy movement after apple collection; avoid areas of high congestion.\n\n---\n\n## **Next Move**\n\n**Decision:**  \n- Move **DOWN** to (4,5), as this is the safest, least-congested, and most direct path to an apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Self-Strategy For Next Turn**\n- Continue pressing DOWN if still clear (towards (4,3)); always check adjacent spaces for sudden threats.\n- If apple is gone (collected by another snake), reevaluate apple targets with a bias for safe, uncontested areas.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \n**DOWN**"

Enemy Snake Position\n\n- Nearest enemy head: (7,3)\n- Enemy body blocks the RIGHT edge (coordinates (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)), mostly up and right from me.\n\n### 3.

Path to Apples\n\n- The apple at (4,3) is two steps straight DOWN:\n    - (4,5) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (4,3)\n- No blocker below me (quick check for body/enemy), and it's uncontested by enemy given enemy is far right.\n\n#### Alternative apples:\n- (1,1), (4,1): would need to go DOWN and then LEFT/RIGHT \u2014 longer, less direct.\n- Top apples: currently less attractive (potential congestion).\n\n### 6. Threats\n\n- Enemy snake is not near my immediate path downwards.\n- My own tail is far behind and will move along with me, so no immediate self-blocking.\n\n### 7. Best Move & Rationale\n\n**DOWN to (4,4):**\n- Safest, most direct route to a nearby apple (4,3).\n- Avoids congestion, stays in open territory.\n- Next turn, will repeat this logic, moving DOWN to (4,3) for the apple, unless situation changes (apple taken, new threat).\n\n### 8. Backup Move\n\nIf suddenly blocked below (which can't happen this turn), I'd check left (3,5) and right (5,5), but currently, DOWN remains best.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy Note to Myself for Next Turn:**\n- Continue moving DOWN to catch apple at (4,3).\n- After eating, most logical apples are likely (4,1) or (1,1) \u2014\u00a0follow whichever is safer and closer.\n- Always check for emerging threats, especially from enemy movement or my own tail's new positions.\n\n---\n\n**Final Move:**  \n**DOWN**"

My Current Position\n\n- My head was at (4,5) last turn, but I'm now at (4,4) (since I moved DOWN).\n- My body should have shifted down as well. Let's recalculate:\n    - Previous: head (4,5), body [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6)].\n    - Now (after moving DOWN): head at (4,4); new body: (4,5), (4,6), (3,6).\n    - Snake tail is leaving (2,6), now reads:  \n      [(4,4) (head), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)].\n\n## 2. Apples\n\n- (4,3) is immediately below me\u2014if I go DOWN again, I can eat it this turn.\n- (1,1) and (4,1) are at the bottom, further away.\n- (3,9), (4,9) are at top, but require a long journey.\n\n## 3. Threat Check\n\n#### Immediate surroundings from (4,4):\n- UP: (4,5) \u2013 my own body. NOT SAFE.\n- DOWN: (4,3) \u2013 apple. No bodies here; board confirms open. SAFE.\n- LEFT: (3,4) \u2013 open space.\n- RIGHT: (5,4) \u2013 open space.\n\nNo immediate threat from enemy snakes: #0's head is still over at (7,2) and not near.\n\n## 4. Plan\n\n### Apple at (4,3) is ours for the taking:\n- If I go DOWN, I eat the apple.\n- Growing means my tail won\u2019t shrink: after this move, my snake will be length 5.\n- That's good for points and keeps me away from congestion.\n\n### Check for sudden risks:\n- Any risk of boxing myself in after eating apple at (4,3)?\n    - (4,2) is open (and so are (3,3), (5,3)). Space below seems clear.\n    - No enemy snake nor my own body close enough to be a threat.\n\n## 5. Alternative Moves?\n\nIf for some reason moving DOWN wasn\u2019t possible, LEFT or RIGHT would both be open (to (3,4) or (5,4)), but neither delivers an apple. Staying on course is best.\n\n## 6. Next-Turn Strategy\n\n- After eating the (4,3) apple: assess which is closer/safest between (4,1) and (1,1).\n- If possible, continue going DOWN for (4,1). If blocked or dangerous, L-shaped LEFT (towards (1,1)).\n- Continually scan for where the enemy snake is going, but currently, they're distant.\n\n---\n\n## DECISION\n\n**Move: DOWN** (to (4,3), eating the apple).\n\n**Next-turn note to myself:** After eating this apple, check safety of continuing DOWN toward (4,1). If safe, go for it; otherwise, veer LEFT toward (1,1). Remain aware of enemy position and my growing tail.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**\n**DOWN**"

Current Position and Body\n\n- My head is at (4,3) (I just moved DOWN onto the apple).\n- My new body (since I grew) will be:  \n  [(4,3) (head), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)]\n- Snake length: 5\n\n## 2. Apple Locations\n\nApples remaining at:\n- (3,9)\n- (1,1)\n- (4,9)\n- (4,1)\n- (2,0)\n\nRelevant apples for me:  \n- (4,1): straight below me (down to y=1).\n- (1,1): left and down.\n- (2,0): far left and down.\n\nTop apples (3,9 and 4,9) are a long journey.\n\n## 3. Immediate Surroundings\n\nFrom (4,3):\n- UP: (4,4) \u2013 MY OWN BODY (just left), NOT SAFE.\n- DOWN: (4,2)\n    - Is it empty? I need to check the board at (4,2).\n\nReferring to board (row y=2, column x=4):  \n` 2 . . . . . . . T 0 .`  \nSo at (4,2): the cell is . (open). Enemy snake (0) is at (8,2) and tail at (7,2), so not near me.\n\n- LEFT: (3,3) \u2013 is . (open space).\n- RIGHT: (5,3) \u2013 is . (open space).\n\nSo, immediate options:\n- DOWN is open, gets me toward next apple at (4,1).\n- LEFT/RIGHT are open as well.\n- UP is blocked by my own body.\n\n## 4. Threats\n\n- Enemy snake is still far away (over at right side).\n- My own body is behind/above me, so not an issue unless I curl back.\n\n## 5. Best Path to Apple\n\n### Closest apple is (4,1)\n- I am at (4,3).\n- Path: DOWN to (4,2), then DOWN to (4,1) (apple).\n- No hazards in that path.\n\n### Any reason not to go DOWN?\n- NONE. Path is totally open. No snake bodies or walls.\n\n### Could an enemy threaten (4,1) or (4,2)?\n- No; enemy is nowhere close.\n\n## 6. Alternatives\n\nLEFT or RIGHT would just move me away from apples.\nUP would be suicide.\n\n## 7. Next-Turn Planning\n\n- Goal: Move DOWN toward (4,1) and eat second apple.\n- After that, re-assess: (1,1) (left), or other apples (depending on enemy/board).\n\n## 8. Final Risk Check\n\n- DOUBLE-CHECK: Will my own tail ever block me?  \nAfter this move (DOWN to (4,2)), my tail will be at (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3).  \nSo, as I move further DOWN, I'm not crossing my own path.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE TO MYSELF\n\nAfter reaching (4,1) and eating that apple next turn, consider LEFT to (3,1) toward (1,1), unless an enemy threatens or unless more apples appear. Keep tracking the enemy's position!\n\n---\n\n**DECISION:**  \n**Move: DOWN** (to (4,2))\n\n**My move:**  \n**DOWN**"

Not a wall.  \n- **DOWN (1,0):** Empty. Not a wall.  \n- **RIGHT (2,1):** My own body \u2013 not allowed.  \n- **UP (1,2):** Empty. Leads toward apple at (0,2).\n\n## 3. **Risk and Opportunity Assessment**\n- **LEFT (0,1):**\n    - Safe move, but wall will be reached after one more step.\n    - From there, only UP or DOWN available; both are safe with no immediate obstacles.\n    - Could be a route towards (0,2) apple via UP.\n- **DOWN (1,0):**\n    - Safe. Leads closer to apple at (2,0).  \n    - Afterward, only LEFT (0,0, empty) or RIGHT (2,0, apple!) from (1,0).\n    - (1,0) is safe, and moves from there appear clear.\n- **UP (1,2):**\n    - Safe, not an immediate apple but brings me closer to (0,2).\n    - From there, can go LEFT (0,2, apple), or continue UP, etc.\n\n## 4. **Strategic Analysis**\n- **LEFT:** Goes along the wall, which can limit escape options, but also produces a tight loop if needed.\n- **DOWN:** Sets up for quick access to apple at (2,0) next turn (by moving RIGHT).\n    - This path also helps avoid walling myself in. However, moving downward means I'll be in the corner row, so need to check for future escape.\n    - Let's double-check: If I go DOWN to (1,0), then RIGHT to (2,0) for the apple, from there I have:\n        - UP (2,1): My old path \u2013 might be clear by next round (tail moves).\n        - LEFT (1,0): Just came from there.\n        - RIGHT (3,0): Empty.\n        - DOWN: Wall.\n    - So after grabbing (2,0), I should be able to head up or right to leave the corner.\n\n- **UP:** Moves toward (0,2), but leaves the other apple (2,0) on the ground. (2,0) is a low competition apple and can be grabbed quickly.\n\n## 5. **Enemy Snake Threat**\n- Still far; no immediate competition for these apples or direct pathing concerns.\n\n## 6. **Best Move?**\nGiven all the above:\n- **DOWN** to (1,0) lets me grab an easy apple next turn at (2,0) with little risk, and the escape routes remain open.\n- **LEFT** is safe but not as rewarding right away.\n- **UP** is viable as a long-term play for (0,2), but priority is close apples.\n\n### **Strategy Reminder for Next Turn:**\n- After taking DOWN to (1,0), plan to RIGHT to (2,0) for apple, then decide: up for (2,1) (if clear), right (3,0), or left (1,0) depending on body and tail clearances.\n- Keep watching for how body tail clears as I grow, especially to avoid trapping myself in the lower left corner.\n\n---\n\n## **DECIDED NEXT MOVE:**  \n**DOWN**"

Empty, legal.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Strategic Analysis:**\n\n### **RIGHT (2,0):**\n- Will eat apple at (2,0). I grow longer by 1.\n- Next move options from (2,0) will be:\n    - UP (2,1): My body's at (2,1) now, but if my tail moves it may open up, depending on where tail is after growing.\n    - RIGHT (3,0): Empty, legal.\n    - LEFT (1,0): Just came from, but will be part of my body next round.\n    - DOWN: Off board.\n- Should check if the body will leave room for head to escape after eating and growing.\n\n- Body sequence after move, assuming I just grew:\n    - Head will be at (2,0); body: [(2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\n- After eating, my tail will not move this turn (since growing), so the square behind stays occupied another turn.\n\n### **LEFT (0,0):**\n- Empty, legal.\n- After that, can only move UP (0,1) or RIGHT (1,0) next turn.\n- Not toward any apple right now, though (0,2) is \"up\" two steps ahead.\n- No immediate reward; misses chance to get the easy (2,0) apple.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Enemy Snake Threat?**\n- Still far away.

(Going UP would hit my own body; LEFT is my segment from this turn; DOWN is wall.)\n    - From (3,0), can then go UP (3,1), which is open.\n    - So, escape is possible and not a problem.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Best Move?**\n\n**RIGHT** to (2,0) grabs a free apple, and the escape path is justified (afterward: RIGHT to (3,0), then UP to (3,1), then could consider making a route to apples at (0,2), (3,9), etc).\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Strategy for Next Turn:**  \n- After moving RIGHT and eating the apple at (2,0), plan to go RIGHT to (3,0), then likely UP to (3,1), surveying whether to loop left for (0,2) or snake upward for the far upper apples.\n- Reassess after each move to avoid closing off escape options as my body grows.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move:**  \n**RIGHT**\n\n---\n\n### _To summarize:_  \n- Immediate apple to the RIGHT (2,0), safe escape options, minimal risk.\n- Preferred move: **RIGHT**"
