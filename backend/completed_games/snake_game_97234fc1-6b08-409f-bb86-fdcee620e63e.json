(0,4) is 2 steps away via LEFT then LEFT. LEFT keeps multiple follow-up moves available (I can go to (0,4) or divert to (1,3) or move up/down), and it doesn\u2019t put me into a trap along the wall because I have vertical escape routes.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (1,4), then LEFT to (0,4) to eat the apple. After growing, prioritize safety and gathering the cluster of nearby apples ((1,3), (2,1), (5,4)) while avoiding head-on engagement with the enemy near the top of the board.

          "rationale": "**Analysis of Turn 0:**\n\nMy head is at (4,8). My body is empty (length 1). The enemy snake (#1) is at (2,4) with no body.\nApples are scattered. The immediate vicinity around (4,8) is:\n- Up (4,9): Empty (according to the board grid, row 9 shows \". . A . A...\" so (4,9) is Empty). Wait, looking at the grid:\n  Row 9: `9 . . A . A . . . . .`\n  X coords 0-9.\n  0: ., 1: ., 2: A, 3: ., 4: A, 5: ., 6: ., 7: ., 8: ., 9: .\n  So (4,9) is an Apple (A at index 4).\n  Wait, the provided text \"Apples at:\" lists (4,9).\n  So (4,9) is an Apple.\n\nLet's list the moves and their safety:\n1.  **UP to (4,9)**:\n    -   Coordinates: Valid (0-9).\n    -   Is it my body? No (body empty).\n    -   Is it enemy body? No (enemy body empty).\n    -   Is it enemy head? Enemy is at (2,4). No.\n    -   Result: Safe. Collects an apple. Length becomes 2.\n    -   Future options: From (4,9), I am at the top edge. I can go Down to (4,8) (my current spot, but I'll have moved, so it will be empty? No, if I eat, I grow. My tail stays at (4,8) effectively? No, for length 1 -> 2, the tail moves to the previous head position. So if I move UP to (4,9), my new body will be [(4,9), (4,8)].\n    -   From (4,9), I can go Left (3,9), Right (5,9), or Down (4,8). Down is my own body (tail). So I cannot go Down. I have 2 safe options (Left/Right) usually.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4,7)**:\n    -   Coordinates: Valid.\n    -   Is it my body? No.\n    -   Is it enemy body? No.\n    -   Is it enemy head? Enemy at (2,4). No.\n    -   Is it an apple? Board shows row 7: `7 . . A . . . . . . .`. (4,7) is Empty.\n    -   Result: Safe. No apple. Length stays 1.\n    -   Future options: From (4,7), I have 4 neighbors. Up (4,8) (empty after move), Down (4,6), Left (3,7), Right (5,7).\n    -   (4,6): Row 6 `6 . . . . . . . . A .`. (4,6) is Empty.\n    -   (3,7): Row 7 (3,7) is Empty.\n    -   (5,7): Row 7 (5,7) is Empty.\n    -   Looks very open.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3,8)**:\n    -   Coordinates: Valid.\n    -   Safe? Yes.\n    -   Apple? No (Row 8: `8 . . . . 0 . . A . .`. (3,8) is Empty).\n    -   Future options: Open. (3,7) is empty, (3,9) is empty, (2,8) is empty, (4,8) is my old spot (empty next turn).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5,8)**:\n    -   Coordinates: Valid.\n    -   Safe? Yes.\n    -   Apple? No.\n    -   Future options: (5,7) empty, (5,9) empty, (6,8) empty.\n\n**Strategy & Safety:**\nEnemy snake is at (2,4). Distance from me (4,8) is dx=2, dy=4. It's not an immediate threat for a head-on collision unless we move towards each other. I can't predict its move.\nHowever, I must survive.\nMy immediate goal is to eat apples and grow. Eating early is good.\nThe Apple at (4,9) is right above me. It is safe to take.\nTaking it puts me at (4,9) with length 2.\nFrom (4,9), I must be careful not to trap myself.\nMy body will be (4,8).\nIf I go UP to (4,9), I am at the top row.\nNext turn (Turn 1), I must go Left, Right, or Down.\nDown is (4,8), which is my tail. I can move into my tail because it moves away? No, rules say \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" and \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die.\"\nWait, usually in Snake, the tail moves forward, so the cell becomes empty.\nBUT, if I am at (4,9) and my body is [(4,9), (4,8)], and I move Down to (4,8).\nThe body moves: Head to (4,8). The tail (4,8) moves to... wait, if I grow, the tail stays.\nIf I ate an apple, my length is 2.\nCurrent state: Head (4,8), Tail (4,8).\nAfter move UP: Head (4,9), Tail (4,8).\nNext turn, if I move DOWN: Head (4,8).\nIs (4,8) part of my body? Yes, it's the tail.\nDoes the tail move before the head checks? In simultaneous movement, the tail usually vacates the cell as the head enters.\nHowever, rules state: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nThe cell behind my head at (4,9) is (4,8).\nIf I move DOWN to (4,8), I am moving into the cell directly behind my head.\nThis is explicitly forbidden: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nSo, if I go UP to (4,9), I cannot go DOWN next turn. I must go Left or Right.\nLeft (3,9) and Right (5,9) are both safe and valid (board size 10, so 0-9).\nSo I will not be trapped.\n\nIs there a better move?\nMaybe going DOWN to (4,7) to open up more space?\n(4,7) is empty. Apples nearby: (5,4) is far. (4,9) is far (Up).\nIf I go DOWN to (4,7), I am safe.\nIf I go UP to (4,9), I eat an apple immediately. Score 1-0.\nGetting an early lead is good.\nAlso, eating grows the snake, which is the objective.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"Backwards\" rule.\nIf I go UP to (4,9):\nMy body is [(4,9), (4,8)].\nNext turn, moving DOWN to (4,8) is \"moving directly backwards into your own body\".\nSo I cannot do that.\nI can go LEFT to (3,9) or RIGHT to (5,9).\n(3,9) is empty.\n(5,9) is empty.\nSo I have 2 safe moves from (4,9).\nThis is acceptable.\n\nWhat if I go DOWN to (4,7)?\nNext turn I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nUP (4,8) is empty.\nDOWN (4,6) is empty.\nLEFT (3,7) is empty.\nRIGHT (5,7) is empty.\nThis gives me 4 options.\nHowever, I miss the apple at (4,9). The enemy might take it? The enemy is at (2,4). To get to (4,9), it takes time. But apples are shared.\nIf I don't take it, it's there for me later, but I lose points now.\nThe prompt says: \"Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both: * increase your chance of safely eating apples...\"\nTaking the apple is preferred.\n\nWhat about the enemy?\nEnemy is at (2,4). Apples near enemy: (2,7) is Up. (2,1) is Down. (4,4) is Right (but that's A? No, (4,4) is Empty. Wait, grid row 4: `4 A . 1 . . A . . . A`. (4,4) is Empty.\nThe enemy is likely to move towards an apple. (2,7) is close. (2,1) is close.\n(4,9) is far from enemy.\nSo (4,9) is relatively safe from enemy contention immediately.\nHowever, I should watch out for head-on collisions.\nIf I move UP to (4,9).\nIf enemy moves Right to (3,4).\nNo collision.\nIf enemy moves UP to (2,5).\nNo collision.\nI am at (4,8). Enemy at (2,4).\nIf I move UP, enemy moves UP, we are far apart.\nIf I move UP, enemy moves RIGHT, we are far apart.\nIf I move UP, enemy moves DOWN, far apart.\nIf I move UP, enemy moves LEFT (off board or wall? (1,4) is valid).\nWe are not colliding.\n\nIs there any trap?\nMy head is at (4,8).\nIf I go UP to (4,9), I am at the edge.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8) or RIGHT to (5,8) or DOWN to (4,7), I am more central.\nCentral is usually better for options.\nHowever, (4,9) is an apple.\nLet's check the board state for walls or traps.\nBoard is 10x10. No walls mentioned.\nMy snake length 1.\nEnemy length 1.\n\nHypothesis: I move UP to (4,9).\nI eat the apple.\nNext turn, I can go LEFT to (3,9) or RIGHT to (5,9).\nSuppose I go LEFT to (3,9).\nFrom (3,9), I can go LEFT (2,9) or DOWN (3,8) or RIGHT (4,9).\n(4,9) is my tail (if I grew). If I eat, length 2. After moving to (3,9), my body is [(3,9), (4,9)].\nFrom (3,9), DOWN is (3,8). Is (3,8) empty? Yes.\nLEFT is (2,9). Is (2,9) empty? Grid row 9: `9 . . A . A . . . . .`. (2,9) is 'A' (Apple).\nSo from (3,9), I can go LEFT to (2,9) and eat another apple.\nThis looks like a good path: (4,8) -> (4,9) -> (3,9) -> (2,9).\n(2,9) is an apple.\nFrom (2,9), I can go DOWN to (2,8) or LEFT to (1,9) or RIGHT to (3,9) (tail).\n(2,8) is empty.\n(1,9) is empty.\nSo this path is safe and productive.\n\nAlternative path: DOWN to (4,7).\nFrom (4,7), I can go DOWN to (4,6) or LEFT to (3,7).\n(4,6) is empty.\n(3,7) is empty.\nNo immediate apple.\nWhy would I avoid the apple at (4,9)?\nOnly if it traps me.\nBut I found a valid escape route (Left to (3,9)).\nSo taking the apple is safe and profitable.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves to (4,9)?\nEnemy is at (2,4). Distance to (4,9) is dx=2, dy=5. Total 7 moves.\nMy distance is 1 move.\nI will be there first.\nEven if I don't eat it, I shouldn't let the enemy eat it easily, but I should prioritize my own survival and points.\n\nLet's double check the \"Moving directly backwards\" rule.\nIf I go UP to (4,9). Head (4,9), Body [(4,9), (4,8)].\nNext turn, if I go DOWN to (4,8).\nThis is the cell behind the head.\nRule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nSo I must not go DOWN.\nI must go LEFT or RIGHT.\nLeft (3,9) is empty.\nRight (5,9) is empty.\nI am safe.\n\nWhat if I am blocked Left and Right?\nI am not. (3,9) and (5,9) are empty.\nSo I am safe.\n\nIs there any other danger?\nHead-on collision?\nIf I move UP to (4,9).\nEnemy moves UP to (2,5).\nNo collision.\nIf Enemy moves UP twice? No, only one move per turn.\nIf I move UP to (4,9), and Enemy moves... to (4,9)?\nImpossible in one turn.\n\nDecision: UP is safe, eats an apple, and leads to a clear path for the next turn.\n\nWait, let's look at the board again.\n` 9 . . A . A . . . . .`\nAt (4,9) is 'A'. Correct.\nAt (5,9) is '.'.\nAt (3,9) is '.'.\nWait, (2,9) is 'A'.\nSo from (4,9) -> (3,9) -> (2,9) is a sequence of moves where I eat two apples in 3 turns? (Turn 0: to (4,9), Turn 1: to (3,9), Turn 2: to (2,9)).\nWait, Turn 0: Move to (4,9), Eat.\nTurn 1: Move to (3,9). (4,9) becomes tail. (2,9) is Apple.\nTurn 2: Move to (2,9), Eat.\nThis is very good.\n\nLet's consider the DOWN move (4,7) again.\nFrom (4,7), can I get to (2,9)? Yes, but further away.\n(4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7).\n(2,7) is an Apple (Row 7: `7 . . A ...`).\nSo (2,7) is an apple.\nPath: (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7).\nTurn 0: Move to (4,7).\nTurn 1: Move to (3,7).\nTurn 2: Move to (2,7).\nThis also eats an apple in 3 turns.\nPath A: (4,8) -> (4,9) -> (3,9) -> (2,9). (Eat at T0, Eat at T2).\nPath B: (4,8) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7). (Eat at T2).\n\nPath A gives me a point immediately.\nPath A puts me at (4,9) (edge).\nPath B puts me at (4,7) (interior).\n\nInterior is usually better for flexibility.\nBut (4,9) is not a trap. I have Left and Right.\nIf I go UP, I am at the edge. Edges can be dangerous if the board fills up, but it's turn 0.\nI have plenty of space.\nTaking the point now is a strong advantage.\nAlso, (4,9) is \"top left\" relative to the center? (4,9) is top-middle.\nEnemy is bottom-middle-ish (2,4).\nWe are far apart.\n\nWhat about the apple at (4,9) being contested?\nNo, enemy is too far.\n\nLet's verify the board state one more time.\n` 9 . . A . A . . . . .`\nIndices 0 to 9.\n0: ., 1: ., 2: A, 3: ., 4: A, 5: ., 6: ., 7: ., 8: ., 9: .\nSo (4,9) is A. (5,9) is . (Empty).\n(3,9) is . (Empty).\n\nWhat if I move RIGHT to (5,8)?\n(5,8) is empty.\n(5,9) is empty.\n(6,8) is empty.\n(5,7) is empty.\nFrom (5,8), I can go UP to (5,9) (empty).\nFrom (5,9), I can go LEFT to (4,9) (Apple).\nPath: (4,8) -> (5,8) -> (5,9) -> (4,9).\nEat at Turn 2.\nThis is slower than going UP directly.\nUP directly is better.\n\nWhat if I move LEFT to (3,8)?\n(3,8) is empty.\n(3,9) is empty.\n(2,8) is empty.\n(3,7) is empty.\nFrom (3,8), UP to (3,9) (empty).\nFrom (3,9), LEFT to (2,9) (Apple).\nPath: (4,8) -> (3,8) -> (3,9) -> (2,9).\nEat at Turn 2.\nAlso slower than UP directly.\n\nSo UP is the only move that gets me an apple *this* turn.\n\nIs there any reason not to take the apple?\nOnly if it traps me.\nI checked, I can go Left or Right from (4,9).\nSo I am not trapped.\nI am safe.\n\nOne final check on the enemy.\nEnemy at (2,4).\nMy planned path: (4,9), (3,9), (2,9).\nEnemy distance to (2,9) is dy=5.\nMy distance to (2,9) is dx=2 (via (3,9)).\nI will arrive at (2,9) before the enemy.\nEven if the enemy goes UP immediately, it takes 5 turns. I take 2 turns.\nSo (2,9) is safe.\n\nTherefore, UP is the optimal move.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nEat the apple at (4,9). Move Left to (3,9) next turn to prepare for the apple at (2,9). Avoid the enemy. Grow as fast as possible while maintaining escape routes.\n\n**Move:**\nUP\n\nUP",

A . . . . . . .`\nIndices 0-9:\n0: ., 1: ., 2: A, 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: ., 8: ., 9: .\nWait, let's re-parse the grid carefully.\n` 9 . . A . . . . . . .`\nLet's map the characters to coordinates:\n0: '.'\n1: '.'\n2: 'A'\n3: '.'\n4: '.'  (This is my X coordinate 4)\n5: '.'\n6: '.'\n7: '.'\n8: '.'\n9: '.'\n\nHold on, the text list \"Apples at\" listed (4,9). But the visual grid shows a dot at index 4 of row 9.\nThis is a discrepancy. I must trust the visual grid representation as the definitive board state for collision and content. The text list might be a summary of *all* apples available on the board, but the grid shows where they actually are *right now*.\nIf (4,9) is empty ('.'), then there is no apple there.\nHowever, the text list \"Apples at\" is exhaustive. If the grid is ambiguous, I should look at the \"Apples at\" list to see what is generally available.\nLet's look at the \"Apples at\" list again:\n(5, 4), (7, 8), (9, 0), (6, 3), (2, 7), (2, 9), (7, 5), (0, 4), (8, 6), (1, 3), (7, 0), (9, 4), (6, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2)\nDoes (4,9) appear in this list? No.\nSo the initial hypothesis that (4,9) was an apple was incorrect (based on the grid).\nWait, looking back at the provided text:\n` 9 . . A . . . . . . .`\nIndex 4 is `.`.\nSo (4,9) is empty.\nMy previous rationale (which was cut off) seemed to conclude UP was good because of an apple at (4,9).\nSince there is NO apple at (4,9), I should re-evaluate.\nWhy did I think there was an apple? The \"Apples at\" list is the ground truth of what's on the board.\nLet's check the \"Apples at\" list for any apple at (4,9).\n(5, 4), (7, 8), (9, 0), (6, 3), (2, 7), (2, 9), (7, 5), (0, 4), (8, 6), (1, 3), (7, 0), (9, 4), (6, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2)\nNo (4,9).\nSo moving UP to (4,9) yields an empty cell.\n\n**Re-evaluating Moves from (4,8):**\nMy current location: (4,8).\nOptions:\n1.  **UP to (4,9):**\n    -   Coordinates: Valid.\n    -   Content: Empty (based on grid).\n    -   Safety: Safe.\n    -   Outcome: Move to edge, no apple.\n    -   Next turn options: Left (3,9), Right (5,9). Down is blocked by my tail (4,8).\n    -   Flexibility: Low (2 options).\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4,7):**\n    -   Coordinates: Valid.\n    -   Content: Empty (Row 7: `7 . . A . . . . . . .`, index 4 is '.').\n    -   Safety: Safe.\n    -   Outcome: Move deeper into the board.\n    -   Next turn options: Up (4,8), Down (4,6), Left (3,7), Right (5,7).\n    -   Flexibility: High (4 options).\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3,8):**\n    -   Coordinates: Valid.\n    -   Content: Empty (Row 8: `8 . . . . 0 . . A . .`, index 3 is '.'). Note: index 4 is '0' (my head).\n    -   Safety: Safe.\n    -   Outcome: Move left.\n    -   Next turn options: Left (2,8), Right (4,8), Up (3,9), Down (3,7).\n    -   Flexibility: High (4 options).\n    -   Apples: (2,9) is nearby (2 steps away). (2,7) is also nearby.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5,8):**\n    -   Coordinates: Valid.\n    -   Content: Empty (Row 8 index 5 is '.').\n    -   Safety: Safe.\n    -   Outcome: Move right.\n    -   Next turn options: Left (4,8), Right (6,8), Up (5,9), Down (5,7).\n    -   Flexibility: High (4 options).\n\n**Strategic Comparison:**\nSince there is NO apple at (4,9), moving UP to the edge is strictly worse than staying in the interior or moving to the interior, as it reduces my immediate future options (only 2 moves next turn vs 4).\nI should prioritize moves that keep my options open.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy is at (1,4).\nMy potential paths:\n-   **LEFT path (towards (2,9), (2,7), etc):**\n    -   (4,8) -> (3,8) -> (2,8) ...\n    -   Apples in this region: (2,9), (2,7), (2,1), (1,3), (3,2).\n    -   Enemy is at (1,4). It might move towards (2,7) or (1,3) or (2,1).\n    -   If I go LEFT, I am engaging in the left side of the board. I should be careful of the enemy.\n    -   Distance to (1,4): dx=3, dy=4.\n-   **RIGHT path:**\n    -   Apples in this region: (5,4), (6,3), (7,0), (7,5), (7,8), (8,6), (9,0), (9,4).\n    -   This seems like a dense cluster of apples (the top-right and bottom-right quadrants).\n    -   Enemy is far away from these (distance ~5-8).\n    -   This seems safer from immediate collision with the enemy.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP is bad because it reduces space (edge) and there is no apple.\nDOWN is safe but I am currently at y=8 (top). Going DOWN moves me away from the high-density apple cluster at the top (specifically (2,9), (7,8), (8,6)).\nWait, looking at the grid:\nRow 8: `8 . . . . 0 . . A . .` -> Apple at (7,8).\nRow 9: `9 . . A . . . . . . .` -> Apple at (2,9).\nThe top row (Row 9) has an apple at (2,9).\nRow 8 has an apple at (7,8).\nSo the top of the board has apples.\nMoving DOWN to (4,7) moves me away from these.\nMoving LEFT to (3,8) keeps me on row 8 (top) and moves towards (2,9).\nMoving RIGHT to (5,8) keeps me on row 8 and moves towards (7,8).\n\nComparing LEFT and RIGHT:\n-   LEFT target (2,9): Distance 2 moves. (3,8) -> (2,8) -> (2,9).\n-   RIGHT target (7,8): Distance 2 moves. (5,8) -> (6,8) -> (7,8).\n\nBoth are similar distances.\nHowever, the enemy is on the left side (x=1).\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving towards the enemy.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving away from the enemy.\nAlso, the RIGHT side has more apples clustered together (7,8, 8,6, 9,4, 9,0).\nTherefore, RIGHT is the safer and more profitable direction.\n\nI will move RIGHT to (5,8).\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (5,8). Next turn, move RIGHT to (6,8) to eat the apple at (7,8). Keep an eye on the enemy at (1,4) and avoid engaging until I have grown significantly.\n\n**Move:**\nRIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Keeps good access to nearby apples at (2,1) and (3,2) and stays away from the board edge.\n- LEFT -> (0,4): contains an apple (0,4). Eating it is also attractive (very close), but placing my head on x=0 puts me on the board edge, slightly reducing immediate maneuvering room.\n- RIGHT -> (2,4): safe but no immediate apple; it moves me away from the nearest apple cluster.\n\nEnemy (snake #0) is at (4,9) with a body segment at (4,8), far away (no immediate head-on threat). No move would run into any occupied cell this turn.\n\nChoice reasoning:\n- Prefer a safe immediate apple that keeps maneuvering options open. DOWN to (1,3) gets an apple now while keeping me off the left edge and leaving multiple escape routes for subsequent turns toward the nearby apples (2,1), (3,2), and the cluster near y=0. That reduces the chance of getting boxed in and allows flexible pursuit of other apples while the enemy focuses up-top.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Eat (1,3) now (DOWN). After growing, prioritize (2,1) and (3,2) while maintaining space and avoiding being cornered against the board edge. Stay aware of the enemy moving down from the top; avoid head-on paths and keep multiple exits open.\n\nDOWN",

A . T 0 . . . .`\nLet's map this to coordinates (x=0 to 9):\n0: '.'\n1: '.'\n2: 'A'\n3: '.'\n4: 'T' (Tail)\n5: '0' (Head)\n6: '.'\n7: '.'\n8: '.'\n9: '.'\nThis matches my stated position: Head (5, 9) and Body (4, 9).\nWait, the problem description lists my Head as (5, 9) and Body as [(4, 9)].\nHowever, the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" section indicates I moved RIGHT in the previous turn.\nIf I moved RIGHT, my head moved from (4, 9) to (5, 9).\nMy body (tail) was at (4, 8) previously.\nAfter moving, my body should be the previous head position (4, 9).\nThe current state says Body is [(4, 9)]. This implies my previous body was [(4, 8)].\nLet's check the board state provided in the prompt for the previous turn (implied by the text \"START LAST RATIONALE\").\nThe rationale snippet says: `My position: Head (4,9), Body [(4,8)]`.\nThis matches a state where the head was at (4,9).\nIf I moved RIGHT from (4,9), I would be at (5,9).\nMy new tail would be the old head (4,9).\nSo the current state is consistent: Head (5,9), Body (4,9).\n\n**Current Threat Assessment:**\nI am at (5, 9). I am on the top row (y=9).\nMoving UP is impossible (off board).\nMy body is at (4, 9).\nThe enemy is at (1, 3). It has a body part at (1, 4).\nThe distance is significant (dx=4, dy=6). Direct collision is unlikely this turn unless the enemy moves aggressively towards the top right.\n\n**Move Options from (5, 9):**\n1.  **UP:** Impossible. (Off board). Eliminated.\n2.  **DOWN:** Target (5, 8).\n    *   **Check Board:** Row 8 shows `8 . . . . . . . A . .`.\n    *   (5, 8) is '.' (Empty).\n    *   **Check Snakes:** My body is at (4, 9). Enemy body is at (1, 3) and (1, 4). No collision.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Future:** Moves to (5, 8) places me in the interior, keeping options open (can go Up, Down, Left, Right).\n3.  **LEFT:** Target (4, 9).\n    *   **Check Board:** (4, 9) is 'T' (My own tail).\n    *   **Rule:** Moving into your own body kills you. (Even though the tail will move away, the rule states \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die\". *Clarification*: In Snake, moving into the space your tail *currently* occupies is safe *if* your tail moves away this turn. However, standard game logic often simplifies this to \"body collision\".\n    *   *Wait*, let's re-read the rules carefully: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n    *   In many Snake variants, moving into the tail's current cell is safe because the tail moves out of it simultaneously. However, the prompt says \"Think very hard... IMPORTANT: Do not perform web searches\".\n    *   Let's look at the provided rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n    *   This is a strict interpretation. If I move LEFT into (4, 9), I am moving into my body segment.\n    *   However, if the tail moves away, it's usually allowed. But given the strictness, let's consider the risk.\n    *   Let's look at the board state.\n    *   Current Head: (5,9). Body: (4,9).\n    *   If I move LEFT, I go to (4,9).\n    *   The tail is currently at (4,9).\n    *   Does the tail move? Yes, every turn the tail moves (unless an apple is eaten).\n    *   If I do not eat an apple, the tail moves from (4,9) to ... where?\n    *   The body is just [(4,9)]. So the \"segment\" behind the tail doesn't exist. The tail is the end.\n    *   If I move into (4,9), the head moves there. The tail moves to \"nowhere\" (it effectively vanishes from that spot).\n    *   In standard Snake, this is a valid move (chasing your tail).\n    *   However, if the rules are implemented strictly (Head hits Body -> Death), then this is a suicide move.\n    *   Given the prompt's emphasis on \"survival\" and \"never choose a move that obviously kills you\", I should avoid ambiguity if possible.\n    *   *Correction*: Let's look at the visual board.\n    *   Row 9: `9 . . A . T 0 . . . .`\n    *   Index 4 is 'T' (Tail).\n    *   Index 5 is '0' (Head).\n    *   If I move LEFT, I target Index 4.\n    *   Is there any apple? No.\n    *   If I eat an apple, I grow, and moving into my tail is safe. If I don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward.\n    *   Actually, let's look at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" snippet provided in the prompt.\n    *   It mentions `My position: Head (4,9), Body [(4,8)]`.\n    *   This implies a previous state. If the current state is Head (5,9), Body (4,9), then moving LEFT is moving into the tail.\n    *   Let's look for apples.\n    *   (4, 9) has no apple.\n    *   So I would *not* be growing.\n    *   If I don't grow, the tail moves forward.\n    *   The tail is currently at (4,9). It moves to ... wait, the body is just [(4,9)].\n    *   Usually, the body list represents the segments.\n    *   If I move LEFT, the new head is (4,9). The new body is [(5,9)] (the old head).\n    *   The old tail (4,9) is now the head.\n    *   This is a valid maneuver in standard snake. You can turn around and chase your tail.\n    *   However, if the game enforces \"Head hits Body\", this fails.\n    *   Let's prioritize safer moves to be sure.\n    *   Is there an apple at (4,9)? No.\n    *   So LEFT is risky and offers no immediate reward.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Target (6, 9).\n    *   **Check Board:** Row 9 shows `9 . . A . T 0 . . . .`\n    *   Index 6 is '.' (Empty).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (Off board at x=10 is invalid, x=6 is valid).\n    *   **Future:** Moves to the corner (6,9). Next turn I can only move DOWN or LEFT (RIGHT goes off board, UP goes off board). This traps me in the corner (2 options). This is risky.\n\n**Comparison of Moves:**\n\n*   **DOWN (5, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Empty cell. No snake bodies there.\n    *   **Reward:** No apple immediately (Grid check: Row 8 index 5 is '.').\n    *   **Positioning:** Moves to the center of the top row.\n    *   **Future Options:** Can go Left (4,8), Right (6,8), Down (5,7), Up (5,9). 4 options. Excellent flexibility.\n    *   **Apple Proximity:**\n        *   (5, 8) is near (7, 8) [Apple] and (2, 9) [Apple].\n        *   (5, 8) is a good hub.\n\n*   **LEFT (4, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Risky (moves into own tail). No apple there.\n    *   **Reward:** None.\n    *   **Positioning:** Stays on edge.\n    *   **Future Options:** Can go Down (4,8) or Right (5,9). (Left is off board, Up is off board). 2 options. Trapped.\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** (4,8) is empty. (3,9) is off board.\n\n*   **RIGHT (6, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe (empty).\n    *   **Reward:** None.\n    *   **Positioning:** Corner (6,9).\n    *   **Future Options:** Can go Down (6,8) or Left (5,9). (Right off board, Up off board). 2 options. Trapped.\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** (6,8) is empty. (7,8) is an apple (2 steps away).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT traps me on the edge with only 2 moves next turn.\nMoving DOWN moves me to (5, 8).\n(5, 8) is an interior cell (relative to the top row).\nFrom (5, 8), I have 4 directions (Up, Down, Left, Right).\nThis maximizes my freedom of movement.\nIt keeps me close to the apples at (7, 8) and (2, 9).\nIt avoids the potential collision of moving into my own tail at (4, 9).\nIt avoids the corner trap at (6, 9).\n\nTherefore, **DOWN** is the optimal move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 8) to open up movement options. From there, I can decide whether to pursue the apple at (7, 8) (Right) or the apple at (2, 9) (Left). I need to keep an eye on the enemy snake at (1, 3), but for now, I am safe. I will prioritize maintaining high mobility to outmaneuver the enemy later.\n\nDOWN",

This is currently occupied by my own body (tail). While in standard snake mechanics this might be survivable if the tail moves away, the rules state \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" To avoid suicide, I will treat this as a lethal move.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target (6, 9). This is an empty cell ('.'). Valid.\n    *   **DOWN:** Target (5, 8). This is an empty cell ('.'). Valid.\n\n2.  **Comparing Valid Moves (RIGHT vs. DOWN):**\n    *   **Move RIGHT (6, 9):**\n        *   **Safety:** Safe.\n        *   **Future Mobility:** From (6, 9), I would be trapped in the corner. I could only move DOWN (6, 8) or LEFT (5, 9). UP and RIGHT would be off the board. This limits my options significantly next turn.\n    *   **Move DOWN (5, 8):**\n        *   **Safety:** Safe.\n        *   **Future Mobility:** From (5, 8), I am on the interior of the top row. I can move UP (5, 9), DOWN (5, 7), LEFT (4, 8), or RIGHT (6, 8). This gives me 4 open directions, maximizing flexibility and escape routes.\n        *   **Apple Proximity:** (5, 8) is a central hub on the top half of the board. From here, I can easily pivot towards apples at (7, 8), (2, 9), or descend toward (7, 5) and others.\n\n3.  **Enemy Assessment:**\n    *   Enemy Snake #1 is at (1, 2) with body (1, 3). This is far away (Manhattan distance > 10).\n    *   There is no immediate threat of collision in the next turn.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** into the corner is suboptimal because it reduces maneuverability and makes me vulnerable to getting trapped.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (5, 8) maintains high flexibility, keeps me safe, and positions me centrally to pursue various apples in the upper half of the board.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nMove to (5, 8) to open up movement options. From there, I will assess whether to pursue the apple cluster at (7, 8) or (2, 9), or descend toward the center apples, depending on the enemy's movement.

While eating a tail isn't strictly possible in standard snake mechanics (the tail moves first), the board visualization shows an 'A' there.

(5, 6) is central. (5, 8) is close to the top wall (y=9).\n\n6.  **Safety Check:**\n    *   **DOWN (5, 6):** Empty. My tail is at (5, 8), moving away. No enemy threat nearby.

The enemy snake is currently in the bottom-left, far from immediate interference. The apple at (5, 6) is the most accessible. After eating it, position yourself to move toward (6, 5) or (7, 5). Avoid getting boxed in near the walls, especially the top wall (y=9). Monitor the enemy's movement, but prioritize your own growth and survival.\n\n**Turn 5 Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Current State:**\n    *   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (5, 6), Body at [(5, 7)]. I just moved **DOWN** to (5, 6).\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Head at (3, 2), Body at [(2, 2), (1, 2)].\n    *   **Apples:** The apple at (5, 6) was listed in the turn description. Since I am currently at (5, 6), I assume I have just consumed it. My score is now 2, and my length is 3. My tail will remain at (5, 7) for this turn (unless I eat again, which is impossible this turn as I just moved).\n\n2.  **Safety Check (Elimination):**\n    *   **Board Bounds:** x in [0,9], y in [0,9].\n    *   **My Body:**\n        *   Head (5, 6).\n        *   Body segment: (5, 7).\n    *   **Enemy Body:** (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2).\n    *   **Possible Moves from (5, 6):**\n        *   **UP to (5, 7):** This is my current body segment (the segment immediately behind the head). Moving here counts as hitting myself. **DEADLY.**\n        *   **DOWN to (5, 5):** Valid coordinate. Cell (5, 5) is empty ('.' on board). Safe.\n        *   **LEFT to (4, 6):** Valid coordinate. Cell (4, 6) is empty ('.' on board). Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Valid coordinate. Cell (6, 6) is empty ('.' on board). Safe.\n\n3.  **Opportunity and Strategy:**\n    *   I am currently at (5, 6) (assuming I ate the apple there).\n    *   **Target Apple Identification:**\n        *   **(6, 5):** Distance 2 (e.g., DOWN then LEFT). Accessible via DOWN or LEFT from current position.\n        *   **(7, 5):** Distance 3.\n        *   **(6, 3):** Distance 3.\n        *   **(7, 0):** Distance 6.\n    *   **Move Evaluation:**\n        *   **UP:** Blocked by self. **Discard.**\n        *   **DOWN (to 5, 5):** Moves me closer to the bottom wall (y=0). While (5, 5) is empty, getting stuck in the bottom rows limits my vertical maneuvering room in future turns. It does not directly align with the nearest apples (6,5 or 7,5).\n        *   **LEFT (to 4, 6):** Moves me away from the dense cluster of apples to the right (center/right side of board). This reduces my future options.\n        *   **RIGHT (to 6, 6):** This is the optimal move. It moves me laterally toward the apples at (6, 5), (7, 5), and (6, 3). It keeps me centrally located (x=6, y=6), maintaining maximum flexibility for the next turn. From (6, 6), I can move DOWN to (6, 5) (which has an apple), LEFT to (5, 6) (my previous position, now safe as the tail will have moved), or continue RIGHT.\n\n4.  **Collision Prediction (Enemy):**\n    *   Enemy head is at (3, 2). It is far away (Manhattan distance ~6).\n    *   I am at (5, 6). There is no immediate threat of head-on collision.\n    *   I will proceed with my optimal path.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **RIGHT** to (6, 6). This avoids immediate death, opens up the path to the apple at (6, 5), and keeps me centrally positioned for future turns.\n\nRIGHT",

This leaves 3 safe options for the next turn.\n*   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy snake is at (4, 3). The Manhattan distance to (7, 5) is |4-7| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5. This is a safe distance.\n    *   *Critical Self-Correction/Planning:* I need to be careful not to move into a trap in the future. The enemy is at (4, 3) with a length of 4. If I continue right to (8, 5) or (9, 5), I risk getting pinned against the wall or maneuvering into a space the enemy can cut off. However, securing the apple at (7, 5) is the immediate priority to tie the score. After eating, I should consider moving Down towards (7, 4) or (7, 3) to open up the board and get closer to the apple at (6, 3) and (7, 0), rather than getting trapped at the right edge.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving RIGHT is the optimal move. It gains a point, maintains safety for this turn, and opens up vertical movement options for subsequent turns to avoid getting trapped against the right wall.\n\n**Plan:** Eat the apple at (7, 5). Then, plan to move DOWN to (7, 4) next turn to prepare for the lower apples and avoid the right wall trap.\n\nRIGHT",

After eating at (6,3) re-evaluate: if the enemy pushes toward the top, pivot back to the (5,4)/(5,5) apples or head left toward the less-contested apple cluster.

The Manhattan distance is |7-5| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n    *   **Wall Trapping:** I am at x=7. Moving RIGHT to x=8 leaves x=9 as the only further right option before the wall. This limits future maneuverability.\n    *   **Opening the Board:** Moving UP or DOWN keeps x=7, which is center-right. This allows movement in 3 directions next turn (Left, Right, and the remaining vertical).\n\n    *   **Evaluating Moves:**\n        *   **RIGHT (to 8, 5):** Moves me closer to the right wall. Opens up (9,5). Moves me closer to apple at (9,4). However, if I get trapped at (9,5) or (9,4), I might have trouble escaping if the enemy approaches. This is a \"cornering\" risk.\n        *   **UP (to 7, 6):** Moves me towards apple at (8, 6). Keeps me away from the immediate danger of the enemy (currently at y=3). (7, 6) allows LEFT (6,6), DOWN (7,5 - my previous spot/tail depending on growth), RIGHT (8,6 - apple). This is a very open move.\n        *   **DOWN (to 7, 4):** Moves me towards apples at (7,0) and (6,3). Puts me slightly closer to the enemy at (5,3). (7, 4) allows UP (7,5), LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4). Also open.\n\n    *   **Comparing UP vs DOWN:**\n        *   The enemy is at (5,3). If I go DOWN to (7,4), the distance is 2.\n        *   If I go UP to (7,6), the distance is 4.\n        *   Generally, keeping distance from the enemy is safer unless there is a significant apple advantage in the dangerous direction.\n        *   The apple at (8, 6) is very attractive. It's adjacent to (7, 6).\n        *   The apple at (7, 0) is far down.\n\n    *   **Decision:** I will move **UP** to (7, 6).\n        *   Reason 1: It moves me toward the apple at (8, 6).\n        *   Reason 2: It increases distance from the enemy snake (currently at y=3).\n        *   Reason 3: It avoids the wall trap on the right side.\n        *   Reason 4: It keeps my options open (Left, Down, Right) for the next turn.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (7, 6) to get closer to the apple at (8, 6) and maintain distance from the enemy. From (7, 6), I will be positioned to either eat (8, 6) or maneuver around it if blocked, while keeping the rest of the board open. I will continue to monitor the enemy's movement relative to my path.\n\nUP",

(7, 7) is empty.\n        *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 5):**\n        *   Check board: (7, 5) is my body segment.\n        *   **Result:** **DEADLY** (Collision with own body).\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 6):**\n        *   Check board: (6, 6) is my body segment.\n        *   **Result:** **DEADLY** (Collision with own body).\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 6):**\n        *   Check board: (8, 6) contains an Apple 'A'.\n        *   Check enemy body: Safe.\n        *   Check my body: Safe.\n        *   **Result:** Safe (and eating).\n\n3.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    *   **Constraints:** I am in a slightly tricky spot. My body fills (7, 5), (6, 5), and (6, 6). This blocks LEFT (into 6, 6) and DOWN (into 7, 5). I am effectively forced to go either UP or RIGHT.\n    *   **Evaluating UP (to 7, 7):**\n        *   Moves me away from the enemy (currently at y=3).\n        *   Opens up the path to (7, 8) and (7, 9) apples.\n        *   However, looking at the board, (7, 7) is empty. From (7, 7), I could potentially go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Wait, if I go UP to (7, 7), my body will shift: Head (7, 7), Body (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5). This leaves (6, 6) open.\n    *   **Evaluating RIGHT (to 8, 6):**\n        *   This contains an apple at (8, 6).\n        *   Eating extends my tail immediately. If I eat, the tail (6, 6) stays for this turn (the snake grows). My body becomes [(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)].\n        *   **Pros:** Gain +1 score. Secures a point. Keeps me moving right away from the wall on the left side (though I'm already on the right side).\n        *   **Cons:** I am currently at x=7. Moving to x=8 puts me at x=8. From x=8, I can go to x=9 (wall limit). This is slightly more restrictive than being at x=7. However, the apple is worth it.\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:** Enemy is at (6, 3). They are very far vertically (distance of 3) and horizontally (distance of 1). They are not an immediate threat to my current head position (7, 6) unless they make a significant vertical move towards me. Given the current board state, they are likely moving for apples at (6, 0), (5, 4), or (7, 0).\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Option A (UP): Moves to (7, 7). No apple. Sets up (7, 8) or (8, 7).\n        *   Option B (RIGHT): Moves to (8, 6). Eats apple. Sets up (9, 6) or (8, 7) or (8, 5).\n    *   **Decision:** The apple at (8, 6) is directly adjacent. It is safer to take a guaranteed apple now than to defer it, especially since my movement options are already limited by my own body. Taking the apple extends my length, which helps in future survival and score accumulation. The move to (8, 6) is safe.\n\n4.  **Plan:**\n    Move **RIGHT** to eat the apple at (8, 6). This secures a point and extends the snake. From (8, 6), I will assess the open spaces (likely UP to (8, 7) or LEFT to (7, 6), avoiding my own tail which will have shifted).\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Its neck is (7,5), and its body includes (6,5) and (6,6). From (7,6) the enemy cannot move into its neck (7,5) this turn and cannot move into its own body squares. Its realistic moves are (7,7) or (8,6) (the latter has an apple). None of the enemy's one-move options reach any of my candidate squares (6,4), (6,2), or (7,3), so there is no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n- (6,4) is just below the enemy\u2019s body at y=5, but it is currently empty and not reachable by the enemy next turn, so moving there is safe now.\n\nTactical evaluation:\n- UP to (6,4) positions me to take (5,4) next turn (an apple) by moving left, or to swing right/up if needed. It keeps two good follow-up options and moves me toward nearby apples (5,4) and then 5,5, while not stepping directly into the tighter area around the enemy head/body at y=5\u20136.\n- RIGHT to (7,3) is also safe and keeps options open (toward apples on the right/bottom), but it delays capturing the cluster of apples at (5,4)/(5,5) which are nearby and unthreatened.\n- DOWN to (6,2) is the safest-escape move but gives up immediate apple access and moves away from the denser apple cluster.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move UP to (6,4) this turn to set up grabbing (5,4) on the following turn. After taking (5,4) consider grabbing (5,5) next or sidestepping toward less-contested apples if the enemy pushes down. Always keep at least two escape directions and avoid stepping into the enemy\u2019s body or into tight spaces where the enemy can cut me off.\n\nMove:\nUP",

I moved RIGHT from (7, 6) to eat an apple in the previous turn.\n    *   **Body:** [(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)].\n    *   **Apples:** 5.\n    *   **Constraints:** I am at x=8. My body occupies (7, 6) (immediately behind), (7, 5), (6, 5), and (6, 6). My tail is at (6, 6). I cannot move LEFT into (7, 6) as that is my own body.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (6, 4).\n    *   **Body:** [(6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)].\n    *   **Apples:** 4.\n    *   **Observation:** The enemy moved RIGHT from (6, 3) to (6, 4). Note that (6, 4) is the location of an apple in the list: `(6, 4)` (likely the apple originally at `(5, 4)` was eaten by me in the previous turn? Or perhaps the apple list didn't update in the visualizer for the turn I just moved. Wait, the prompt says \"Turn: 10 / 150\" and lists the apples. The previous move was \"RIGHT\" from (7, 6) to (8, 6). (8, 6) was an apple. So I ate (8, 6). The enemy is at (6, 4). Let's verify the apple list: `(5, 4), (7, 8)...` Yes, (5, 4) was an apple. The enemy at (6, 4) is not eating an apple on this turn (it moved into that empty space or ate (5, 4) if we assume movement includes consumption).\n    *   **Threat Analysis:** The enemy is at (6, 4). I am at (8, 6). The Manhattan distance is $|8-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4$. This is a safe distance for now.\n\n**Safety Check (Elimination):**\nMy head is at (8, 6).\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   Check board: (8, 7) is empty ('.').\n    *   Check enemy body: Enemy is at y=4 and x=6. (8, 7) is far away.\n    *   Check my body: My body is at (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6). (8, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):**\n    *   Check board: (8, 5) is empty ('.').\n    *   Check enemy body: Safe.\n    *   Check my body: My body is at (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6). (8, 5) is empty.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):**\n    *   Check board: (7, 6) is my body segment.\n    *   **Result:** **DEADLY** (Collision with own body).\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):**\n    *   Check board: (9, 6) is empty ('.').\n    *   Check enemy body: Safe.\n    *   Check my body: Safe.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Constraints:** I am at x=8, y=6. I cannot move LEFT. My only valid moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n*   **Evaluating RIGHT (to 9, 6):**\n    *   Moves me to the right wall (x=9).\n    *   From (9, 6), my only valid moves next turn would be UP, DOWN, or LEFT (into my own body if it stays there, but usually the tail moves).\n    *   Being on the wall limits mobility slightly.\n*   **Evaluating UP (to 8, 7):**\n    *   Moves me into open space.\n    *   From (8, 7), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or potentially RIGHT (if I don't go to 9,6 yet).\n    *   The apple at (7, 8) is at distance 2 from (8, 7).\n    *   The apple at (8, 2) is far away.\n*   **Evaluating DOWN (to 8, 5):**\n    *   Moves me into open space.\n    *   The apple at (8, 2) is at distance 3 from (8, 5).\n    *   The enemy is at (6, 4). Moving down to (8, 5) increases distance from the enemy.\n    *   However, the apple at (8, 2) requires passing through (8, 4) and (8, 3). (7, 0) is also an apple.\n    *   Let's look at the board again.\n        *   Row 5: `. . . . . A T T . .` -> (8, 5) is empty.\n        *   Row 6: `. . . . . . T T 0 .` -> My tail is at (6, 6).\n        *   Row 4: `A A . . . A 1 . . A` -> Enemy at (6, 4).\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Moving UP to (8, 7) keeps me near the top wall but opens up (7, 8) and (7, 9) apples.\n        *   Moving DOWN to (8, 5) moves me towards the center and the (8, 2) apple. It also keeps me away from the wall, maintaining more open space (since I can't go RIGHT past 9, but I can go LEFT later).\n        *   Moving RIGHT to (9, 6) puts me in a corner-like position (x=9 wall). It's generally better to avoid walls if possible to keep options open.\n    *   **Decision:** Between UP and DOWN, DOWN seems slightly more interesting as it moves towards more apples (8, 2, 7, 0) and away from the wall. However, UP is also very safe. Let's look at the immediate threat. The enemy is at (6, 4). If I go UP to (8, 7), I am moving away. If I go DOWN to (8, 5), I am moving closer to the enemy's vertical range (y=3,4) but keeping x-distance.\n    *   Let's reconsider UP. (8, 7) -> (7, 8) -> (7, 9). This is a clean path to 2 apples.\n    *   Let's reconsider DOWN. (8, 5) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 2). Is (8, 4) safe? Row 4: `A A . . . A 1 . . A`. (8, 4) is empty. (8, 3) is empty. (8, 2) has an apple.\n    *   The enemy at (6, 4) is a threat to (8, 5) only if they move 2 steps right, which is impossible in one turn. The enemy at (6, 4) is a threat to (8, 4) only if they move 2 steps right. This is safe.\n    *   Let's look at the board again. `(7, 8)` is an apple. `(7, 9)` is an apple. `(8, 2)` is an apple.\n    *   If I go UP, I am getting closer to the top wall. If I go DOWN, I am getting closer to the bottom wall but with more vertical space.\n    *   Actually, `(7, 8)` and `(7, 9)` are clustered. `(8, 2)` and `(7, 0)` are separate.\n    *   Let's look at my previous turn's rationale. It planned to go UP or RIGHT. I went RIGHT and ate (8, 6).\n    *   Now at (8, 6).\n    *   If I go UP to (8, 7):\n        *   Next turn I can go LEFT to (7, 7) or UP to (8, 8).\n        *   If I go LEFT to (7, 7), I can go UP to (7, 8) to eat the apple.\n        *   This seems like a solid plan.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (8, 5):\n        *   I am heading towards the open space in the center.\n        *   Enemy is at (6, 4). My tail is at (6, 6).\n        *   If I go DOWN, I open up LEFT to (7, 5) (which is my body), UP to (8, 6) (old head pos), DOWN to (8, 4), RIGHT to (9, 5).\n        *   The path to (8, 2) is clear vertically.\n    *   **Comparison of UP vs DOWN:**\n        *   UP moves to (8, 7).\n        *   DOWN moves to (8, 5).\n        *   (8, 5) is closer to the center of the board and generally more flexible than (8, 7) which is near the top wall. However, (8, 7) offers a direct path to two apples: (7, 8) and (7, 9).\n        *   (8, 5) offers a path to (8, 2) and (7, 0).\n        *   The enemy is at (6, 4). The distance from (8, 5) to (6, 4) is 3. The distance from (8, 7) to (6, 4) is 5.\n        *   Moving UP is safer from the enemy.\n        *   Moving DOWN puts me in the same vertical band as the enemy, which could lead to future conflict if we both want apples in that area (e.g., (7, 0)).\n        *   Given the enemy is at (6, 4), moving UP to (8, 7) creates maximum distance and heads towards the top-right cluster of apples.\n        *   Also, moving UP avoids the potential traffic jam near the center where the enemy might be roaming.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (8, 7). This keeps me safe, moves me towards the apples at (7, 8) and (7, 9), and maximizes distance from the enemy currently at (6, 4). From (8, 7), I will likely aim to go LEFT to (7, 7) next turn to prepare for eating (7, 8).\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move UP.\n\nUP",

Let's evaluate the four directions.\n*   **UP (8, 9):** Is it on the board? Yes, y=9 is within 0-9. Is it my body? No. Is it enemy body? The enemy body is at [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)]. No collision. Is it an apple? Yes, (8, 9) contains an apple (from the board state 'A A . .' on row 9). Moving here eats an apple and grows. Safe.\n*   **DOWN (8, 7):** Is it my body? Yes, (8, 7) is the second element of my body (immediately behind head). Collision. **DEADLY**.\n*   **LEFT (7, 8):** Is it my body? No. Is it enemy body? No. Is it an apple? Yes, (7, 8) contains an apple. Safe. However, note that my tail is at (7, 5). This is far away, so the body segment (7, 5) will likely not move away from (7, 8) before I get there. Wait, looking at my body: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)]. The segment (7, 6) is at y=6. (7, 8) is at y=8. (7, 6) is not (7, 8). (7, 5) is at y=5. So (7, 8) is empty. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (9, 8):** Is it on the board? Yes. Is it my body? No. Is it enemy body? No. Is it an apple? No, it's empty. Safe.\n\n**2. Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Enemy Prediction:** Enemy head is at (5, 5). Potential moves: UP (5, 6), DOWN (5, 4), LEFT (4, 5), RIGHT (6, 5).\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (5, 6): He hits his own body (5, 4 is in his body, but 5,6? No, his body is (5,4)... wait, his body is [(5, 4), (6, 4)...]. (5, 6) is empty. He might move there.\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 5): (6, 5) is empty on board. He might move there.\n    *   My potential moves:\n        *   UP (8, 9): Distance to enemy (5, 5) is 3+4=7. Safe distance.\n        *   LEFT (7, 8): Distance to enemy (5, 5) is 2+3=5.\n        *   RIGHT (9, 8): Distance to enemy (5, 5) is 4+3=7.\n*   **Apple Availability:**\n    *   UP (8, 9): Immediate apple at (8, 9). Opens up (8, 9) to (9, 9) (apple). (9, 9) is apple. (7, 9) is apple.\n    *   LEFT (7, 8): Immediate apple at (7, 8). Opens up (8, 8) (now empty), (7, 9) (apple), (6, 8) (empty).\n    *   RIGHT (9, 8): No immediate apple. Leads to (9, 9) (apple) next turn, or (8, 8).\n*   **Space & Traps:**\n    *   (8, 9) is on the top wall. Moving here puts me on the wall. While (8, 9) connects to (9, 9) and (7, 9), it limits my vertical movement. However, (7, 8) is also very close to the wall. (7, 8) has (8, 8) behind it (which will be empty after I move if I don't go there) and (6, 8) to the left.\n    *   (7, 8) is a very strong position. It sits directly adjacent to two apples: (7, 9) and (8, 9). It also has (8, 8) behind it, which is a safe retreat path.\n    *   (9, 8) is on the right wall. It has access to (9, 9) and (8, 8).\n*   **Comparison (7, 8) vs (8, 9):**\n    *   (7, 8) is central-top. It has access to 3 apples: (7, 8) [current], (7, 9), (8, 9). It also has access to (6, 8) and (6, 9) which are currently open.\n    *   (8, 9) is corner-top. It has access to 2 apples: (8, 9) [current], (9, 9). It also has access to (7, 9).\n    *   (7, 8) offers more flexibility and more immediate apple cluster access.\n    *   Furthermore, (7, 8) moves me further from the \"center\" where the enemy is likely to be. The enemy is at (5, 5). Moving to (7, 8) (distance 5) vs (8, 9) (distance 7). Both are relatively safe. But (7, 8) is more aggressive in securing the top-left quadrant.\n\n**3. Decision:**\nI will choose **LEFT** to (7, 8).\n*   It is safe (no collision).\n*   It eats an apple immediately (growing my snake).\n*   It positions me in a \"hot zone\" of apples ((7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)).\n*   It provides better maneuverability than the wall-adjacent (8, 9) or (9, 8).\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (7, 8). Next turn, target (7, 9) or (8, 9) depending on enemy movement.\n**END RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

Potential moves: UP (5, 6), DOWN (5, 4), LEFT (4, 5), RIGHT (6, 5).\n    *   The enemy is currently at (4, 5) in the prompt data (I moved to 7,8, enemy is at 4,5). Wait, looking at the provided state: \"Enemy State: Head (4, 5), Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3)]\".\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 5): That is currently the first segment of his body (Head 4,5 -> Body 5,5). He would be hitting himself.\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (4, 6): Empty.\n    *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (4, 4): Empty.\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (3, 5): Empty.\n*   **Apple Availability:**\n    *   UP (7, 9): Immediate apple. Also adjacent to (8, 9) (apple) and (6, 9) (empty).\n    *   LEFT (6, 8): Immediate apple. Also adjacent to (6, 9) (empty), (5, 8) (empty), and (7, 8) (will be empty).\n    *   DOWN (7, 7): No apple immediately. Adjacent to (6, 7) (empty).\n*   **Space & Traps:**\n    *   **UP (7, 9):** Moves me to the very top edge of the board. This restricts my movement to 3 directions (Left, Right, Down) or potentially only 2 if I get trapped against the wall later. While it grabs an apple, it puts me in a corner-like position.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 8):** Moves me to (6, 8). This position is centrally located in the top half. It has access to:\n        *   (6, 9) - Up (Empty)\n        *   (5, 8) - Left (Empty)\n        *   (7, 8) - Right (Will be empty after I leave)\n        *   (6, 7) - Down (Empty)\n    *   (6, 8) offers 4 open paths (assuming the tail moves). This maximizes future flexibility.\n    *   (6, 8) is also one step closer to the center of the board and the enemy's general location (if I need to confront him later), whereas (7, 9) isolates me at the top.\n    *   Also, moving to (6, 8) keeps me away from the enemy at (4, 5). Distance from (6, 8) to (4, 5) is 2+3=5. Distance from (7, 9) to (4, 5) is 3+4=7. Both are safe distances.\n\n**3. Decision:**\nI will choose **LEFT** to (6, 8).\n*   It is safe (no collision).\n*   It eats an apple immediately (growing my snake).\n*   It positions me in a much more flexible location (4 potential escape routes) compared to the top wall at (7, 9).\n*   It keeps me in a central position to react to the enemy's next move.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (6, 8). Next turn, target (6, 9) or (5, 8) depending on enemy movement to maintain maximum board control.\n**END RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

This reduces the buffer zone.\n    *   **Decision:** I want to maintain space. Going UP to (6, 9) puts me against the wall, which is a risk if the enemy cuts me off. Going DOWN towards (6, 7) moves me closer to the enemy's Y-level, increasing collision risk if he moves UP.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 8)** seems like the best balance. It keeps me at Y=8 (top half), moves me away from the immediate center, and sets me up to potentially grab (5, 9) or (4, 9) or (4, 8) next turn. It also avoids moving towards the enemy's current location.\n    *   **Comparison with UP:**\n        *   UP (6, 9): Wall. 3 directions.\n        *   LEFT (5, 8): Open. 4 directions (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n        *   Space is critical for survival and outlasting the enemy.\n\n**3.

My snake's head is now at (5, 8), and my body has lengthened, meaning the cell (6, 8) is now occupied by my body. The enemy snake's position remains unchanged at (3, 6). I must re-evaluate safe moves based on the updated state.\n\n**1. Immediate Safety Check:**\nMy head is at (5, 8). Let's evaluate the four directions.\n*   **UP (5, 9):** Is it on the board? Yes. Is it my body? No (My body occupies (6, 8), (7, 8), etc., but not (5, 9)). Is it enemy body? No. Is it an apple? Yes (Listed in apples: (5, 9) is `A` in the visual board at 9: `. A A . . . . A . .` -> (4,9) is A, (5,9) is A). **Safe.**\n*   **DOWN (5, 7):** Is it on the board? Yes. Is it my body? No (My body is mostly at x >= 6 or y=8). Is it enemy body? No (Enemy is at x=3, y=6). Is it an apple? No. **Safe.**\n*   **LEFT (4, 8):** Is it on the board? Yes. Is it my body? No. Is it enemy body? No. Is it an apple? No. **Safe.**\n*   **RIGHT (6, 8):** Is it on the board? Yes. Is it my body? **Yes**, (6, 8) is the first segment of my body (immediately behind head). Collision. **DEADLY.**\n\n**2. Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Enemy Prediction:** Enemy head is at (3, 6). Potential moves: UP (3, 7), DOWN (3, 5), LEFT (2, 6), RIGHT (4, 6).\n    *   (4, 6) is currently an apple on the board. If the enemy moves there, they will eat and grow.\n    *   (3, 5) is currently empty (occupied by my tail in previous turn, but now empty as I moved).\n    *   (3, 7) is empty.\n    *   (2, 6) is empty.\n*   **Apple Availability:**\n    *   **UP (5, 9):** This move lands directly on an apple at (5, 9). This allows me to grow immediately, extending my length and putting me at 7 apples.\n    *   **LEFT (4, 8):** Moves me to an empty square. Adjacent to (4, 9) which is an apple, but requires another turn to get there.\n    *   **DOWN (5, 7):** Moves me to an empty square. Not immediately rewarding.\n*   **Long-term Strategy (Kiting the Enemy):**\n    *   The enemy is at (3, 6). I am at (5, 8). The vertical distance is 2, horizontal distance is 2.\n    *   If I go UP to (5, 9), I reach the top wall (Y=9). However, (5, 9) is an apple, and (4, 9) is also an apple right next to it. By eating at (5, 9), I prepare to possibly eat at (4, 9) next turn (if safe), utilizing the top row.\n    *   The risk of being at the top row (Y=9) is restricted movement (only Down, Left, Right). However, having an apple at (5, 9) and (4, 9) creates a \"food pocket\" at the top that is worth securing.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (4, 8), I maintain the wall (Y=8 is not a wall, but Y=9 is close). I don't get the immediate food bonus.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (5, 7), I move closer to the enemy's Y-level (Y=6), reducing my safe buffer space.\n    *   **Decision:** Eating the apple at (5, 9) is the most beneficial move. It increases my score (tied or leading against enemy), extends my body (which might block the enemy later), and positions me to grab another apple at (4, 9) next turn. The immediate safety check confirms (5, 9) is not occupied by my body or the enemy.\n\n**3. Decision:**\nI will choose **UP** to (5, 9).\n*   It is safe (no collision).\n*   It eats an apple (+1 score, +1 length).\n*   It positions me to potentially eat (4, 9) next turn, maximizing resource gain in the top corner.\n*   It maintains distance from the enemy at (3, 6).\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to (5, 9) to eat the apple. Next turn, check if (4, 9) is safe to eat the second apple. Monitor enemy movement towards the center apples.\n\nUP",

A A . . 0 . A . .`; (4, 9) is `.`, (3, 9) is `A`). It is not my body (my body is at x >= 5, y <= 8). It is not the enemy body (enemy body is at y <= 6). It is on the board. **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (6, 9) - This cell is currently empty (checked against board state `9 . A A . . 0 . A . .`; (6, 9) is `0`? Wait, looking closely: `9 . A A . . 0 . A . .`. Indices: 0: `.`, 1: `A`, 2: `A`, 3: `.`, 4: `.`, 5: `.`, 6: `0`, 7: `.`, 8: `A`, 9: `.`. My head is at (5, 9). So (6, 9) is index 6, which is `0`. But my head is at (5, 9), which corresponds to index 5. Index 6 is (6, 9). The symbol at index 6 is `0`. This implies (6, 9) is empty (represented by `0` in the text map, but likely just empty space. The `0` in the map corresponds to my head at (5,9)? No, the map key says `0` is my snake. Let's look at the map: `9 . A A . . 0 . A . .`. My head is (5,9). So at index 5, there is a `0`. That is my head. At index 6, there is a `.`. So (6, 9) is `.`. (Wait, the map shows `0` at index 5? Let's re-read: `9 . A A . . 0 . A . .`. The indices are 0-9. Index 5 is the 6th character. The string is \". A A . . 0 . A . .\". The characters are: 0: `.`, 1: `A`, 2: `A`, 3: `.`, 4: `.`, 5: `0`, 6: `.`, 7: `A`, 8: `.`, 9: `.`. Yes, my head (5,9) is the `0`. So (6,9) (index 6) is `.` (empty). (7,9) (index 7) is `A`. (8,9) (index 8) is `.`. (9,9) (index 9) is `.`.\n    *   So (6, 9) is empty. It is not my body (my body is at (5,8), (6,8)...). It is not enemy body. **SAFE.**\n    *   **Summary of Safe Moves:** LEFT to (4, 9) or RIGHT to (6, 9).\n\n3.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    *   **Apple Availability:**\n        *   (4, 9) is empty.\n        *   (6, 9) is empty.\n        *   (7, 9) is an Apple.\n        *   (3, 9) is an Apple.\n    *   **Enemy Interaction:**\n        *   Enemy is at (4, 6). They are far away vertically (difference of 3).\n        *   Enemy likely cannot reach the top row (y=9) in one move.\n    *   **Future Options:**\n        *   If I move **LEFT to (4, 9)**: I can next move to (3, 9) (Apple) or (4, 8) (Empty). However, (4, 8) is adjacent to my body at (5, 8) and (6, 8). (4, 8) is safe currently, but moving there puts me close to my own body. More importantly, (3, 9) is an apple. From (4, 9), I am flanked by apples at (3, 9) and (7, 9) is two steps away.\n        *   If I move **RIGHT to (6, 9)**: I move closer to the apple at (7, 9) and the empty space at (9, 9). From (6, 9), I can immediately go to (7, 9) next turn to eat. (6, 9) is also further from the \"crowded\" left side of the board where my tail is currently anchored (left side of the board is getting cluttered with apples and potential body traps).\n    *   **Trapping Risk:**\n        *   Moving LEFT to (4, 9) puts me against the wall. My next options would be (3, 9), (4, 8), or (5, 9) (backwards - deadly). (4, 8) is safe now, but it is directly adjacent to my body at (5, 8) and (6, 8). If I go to (4, 8), I am in a \"U\" shape formed by the wall (x<4) and my body (x>4). This is risky if my body grows.\n        *   Moving RIGHT to (6, 9) keeps me more open. I have the entire right side of the board (x=7, 8, 9) available. From (6, 9), I can go to (7, 9) (Apple) or (6, 8) (Body - Deadly). Wait, (6, 8) is my body. So from (6, 9), I cannot go DOWN. I can only go LEFT (back to 5,9), RIGHT (7,9), or UP (dead). This is a slight constraint, but (7, 9) is a guaranteed apple next turn.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   LEFT: Moves to (4, 9). Next turn options: (3, 9) [Apple], (4, 8) [Safe but tight]. No immediate apple gain.\n        *   RIGHT: Moves to (6, 9). Next turn options: (7, 9) [Apple], (5, 9) [Back]. Immediate path to an apple.\n\n    *   **Decision:** Moving **RIGHT** is superior. It secures a path to the apple at (7, 9) for the next turn. The board state shows (7, 9) is an apple. Moving to (6, 9) aligns with the apple at (7, 9). Moving to (4, 9) leaves me adjacent to empty space and apples are further left, but the right side is cleaner and offers a direct food source.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n    Move **RIGHT** to (6, 9). This is safe, avoids immediate collision, and positions me to eat the apple at (7, 9) next turn.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy head (5,9) can only move left or right along y=9, so no immediate head-on threat to (4,7) or (5,6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,6) leaves only two follow-up options next turn (UP or RIGHT) because (4,6) would be neck and (5,5) is still body (collision if attempted). That tightens mobility.\n- Moving UP to (4,7) preserves three follow-up options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) and keeps more escape routes open.\n\nApple/strategic considerations:\n- No apple at (4,7) or (5,6). UP positions me to reach the nearby apple cluster at (2,7)/(2,9) via safer routing (UP then LEFT), while keeping distance from the enemy's top-right area.\n- Preserving extra options reduces the chance of getting boxed by my own body or the opponent later.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP now to maintain mobility and approach the (2,7)/(2,9) apples.\n- On subsequent turns favor routes that keep at least two escape moves available and avoid the enemy\u2019s top-right corridor.\n\nUP",

(8, 9) and (9, 9) are empty.\n\n**2. Immediate Move Options (Safety Check):**\n*   **UP:** (6, 10) -> Off board. **DEADLY.**\n*   **DOWN:** (6, 8) -> This cell is part of my own body (segment at index 2). **DEADLY.**\n*   **LEFT:** (5, 9) -> This cell is currently occupied by my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). **DEADLY.**\n*   **RIGHT:** (7, 9) -> This cell contains an Apple. It is not my body (my body is at x <= 8, y <= 9, but specifically (7,9) is empty in the body list). It is not the enemy body (enemy y <= 7). It is on the board. **SAFE.**\n\n**3. Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Constraints:** I am currently \"pinned\" against the wall at the top row (y=9). My only safe move is RIGHT.\n*   **Immediate Goal:** Eating the apple at (7, 9). This move is mandatory for survival and score gain.\n*   **Future Outlook (Next Turn):**\n    *   After moving to (7, 9), my head will be at (7, 9), and my body will extend to include (6, 9).\n    *   From (7, 9), my available moves will be:\n        *   UP: Off board (Deadly).\n        *   DOWN: (7, 8) - Currently empty (checked board state: `(8 . . . . . T T T T .)` shows index 7 is `.`, index 8 is `T` (tail)). **Safe.**\n        *   LEFT: (6, 9) - Will be occupied by my own body (the segment I just left). **Deadly.**\n        *   RIGHT: (8, 9) - Empty. **Safe.**\n    *   This confirms that eating the apple at (7, 9) will not trap me; I will have options (DOWN or RIGHT) for the following turn.\n*   **Enemy Interaction:** The enemy is at (4, 7). They are on the lower half of the board. They are not an immediate threat to the top-right corner where I am currently moving.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nThe only safe move is RIGHT, which also happens to be the optimal move to collect an apple and maintain board control. Moving right ensures survival and increases my score to 7 apples, matching the enemy's score.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (7, 9), I will likely move DOWN to (7, 8) to open up movement options and descend towards the center of the board. I need to avoid the right wall at x=9 and eventually loop back towards the apples at (0, 4) or (1, 4) if the top row becomes dangerous. The enemy is currently passive; I must maintain my lead.\n\nRIGHT",

It is safe this turn and, after the move, I will still have at least two follow-up options (LEFT to the apple or UP to open space).\n- UP (4,8) is safe and keeps slightly more freedom, but is a longer route to the nearest apples in the left cluster.\n- RIGHT (5,7) edges me toward the enemy area and into a tighter neighborhood (enemy body occupies several nearby y=8 cells), which reduces safe future options.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move LEFT now toward the apple cluster at x=2.

This creates a dangerous bottleneck where I could be easily trapped or die if that space is occupied.\n*   **Option B (DOWN - Avoid Apple):** Moving to (7, 8) bypasses the apple at (8, 9).\n    *   *Future:* From (7, 8), I am free to move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn (UP is blocked by my body at (7, 9) eventually, but right now (7, 9) will be empty after I leave).\n    *   *Analysis:* (7, 8) is currently empty. (8, 8) is part of my body, so I cannot move RIGHT from (7, 8). However, I can move DOWN to (7, 7) or LEFT to (6, 8). This keeps my movement options open and avoids the \"corner trap.\"\n    *   *Note on the Apple:* The apple at (8, 9) is currently contested.\n        *   Enemy at (3, 7) is far away.\n        *   My body will block the path from the left.\n        *   The only access points for the apple are from (8, 8) (blocked by my body) and (9, 9) (which is empty).\n        *   If I move DOWN to (7, 8) now, I can loop back to (8, 8) or (8, 9) later if it remains safe, or I can secure the apples at (9, 4) or (9, 0) which are currently more accessible via the right wall.\n*   **Enemy Interaction:** The enemy is still at (3, 7) and hasn't moved aggressively toward me. My priority is survival and maintaining mobility.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to eat the apple is a trap. It leads to a position with only one safe exit (9,9 -> 9,8) or forces a risky move. Moving DOWN to (7, 8) avoids this trap, keeps my future options open, and allows me to descend the board to collect the apples on the right wall (9,4), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0) which are currently safe and lead to a wider area of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nDescend from the top wall to the right side of the board. Secure the apples at (9, 4), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), and (4, 0) which form a path down the right edge. This avoids the central congestion and gives me a safe route to accumulate points while keeping the enemy at a distance.
