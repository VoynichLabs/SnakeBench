Apples everywhere but we ignore them for now? Nah, we gotta grow to dominate! But safety first.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (3,3) - Empty, safe.  \n**DOWN** \u2192 (3,1) - Empty, safe.  \n**LEFT** \u2192 (2,2) - Empty, safe.  \n**RIGHT** \u2192 (4,2) - Empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now. No bodies anywhere.\n\nBut think: enemy is far away at (8,6). Head-on collision impossible this turn. So we can move freely.\n\nLong-term plan: We need to grow and cut off enemy's space. He's in the top-right. We're bottom-left. We should move toward center to control board.\n\nClosest apple? (1,1) is close but down-left from us. (4,1) is down-right. (5,3) is up-right.\n\nI want to move toward center while also being able to chase apples next turn.\n\nIf I go **UP** to (3,3), I'm closer to (5,3) apple and center.  \nIf I go **RIGHT** to (4,2), also closer to center and (4,1) below.\n\nBut going UP gives more future options\u2014can go left/right/up next turn.\n\nActually, let's be aggressive: move toward enemy eventually, but first grow a bit.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \n- Grow to length 2 or 3 quickly by eating nearest apple.  \n- Then start boxing enemy in from the center.  \n- Watch enemy's moves\u2014if he goes for apples top-right, we cut off his escape.\n\nChat, what you think? UP feels good for positioning.\n\nUP",

Apples everywhere but we stay focused on domination!\n\nCheck immediate moves:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (3,4) - Empty, safe.  \n**DOWN** \u2192 (3,2) - Empty, safe.  \n**LEFT** \u2192 (2,3) - Empty, safe.  \n**RIGHT** \u2192 (4,3) - Empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now \u2014 no bodies anywhere yet.\n\nBut we gotta think about enemy movement! He's at (7,6). Possible moves for him: UP (7,7), DOWN (7,5), LEFT (6,6), RIGHT (8,6). All safe for him too.\n\nHead-on collision risk? Our heads are 4 squares apart in x, 3 in y. If we both move toward each other, could we collide next turn? Let's check: If we go RIGHT to (4,3) and he goes LEFT to (6,6), still far. No immediate collision risk this turn.\n\nBut long-term: We need to grow to get longer than him, then force a head-on when we have length advantage. Right now equal length.\n\nShould we grab an apple? Closest apples: (4,1) down-right, (5,3) right-up, (1,1) down-left, (3,6) up. (3,6) is straight up 3 moves away. (5,3) is 2 moves right then up? Actually from (3,3), (5,3) is 2 right.\n\nI think we should move toward center control while maybe grabbing (5,3) soon. Going RIGHT to (4,3) puts us closer to (5,3) and central. Going UP to (3,4) also central but maybe less apple-focused.\n\nChat, what's the play? I want to pressure enemy space \u2014 he's in top-right. We should expand toward the middle-right to cut off his expansion.\n\nAlso think about future safe moves: From (4,3), next turn we could go UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT likely still safe. Good options.\n\nLet's go RIGHT \u2014 positions us better to intercept if he moves down-left, and we're closer to that apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n- Grab (5,3) apple next turn if safe.  \n- Watch enemy movement \u2014 if he goes for apples top-right, we keep building length and cut off his escape routes.  \n- Once we have length advantage, look for head-on collision opportunities.\n\nRIGHT",

No collision risk.\n- **DOWN**: (7,6) - Safe! Still clear.\n- **LEFT**: (6,7) - Safe! No issues.\n- **RIGHT**: (8,7) - Safe! No issues.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI\u2019m not going for apples yet\u2014this is about positioning. I want to cut off the enemy\u2019s escape routes and force a head-on collision. Right now, the enemy is far away, so I\u2019ll start by moving toward the center to control the board. **UP** to (7,8) is the best move\u2014it keeps me flexible and avoids the edge.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \n- Move toward the center to dominate space.  \n- Cut off the enemy\u2019s paths as they approach.  \n- Force a head-on collision if I can get ahead in score.  \n\nLet\u2019s go!  \n\nUP",

Apples everywhere but we stay focused on DOMINATION!\n\nCheck immediate moves:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (4,4) - Empty, safe.  \n**DOWN** \u2192 (4,2) - Empty, safe.  \n**LEFT** \u2192 (3,3) - Empty, safe.  \n**RIGHT** \u2192 (5,3) - APPLE at (5,3)! Eating would grow to length 2.\n\nAll four moves are safe \u2014 no bodies anywhere yet.\n\nBut think about enemy movement! He's at (7,7). Possible moves: UP (7,8) - apple at (8,8) nearby, DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7). All safe for him.\n\nHead-on collision risk? Our heads are 3 squares apart in x, 4 in y. If we go RIGHT to (5,3) and he goes LEFT to (6,7), still far. No immediate collision.\n\nBut chat \u2014 if we eat the apple now, we grow to length 2. That means next turn our tail stays at (4,3). That could limit our movement options slightly, but we gain length advantage over enemy if he doesn't eat.\n\nShould we take the apple? YES \u2014 content and length advantage! But wait\u2026 is there a trap? If we eat, our body occupies (4,3) and (5,3) next turn. From (5,3), our possible moves: UP (5,4), DOWN (5,2), LEFT (4,3) \u2014 that's our own body next turn! So LEFT would be suicide next turn. RIGHT (6,3) would be safe.\n\nSo eating the apple reduces our future safe moves from 4 to 3 next turn, but we gain length.\n\nAlternatively, if we DON'T eat now, we keep all options open, but enemy might eat and get length advantage.\n\nI think we TAKE THE APPLE! Get that length lead early. Then we can pressure enemy \u2014 once we're longer, we can force head-on collisions.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT to (5,3) puts us closer to center and more threatening to enemy's space.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n- After eating, avoid moving LEFT into our own body next turn.  \n- Watch enemy: if he eats an apple top-right, we still match length. If he doesn't, we're longer.  \n- Use length to cut off his movement options and force a crash.\n\nRIGHT \u2014 let's grab that apple and start growing! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

He's in the top-right corner. If we move UP and RIGHT over next few turns, we can slowly box him against the top wall.

Also keeps apple at (6,7) in range later.\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT \u2014 maintain pressure, keep options open, avoid moving into our body, and stay on the offensive! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

He's now longer than us! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVE CHECK:**\n- UP \u2192 (6,5) \u2014 Empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,3) \u2014 That's our OWN BODY! SUICIDE \u2192 ELIMINATE! \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,4) \u2014 Empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4) \u2014 Empty, safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nHe's at (8,9). Possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (8,9+1) = (8,10) \u2014 OFF THE BOARD! He dies if he goes up! \u274c  \nDOWN \u2192 (8,8) \u2014 That's his own body! \u274c  \nLEFT \u2192 (7,9) \u2014 Empty, safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9,9) \u2014 Empty, safe.\n\nHe CANNOT go UP or DOWN! He can only go LEFT or RIGHT! That's HUGE! He's TRAPPED against the top wall and his own body! \ud83d\ude31\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**  \nOur heads are (6,4) vs (8,9). Distance: 2 in x, 5 in y. No possible collision this turn.\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:**  \nHe's longer but stuck! This is our chance to move in and BOX HIM IN! If we move UP, we get closer to cutting off his escape downward later. If we move RIGHT, we get closer horizontally. But we need to think about his possible moves:  \nIf he goes LEFT to (7,9), he's still stuck up top. If he goes RIGHT to (9,9), he's in the corner. Either way, we want to position ourselves to block his path down the board.\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n- UP to (6,5): Moves us toward the top, closer to him. From (6,5), next turn we could go UP toward (6,6) (empty), LEFT, RIGHT. Puts us in a good spot to pressure.\n- LEFT to (5,4): Moves us away from him horizontally \u2014 too passive! We need to press the advantage while he's restricted! \u274c\n- RIGHT to (7,4): Moves us right, closer to the right side. From (7,4), we could go UP toward (7,5) (empty), RIGHT, DOWN. Also gets us closer.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nHe's stuck on the top row with only left/right moves. We need to move UP and RIGHT over the next turns to occupy cells BELOW him, like (7,8), (8,8) once his tail moves, etc. We want to cut off his access to the rest of the board and force him into a corner until he crashes! We can also grab apples to outgrow him, but SAFELY. The apple at (6,7) is above us \u2014 we could aim for it while boxing him.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nUP feels more direct \u2014 we're heading straight toward him and the top row. RIGHT also works, but UP reduces the y-distance faster. We need to be aggressive! Let's go UP and start climbing to cut off his downward escape!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:** UP \u2014 advance toward the trapped enemy, pressure him, and set up the BOX! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

We need to occupy the columns left of him (x=7, x=8) at medium y-levels to block him from moving left into the board. We can also aim to grab apples safely \u2014 (6,7) is above, (5,7) is nearby. But first, BOX HIM!  \nNext turn after RIGHT: head at (7,5).

We're still down by 1!\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVE CHECK:**\n- UP \u2192 (7,6) \u2014 Empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,4) \u2014 Empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,5) \u2014 That's our OWN BODY! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,5) \u2014 Empty, safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nHe's at (9,8) \u2014 stuck on the right wall!  \nFrom (9,8):  \nUP \u2192 (9,9) \u2014 That's his OWN NECK (his body segment after head)! \u274c  \nDOWN \u2192 (9,7) \u2014 Empty, safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8,8) \u2014 That's his TAIL? Wait, his body is [(9,9), (8,9)], so (8,8) is empty! Actually, check board: (8,8) is empty (shown as '.' on row 8 col 8). So LEFT to (8,8) is safe!  \nRIGHT \u2192 (10,8) \u2014 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n\nSo enemy has TWO safe moves: DOWN to (9,7) or LEFT to (8,8).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**  \nWe need to avoid moving into where his head could go.\n\nIf he goes DOWN to (9,7):  \nOur UP (7,6) \u2192 safe.  \nOur DOWN (7,4) \u2192 safe.  \nOur RIGHT (8,5) \u2192 safe.\n\nIf he goes LEFT to (8,8):  \nOur UP (7,6) \u2192 safe.  \nOur DOWN (7,4) \u2192 safe.  \nOur RIGHT (8,5) \u2192 (8,5) vs (8,8) different, safe.\n\nNo possible head-on collision this turn! Good.\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:**  \nWe want to box him in! He's on the right edge. If he goes LEFT to (8,8), he's trying to escape the wall. We need to cut off his leftward escape routes!\n\nOur moves:\n- UP to (7,6): Moves us toward top-center, near apple at (6,7). But doesn't pressure him horizontally.\n- DOWN to (7,4): Moves us away from him \u2014 too passive! \u274c\n- RIGHT to (8,5): CLOSES THE GAP! From (8,5), we're directly left of him if he goes to (8,8) or (9,7). Next turn we could go UP to (8,6) or RIGHT to (9,5) to further block.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nHe's trying to escape the right wall. We need to occupy the column x=8 at various y-levels to form a barrier. If we go RIGHT to (8,5), we're at y=5, he's at y=8. We can move up next turn to get closer in y. If he goes DOWN to (9,7), he's still stuck on the wall. If he goes LEFT to (8,8), we're on the same x but different y \u2014 we can chase vertically!\n\nAlso, we have length 2 vs his length 3. Head-on collision now would kill us both (tie in apples? He has 2, we have 1 \u2014 we lose!). So avoid direct head-on until we equalize apples.\n\n**APPLE OPPORTUNITIES:**  \nApple at (6,7) is close if we go UP now, but boxing him is priority! We can grab apples later after we trap him.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nRIGHT to (8,5) \u2014 aggressive positioning! We cut off his leftward escape and start building the BOX! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",
