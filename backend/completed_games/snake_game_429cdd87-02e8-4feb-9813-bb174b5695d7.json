Since I successfully moved UP last turn as planned, I'm now positioned to collect (6, 8) efficiently. This is critical because Snake #1 has 4 apples and I need to catch up quickly.\n\n**Safe moves:** UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN would hit my body at (7, 6))\n\n**Choosing UP** - This continues my planned route toward the (6, 8) apple. After moving UP to (7, 8), I'll be positioned to move LEFT then UP to collect the apple at (6, 8) on the following turn.\n\nUP",

This could lead to a potential conflict.\n- Moving DOWN to (5,4) moves me downward, away from the primary apple cluster but toward the apple at (4,0).\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) continues my optimal path toward the apple cluster at (7,5), (8,5), and (8,4).\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is at (7,6) and appears to be moving left/down based on its body position.

The enemy could potentially move DOWN to (7,5) or LEFT to (6,6), creating conflict.\n- DOWN: Safe but moves me away from the main apple targets.\n- RIGHT: Safe and continues my path toward multiple apples.

I'd collect it and grow - SAFE and REWARDING\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7, 5)**: This would crash into my own body segment at (7, 5) - UNSAFE!\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9, 5)**: Open space, no obstructions - SAFE\n\n**Critical threat analysis:**\nThe enemy snake head at (6, 4) is positioned such that:\n- If I go DOWN to (8, 4) for the apple, and the enemy goes RIGHT to (7, 4), then RIGHT again to (8, 4), we could both reach the same cell on the same turn - this would be a head-on collision!\n- However, the enemy has several options: they could go UP to (6, 5), RIGHT to (7, 4), or DOWN to (6, 3)\n\n**Distance advantage:**\nI'm 1 step away from the apple at (8, 4). The enemy is 3 steps away from (8, 4) via the path RIGHT-RIGHT-RIGHT or RIGHT-UP-RIGHT. However, there's a potential collision risk if the enemy moves RIGHT this turn to (7, 4), placing them 2 steps away.\n\n**Safe moves:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\n**Strategic choice:**\nDOWN to (8, 4) is highly tempting - it's an immediate apple collection that would tie me with the enemy at 7 apples each. However, the collision risk with the enemy is concerning.\n\nLet me consider the safer alternatives:\n- UP to (8, 6): Leads up toward (4, 8), keeping distance from the enemy\n- RIGHT to (9, 5): Moves away from immediate threats but away from most apples\n\nActually, I have a strong incentive to collect this apple. The enemy might not even move toward this apple, and even if they do, I have the distance advantage. The collision would only happen if they take exactly the right path.\n\n**Decision:** I'll go for the apple at (8, 4). This brings me to 7 apples (tying with the enemy), grows my snake, and positions me well for future moves.\n\nDOWN",

The bottom row (y=0) has limited space, so I need to be careful not to trap myself. The enemy snake has more apples (9 vs my soon-to-be 9), so I need to catch up.\n\nLEFT",

Only UP and LEFT are safe.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- LEFT moves me to (1, 0), which is safe but doesn't collect an apple.\n- UP moves me to (2, 1), which is safe and doesn't collect an apple.\n- There are no apples immediately adjacent to my head. The closest apples are (2,4) and (3,4) above me, and (2,9) far above.\n- The enemy snake is at (7,8) and far away, so no immediate collision risk.\n- After moving UP to (2,1), I can continue upward toward (2,4) or (3,4). Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,0) might lead to a dead-end in the bottom-left corner (0,0) and (0,1) are free, but it limits future options.\n- UP opens more paths: from (2,1) I can go UP to (2,2), LEFT to (1,1), or RIGHT to (3,1). This keeps flexibility.\n- LEFT to (1,0) only allows UP to (1,1) or LEFT to (0,0) (which then only has UP to (0,1)), which is more restrictive.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Both moves are safe this turn.\n- UP provides better future mobility and access to apples (2,4) and (3,4) which are only 3-4 moves away.\n- LEFT leads to a corner which might trap me later.\n\nLong-term plan:\nMove upward toward the apples at (2,4) and (3,4). Avoid the bottom row to prevent getting trapped. The enemy is far and has apples near it (4,8) and (8,3), so we are not competing directly yet. Focus on efficient collection while maintaining open space.\n\nUP is the best move for future flexibility and progress toward apples.\n\nUP",

UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- The nearest apples are at (2,4) and (3,4), both very close.\n- UP to (2,3) is the most direct step toward (2,4). From (2,3), I can go UP to (2,4) to eat the apple.\n- RIGHT to (3,2) also leads to (3,4) via (3,3), but it's slightly less direct.\n- LEFT to (1,2) moves away from the apples and into a less dense area with fewer options.\n- The enemy snake is far away at (6,9) and not an immediate threat.\n- After eating (2,4), I can easily reach (3,4) next or consider other apples.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- All three moves are safe this turn.\n- UP is optimal for quickly reaching the apple at (2,4).\n- Moving LEFT might lead to a dead-end in the left corner (x=0) and limit future options.\n- Moving RIGHT is also good but slightly less efficient for (2,4).\n\nLong-term plan:\nContinue moving upward to collect (2,4) and then (3,4). After that, consider apples at (4,8) or (2,9). Avoid moving left into the corner. The enemy is far and occupied with its own apples. Stay efficient and keep options open.\n\nUP is the best move to directly approach the nearest apple.\n\nUP",

UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- The closest apple is at (3,6) - two moves away (UP then UP).\n- Another apple at (2,9) is also reachable but further.\n- The enemy snake is at (4,8) and not an immediate threat to my current position.\n- My body occupies a large area on the left and bottom, so moving RIGHT or UP opens more space.\n- Moving DOWN to (3,3) is safe but leads to a corner with fewer options (x=3,y=3 has neighbors: (3,2) is free? Actually, (3,2) is empty? Looking at board: row 2 has at x=3: \".\" so yes empty. But (3,3) itself is empty. However, moving DOWN might be less strategic as it doesn't progress toward apples.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- All three moves are safe this turn.\n- Next turn, from (3,5): possible moves? UP to (3,6) has apple. LEFT to (2,5) empty, RIGHT to (4,5) empty, DOWN to (3,4) is my body? Actually, after moving UP, my body will have grown? Wait: I just ate an apple last turn? Yes, I moved RIGHT to (3,4) and ate the apple there. So now my body has grown by one segment. But the board state shows my head at (3,4) and body starting at (2,4). So after moving UP to (3,5), my new head is (3,5), and my body becomes [ (3,4), (2,4), ... ] so (3,4) is now occupied. So from (3,5), DOWN would be into (3,4) which is my body - so not safe next turn. Similarly, from (4,4) after RIGHT: next turn, DOWN to (4,3) empty? But LEFT to (3,4) is my body? Actually, after RIGHT, my body becomes [ (3,4), (2,4), ... ] so (3,4) is occupied. So from (4,4), LEFT is not safe next turn.\n- Therefore, to keep options open, UP is best because it moves toward the apple at (3,6) and from (3,5) I can go UP to (3,6) to eat the apple, or LEFT/RIGHT to avoid trapping myself.\n\nLong-term plan:\nEat the apple at (3,6) next. Then consider moving toward (2,9) or (0,8). Avoid moving into the enemy's territory (right side) as snake #0 is long and might block. My body is mostly on the left, so staying left is safer. After eating (3,6), I can go to (2,6) or (4,6) to set up for (2,9).\n\nUP is the best move to progress toward the nearest apple and maintain flexibility.\n\nUP",

RIGHT to (4,8) is its own body. So enemy can go UP, DOWN, LEFT. It might go DOWN to (3,7) to approach the apple at (3,6)? But that would take two moves. This turn, enemy cannot reach (3,6) from (3,8) in one move. So no immediate collision risk at (3,6).\n- Moving LEFT to (2,5) or RIGHT to (4,5) avoids the apple but keeps me safe. However, eating the apple is beneficial for score and growth.\n- After eating the apple at (3,6), my head will be at (3,6) and my body becomes [ (3,5), (3,4), ... ]. Then next turn, from (3,6): possible moves? UP to (3,7) empty, DOWN to (3,5) my body (not safe), LEFT to (2,6) empty, RIGHT to (4,6) empty. So I'll have three options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). This is good.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT now would delay eating the apple, and the enemy might get it first? But enemy is farther away. However, eating it now is efficient.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- UP is safe and gets an apple.\n- LEFT and RIGHT are safe but don't progress toward an apple immediately.\n- The enemy is not a direct threat to (3,6) this turn.\n\nLong-term plan:\nEat the apple at (3,6) this turn. Then next turn, consider moving UP to (3,7) to approach (2,9) or (0,8), or LEFT to (2,6) to stay in left area. Avoid moving right where enemy is strong. After eating, I'll have 13 apples vs enemy's 11, so I'm leading.\n\nUP is the best move to gain an apple and extend my lead.\n\nUP",

UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- I just ate an apple at (3,6) last turn (as per last rationale), so my body grew and now my head is at (3,6). There are no apples adjacent to me now.\n- The closest apples are at (2,9) (above left), (1,3) (below left), (0,8) (far left top), (8,3) (far right bottom), and (9,3) (far right bottom).\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (2,8). Its head is close to the apple at (2,9). It might go UP to (2,9) to eat that apple this turn.\n- From my position (3,6), moving UP to (3,7) gets me closer to (2,9) but the enemy is also targeting that. However, if enemy eats (2,9) this turn, it will grow and its body will block that area.\n- Moving LEFT to (2,6) keeps me in the left side, where there are apples at (1,3) and (0,8). This might be safer and less contested.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,6) moves me toward the enemy's territory (right side) where there are apples at (8,3) and (9,3), but enemy is strong there with a long body.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- UP: (3,7) is safe. But enemy at (2,8) might also move UP to (2,9) or LEFT to (1,8) or DOWN to (2,7). There is no direct collision risk this turn. However, next turn from (3,7), I could go to (2,7) or (3,8) or (4,7). But (3,8) is enemy body? Actually, enemy body has (3,8) as its second segment. So moving to (3,8) next turn would kill me. So UP is safe this turn but might limit next moves.\n- LEFT: (2,6) is safe. This moves me away from enemy and toward the left apples. From (2,6), next moves: UP to (2,7) empty, DOWN to (2,5) empty, LEFT to (1,6) empty. All safe. This opens up more options.\n- RIGHT: (4,6) is safe. But this moves me closer to enemy body segments. From (4,6), next moves: UP to (4,7) empty, DOWN to (4,5) empty, RIGHT to (5,6) empty. However, enemy is strong on the right, so this might be risky long-term.\n\nLong-term plan:\nI should avoid the enemy and target the less contested apples on the left. The apples at (1,3) and (0,8) are reachable. Also, my body is mostly on the left and bottom, so staying left is consistent.\n\nLEFT is the best move to safely approach the left apples and avoid the enemy.\n\nLEFT",

Moving UP to (2,7) gets me closer to the enemy head at (2,9). But enemy might move away. However, if enemy goes LEFT to (1,9), it might come down later.\n- Moving DOWN to (2,5) gets me closer to the apple at (1,3) and (6,2). But (6,2) is also near my body (tail at (5,2)).\n- Moving LEFT to (1,6) is safe and moves me toward the left apples (1,3) and (0,8). This seems promising.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- UP: (2,7) is safe. But enemy is at (2,9). If enemy goes LEFT to (1,9), it is not a direct threat. If enemy goes RIGHT to (3,9), it is also not direct. However, from (2,7), I could go to (2,8) next turn? But (2,8) is enemy body. So UP is safe this turn but next turn might be risky.\n- DOWN: (2,5) is safe. This moves me toward the apple at (1,3). From (2,5), next moves: UP to (2,6) (my body), DOWN to (2,4) (my body), LEFT to (1,5) empty, RIGHT to (3,5) (my body). So only LEFT is safe next turn. This is limiting.\n- LEFT: (1,6) is safe. From (1,6), next moves: UP to (1,7) empty, DOWN to (1,5) empty, LEFT to (0,6) empty. All safe. This gives more options.\n\nLong-term plan:\nI should target the apples on the left: (1,3) and (0,8). Moving LEFT to (1,6) is the best step toward that. It also avoids the enemy and keeps multiple safe moves for the next turn.\n\nLEFT",

UP, DOWN, and LEFT are safe.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- The enemy snake #0 is at (1,9). Its possible moves: UP (1,10) off board (invalid), DOWN (1,8) which is empty? From the board state, (1,8) is empty (shown as '.'). LEFT (0,9) empty, RIGHT (2,9) which is its own body. So enemy can go DOWN to (1,8) or LEFT to (0,9). It cannot go RIGHT (into body) or UP (off board). So enemy will likely go DOWN or LEFT.\n- I am at (1,6). Moving UP to (1,7) gets me closer to the enemy head at (1,9). If enemy goes DOWN to (1,8), it will be adjacent to me next turn. This is risky.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,5) gets me closer to the apple at (1,3). This is a direct path to an apple.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,6) is safe and moves me toward the left apple (0,8) but also away from (1,3). However, (0,8) is far and requires going up.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- UP: (1,7) is safe this turn. But next turn, if enemy goes DOWN to (1,8), it will be adjacent. I might be forced to avoid it. This could lead to a head-on collision risk if both move toward each other.\n- DOWN: (1,5) is safe. This moves me directly toward the apple at (1,3). From (1,5), next moves: UP to (1,6) (my body), DOWN to (1,4) empty, LEFT to (0,5) empty, RIGHT to (2,5) (my body). So only DOWN and LEFT are safe. This is somewhat limiting but acceptable.\n- LEFT: (0,6) is safe. From (0,6), next moves: UP to (0,7) empty, DOWN to (0,5) empty, LEFT off board (invalid), RIGHT to (1,6) (my body). So only UP and DOWN are safe. This is also limiting.\n\nLong-term plan:\nI should target the closest apple at (1,3). Moving DOWN to (1,5) is the best step toward that. It avoids the enemy (which is above) and gets me closer to the apple. The enemy is unlikely to come down immediately since it has apples above (like (0,8)) but it might not prioritize that. My score is higher (13 vs 12), so I should play safely and collect apples.\n\nDOWN",

From (1,4), next moves: UP to (1,5) (my body), DOWN to (1,3) (apple), LEFT to (0,4) empty, RIGHT to (2,4) (my body). So only DOWN and LEFT are safe. Moving DOWN to (1,3) would eat the apple. This is good.\n- LEFT: (0,5) is safe. From (0,5), next moves: UP to (0,6) empty, DOWN to (0,4) empty, LEFT off board (invalid), RIGHT to (1,5) (my body). So only UP and DOWN are safe. This is limiting and doesn't progress toward an apple.\n\nLong-term plan:\nI should target the closest apple at (1,3). Moving DOWN to (1,4) is the best step toward that. It avoids the enemy (which is going to (0,8)) and gets me closer to the apple. Next turn, I can move DOWN to (1,3) to eat the apple. The enemy will be at (0,8) and not a direct threat. My score is higher (13 vs 12), and I can increase it to 14.\n\nDOWN",

If I move here, I eat it and grow.\n- LEFT: (0,4) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,4) - contains my own body segment (part of the body), would die.\n\nSo UP and RIGHT are eliminated. Only DOWN and LEFT are safe.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- The enemy snake #0 is at (0,8). Its possible moves: UP (0,9) which is its own body, DOWN (0,7) empty, LEFT off board (invalid), RIGHT (1,8) empty. So enemy can go DOWN or RIGHT. It cannot go UP (into body) or LEFT (off board). It might go DOWN to (0,7) or RIGHT to (1,8). Note: There is an apple at (9,8) which is far away, and (8,3) etc., but enemy is not near any apple immediately.\n- I am at (1,4). Moving DOWN to (1,3) eats the apple at (1,3). This is highly beneficial: I gain an apple (score becomes 14 vs enemy's 13) and grow. My tail will extend, but I avoid immediate danger.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,4) is safe but doesn't eat an apple. From (0,4), next moves: UP (0,5) empty, DOWN (0,3) empty, LEFT off board (invalid), RIGHT (1,4) (my body). So only UP and DOWN are safe. This is limiting and doesn't progress toward another apple quickly.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- DOWN: (1,3) has an apple. Eating it is safe. After eating, my head will be at (1,3) and I grow by 1. The new tail position? My current tail is at (4,0). After moving, the body will be: head at (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), ... and the tail remains (4,0) until next move (since growth adds a segment at the tail). So no immediate risk.\n- LEFT: (0,4) is safe but no apple. This delays eating and might allow enemy to get ahead.\n\nLong-term plan:\nI should eat the apple at (1,3) immediately. This increases my score to 14, giving me a lead. After eating, I can plan to go to other apples like (6,2) or (8,3). The enemy is at (0,8) and not a direct threat to me at (1,3). My path to (6,2) is open: I can go right and down after eating.\n\nNote: The enemy might move to (1,8) or (0,7). If it goes to (1,8), it is closer to the apple at (9,8) but still far. I am not in its path.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move to eat the apple and gain an advantage.\n\nDOWN",

Its possible moves: UP (1,9) which is its own body, DOWN (1,7) empty, LEFT (0,8) its own body, RIGHT (2,8) its own body. So enemy can only go DOWN to (1,7) to avoid death. It has no other safe moves. Therefore, enemy will move DOWN to (1,7).\n- I am at (1,3). Moving DOWN to (1,2) is safe and moves me toward the apple at (6,2) (though it's far). Moving LEFT to (0,3) is safe but doesn't progress toward an apple directly.\n- After moving DOWN to (1,2), next moves: UP (1,3) my body, DOWN (1,1) empty, LEFT (0,2) empty, RIGHT (2,2) my body. So only DOWN and LEFT are safe. This is limiting.\n- After moving LEFT to (0,3), next moves: UP (0,4) has an apple! DOWN (0,2) empty, LEFT off board (invalid), RIGHT (1,3) my body. So UP and DOWN are safe. UP leads to an apple at (0,4).\n\nRisk assessment:\n- DOWN: (1,2) is safe but doesn't eat an apple. It leads to a position with only two safe moves (DOWN and LEFT) next turn.\n- LEFT: (0,3) is safe and sets me up to eat the apple at (0,4) next turn (by moving UP). This is highly beneficial: I gain an apple (score becomes 15 vs enemy's 13) and grow. Also, the enemy is forced to move DOWN to (1,7), which is far away and not a threat.\n\nLong-term plan:\nI should move LEFT to (0,3) to position myself to eat the apple at (0,4) next turn. This increases my score to 15, extending my lead. After eating, I can plan to go to other apples like (6,2) or (8,3). The enemy is trapped in the top-right and has limited moves; it might die soon if it runs out of space.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move to set up for the apple at (0,4) and avoid getting stuck in a dead-end.\n\nLEFT",

Only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- UP leads directly to eating the apple at (0,4).

After eating, I'll be at (0,4) with a longer body. Next turn, I'll need to avoid moving backwards into my own body. The safe moves from (0,4) will be UP (0,5) and possibly others if not blocked.

My body segments are: [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0)].\nApples are at: (8,3), (9,3), (6,2), (9,8), (5,2).\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (0,7) with body [(1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9)].\n\nPossible moves from (0,4):\n- UP: (0,5) - empty, safe.\n- DOWN: (0,3) - contains my own body segment (immediately behind head), would die.\n- LEFT: (-1,4) - off board, would die.\n- RIGHT: (1,4) - contains my own body segment, would die.\n\nSo only UP is safe.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- UP is the only option, moving to (0,5). This doesn't eat an apple but keeps me alive.\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (0,7). Its possible moves: UP (0,8) its own body, DOWN (0,6) empty, LEFT off board, RIGHT (1,7) its own body. So enemy only has DOWN as a safe move. It will likely go to (0,6).\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Moving UP to (0,5) is safe and avoids immediate death.\n- Next turn from (0,5): UP (0,6) might be occupied by enemy if it moves DOWN, DOWN (0,4) my body, LEFT off board, RIGHT (1,5) my body. So only UP might be safe if enemy doesn't go there, but if enemy moves DOWN to (0,6), then UP would cause a head-on collision. Alternatively, if enemy doesn't go to (0,6), UP would be safe. But since enemy only has DOWN as an option, it will almost certainly go to (0,6). Therefore, next turn I might have no safe moves if enemy is at (0,6).\n\nLong-term plan:\nI need to escape this corner. After moving to (0,5), I should try to go right if possible in future turns. However, my body blocks right moves. I might need to wait for my tail to move away. The enemy is trapped similarly and might die if it hits a wall or itself. I have a lead in apples (15 vs 13), so surviving is key. If both snakes get stuck, I win by having more apples.\n\nFor now, UP is the only move to survive this turn.\n\nUP",

Check possible moves from (0, 5):**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (0, 6) \u2192 currently occupied by enemy head (0, 6) \u2192 If both move there, head-on collision \u2192 both die \u2192 bad.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (0, 4) \u2192 my body \u2192 die immediately.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (-1, 5) \u2192 off board \u2192 die.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 my body \u2192 die.\n\nSo all four moves seem deadly? Wait, check UP again carefully.  \n\nThe rules: If two snakes move into the same cell at the same time, both die. So **UP** is not safe *if* enemy moves into (0, 6) from (0, 6) \u2014 but he can't stay there; he must move somewhere. So consider **enemy's possible moves** from (0, 6):\n\nEnemy #0 head at (0, 6), body: [(0, 7), ...]  \n\nEnemy moves:  \n- UP (0, 7) \u2192 occupied by body \u2192 die.  \n- DOWN (0, 5) \u2192 my head is here currently \u2192 but simultaneous move: if enemy moves DOWN and I move UP, potential head-on collision at (0, 6)? No, that's wrong \u2014 let's check step by step:\n\nActually if I move UP to (0, 6) and enemy moves DOWN to (0, 5), we both cross paths without landing on the same cell (since moves are simultaneous, heads swap positions if speeds are one cell per turn). But rules say: collision only if two heads occupy the *same cell* after moves. So in that case, I\u2019d end at (0, 6), he\u2019d end at (0, 5) \u2014 no collision.  \n\nWait, but at the start of the turn, enemy head is at (0, 6). After moves: he is at new_pos, I am at my new_pos. What if I move to where he currently is? It's allowed if he leaves it. When does head-on collision happen? Only if we choose moves such that our new heads are in the same cell.  \n\nIf I go UP to (0, 6) and he stays still (impossible because staying still isn\u2019t a move; he must move one cell). Where can he move? Only DOWN to (0, 5) or RIGHT to (1, 6) or LEFT off board.  \n\nCheck his safe moves from (0, 6):  \nDown: (0, 5) \u2014 contains my head currently? But my head will move, so after movement, (0, 5) will be empty if I move away. But if he moves down to (0, 5), does he collide with me? That depends on where I go. If we swap (me up to 0,6, him down to 0,5), both safe.  \n\nRight: (1, 6) \u2014 check if occupied by body: his body is at (0,7), (1,7), etc.; (1,6) is empty.  \n\nLeft: (-1, 6) off board \u2192 die.  \n\nUp: (0, 7) occupied by his body segment -> die.  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN (0, 5) or RIGHT (1, 6).  \n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT (1, 6), then (0, 6) is free, so I can go UP safely.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN (0, 5), then (0, 5) is his new head, my old head location, and he doesn't die unless I\u2019m still there \u2014 but I\u2019d be moving to (0, 6). So no collision.  \n\nTherefore UP is safe because the only way I'd die in UP is if enemy stays in (0, 6) (impossible) or if enemy moves UP (impossible because his up is body) or if he also moves UP (no). Actually, if enemy moves DOWN, our heads swap cells \u2014 no problem.  \n\nWait, re-read rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"  \nEnemy's current head location (0,6) counts as his head, not body until he moves. If I move into a cell containing another snake's head at the start of the turn, is that illegal?  \n\nLet's check: The rules only say \"If your head moves into any snake's body\u2026 you die\" \u2014 they don't say \"head\" there, but head-on collision rule is separate: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" So moving into a cell occupied by an enemy head at turn start would cause collision if he also moves into that same cell? No \u2014 if he moves away, cell empty \u2014 so allowed? Actually, my movement is into his current head cell \u2014 but not necessarily colliding if he leaves. That's standard Snake rules: you can pass through where an enemy head was at turn start.\n\nThus: UP is legal and safe.  \n\nLet's confirm other moves again:  \nDOWN: my body at (0,4) \u2192 die.  \nLEFT: off board \u2192 die.  \nRIGHT: my body at (1,5) \u2192 die.  \n\nSo only UP is possible.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Risk assessment**  \n\nFrom (0,6) next turn: I could go UP to (0,7) \u2014 enemy body (from turn-start positions: (0,7) is enemy #0 body), so not safe unless it moves. Likely next turn I'd have to go RIGHT to (1,6) if possible, but must check next turn.  \n\nGiven only one move possible, no choice.  \n\n**3. Long-term plan note**  \n\nSnake #0 blocked similarly. I need to escape the top-left corner by going right as soon as possible. Wait for my tail (2,0) to move away so that space frees up. Avoid staying next to enemy head to prevent future zero-move situations.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move**  \nUP",

This is a critical situation. However, I need to reconsider what happens when two snakes move simultaneously.\n\n**Re-evaluating the collision scenarios:**\n- If I move DOWN to (0, 5) and enemy snake #1 also moves, it might vacate (0, 5)\n- If I move RIGHT to (1, 6) and enemy snake #1 moves, it might vacate (1, 6)\n\n**Enemy snake #1's likely moves from (0, 5):**\nLooking at enemy snake #1's position: Head at (0, 5), Body: [(0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), ...]\n- UP \u2192 (0, 6): Would hit my head (conflict with me), probably won't choose this\n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 4): Contains its own body at row 1 - would hit itself\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 5): Off the board - would die\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 5): Contains its own body at row 4 - would hit itself\n\nThe enemy snake #1 has NO safe moves! This means snake #1 is guaranteed to die this turn, regardless of what I do. Given this realization:\n\n**My best strategy:**\nSince snake #1 will die, I can choose any move that doesn't kill me on my own. However, I still need to avoid moves that would definitely kill me:\n- UP to (0, 7): My own body - death\n- LEFT to (-1, 6): Off the board - death\n\nThis leaves me with two potential options:\n- **DOWN \u2192 (0, 5)**: Currently occupied by snake #1's head, but snake #1 will die this turn, so this space will become free\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (1, 6)**: Currently occupied by snake #1's body at row 6, but snake #1 will die, so this space will become free\n\n**Choosing the best move:**\nSince snake #1 is guaranteed to die, I should move toward the nearest apple at (0, 4), which means moving DOWN to (0, 5) puts me one step closer. This is strategically the best direction.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nSnake #1 is trapped and will die this turn, giving me a significant advantage. After it dies, I'll have the board mostly to myself. My immediate priority should be to collect the apple at (0, 4), then work my way toward the other apples on the board, particularly the cluster at (5, 2), (6, 2), and the ones on the right side at (8, 3), (9, 3), and (9, 8). I should be careful not to trap myself in the left edge and gradually move toward more open areas for better maneuverability.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",
