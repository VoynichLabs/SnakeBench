We've deduced that out of the current available apples, that one is the most immediate target.\n\nOnce we grasp the apple, our new body part will appear at (5, 8) as well. That will result in two parts of our snake at the same spot, but we can't help that right now. \n\nAfter growing, the next vitamin-rich apple to aim for would logically be (4, 8) if it's still free. Then, after grabbing that, we should pivot back to start heading for (3, 7) and (0, 9) in that sequence. \n\nHowever, as of now, the highest priority is the apple at (5, 8), so our next commanded action remains the same.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",

Moving right again will take me to (10, 6), which is out of bounds. So, I can't move right. Moving left would take me to (8, 6). Moving up would take me to (9, 7), which is occupied by Snake #0 and would result in a collision/death. Moving down would take me to (9, 7), which is occupied by Snake #0 and would result in a collision/death.\n\nI need to avoid Snake #0. The best option seems to be to move left, which will take me to (8,6). This is a safe move, and I can then plan my next move to approach the apple. \n\nStrategy for next turn: Move towards the apple avoiding snake #0.\n\nNext move: LEFT",
