Moving right is disallowed because that would move outside the board (since 9 is the maximum index), so right isn't an option.\n- Moving down to (9, 4) seems safe and straightforward, taking me closer to apples at higher y-coordinates.\n- Moving up to (9, 6) might be risky because there's an apple at (5, 6) and walls at the top (y=9), but moving directly up doesn't lead to an immediate danger.\n- Moving left from (9, 5) to (8, 5): clear, not near walls or enemies.\n- Moving down from (9, 5) to (9, 4): also clear, but might take longer to reach apples.\n- Moving left to (8, 5): closer to apples at (5, 6) and (4, 5), perhaps better for quick collection.\n\nConsidering the positions:\n\n- The apple at (5, 6) is up and left from the current position; moving left then up would reach close.\n- The apple at (4, 5) is directly to my left at (8, 5) \u2014 well, actually, at (4, 5). So, moving left toward (8, 5), then left again to (7, 5), etc., could get me closer.\n- But if I move left now to (8,5), then next turn to (7,5), I can keep heading towards (5,6), which is up and to the left.\n\nHowever, to avoid complications, moving left immediately seems safe and leads me closer to the (4,5) apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up isn't immediately blocked, and it might be more direct to apple at (5,6). Moving up from (9,5) to (9,6), then left toward (5,6), is an option, but it takes more steps.\n\nGiven the current positions and the need to prioritize safety and gathering apples, choosing to move LEFT seems optimal. It opens a path towards the (4, 5) apple and is a safe initial move, with good prospects for further movement.\n\nNext, I will select LEFT as my move.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

Both are currently empty and could be options for maneuvering later, but they don't provide immediate benefit.\n- Moving DOWN from (3, 7) would go to (3, 6), which the snake's body occupies (as the body is at (3, 6) and (3, 7)). Moving down would cause a collision, so that move is unsafe.\n\nConsidering the current position and the goal of quickly consuming the adjacent apple, moving UP seems to be the optimal choice:\n\n- It results in immediate apple consumption.\n- It positions the snake favorably for future moves toward the other nearby apples, especially (5, 6), which is to the right.\n\nNext, after consuming the apple at (3, 8), I can plan a route toward (5, 6), likely moving RIGHT then UP or LEFT depending on the situation at that time.\n\n**Decided next move: UP**",
