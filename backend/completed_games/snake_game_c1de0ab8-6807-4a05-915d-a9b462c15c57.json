Let me check distances:\n- My distance to (2, 9): 3 moves left\n- Enemy distance to (2, 9): 1 right + 2 up = 3 moves\n\nIt's a race! But there's risk of collision if we both go for it.\n\nApple at (6, 7) is safer - enemy is far from it:\n- My distance: 3 moves (right 1, down 2)\n- Enemy distance: 5 right + 0 up = 5 moves minimum\n\nGoing DOWN toward (6, 7) seems safer and keeps my options open. From (5, 8), I can go right toward (6, 7) or continue assessing.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Head toward (6, 7) first as it's safer from enemy competition. Then target (7, 4) and (7, 1) on the right side.

ELIMINATED.\n\n2. **DOWN:** Would take me to (9, 8) - Safe, open space. This continues my path down the right edge toward apples at (9, 1) and (9, 0).\n\n3. **LEFT:** Would take me to (8, 9) - That's where my body is! ELIMINATED.\n\n4. **RIGHT:** Would take me to (10, 9) - OFF THE BOARD! ELIMINATED.\n\n**Only safe move: DOWN**\n\nThis works perfectly with my strategy from last turn! I'm now in the corner at (9, 9) and my only option is to go DOWN, which is exactly what I wanted to do anyway - descend along the right edge to collect the apples at (9, 1) and (9, 0).\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- Enemy head at (3, 5), body at (3, 6) and (3, 7)\n- They're on the left side of the board, no collision risk\n- We're both at 2 apples, tied score\n\n**Path forward:**\nFrom (9, 8), I'll continue DOWN along the right edge. The path is completely clear:\n- (9, 9) \u2192 (9, 8) \u2192 (9, 7) \u2192 ... \u2192 (9, 1) [apple!] \u2192 (9, 0) [apple!]\n\nThat's 8 moves to reach (9, 1) and 9 moves to reach (9, 0). After collecting those, I can go LEFT toward (7, 0), (7, 1), and (7, 4).\n\n**Strategy note for future turns:**\nContinue DOWN along the right edge. Target apples in order: (9, 1), (9, 0), then work toward (7, 0), (7, 1), and (7, 4). Keep an eye on the enemy snake's position but they're currently far away on the left side.\n\nDOWN",

ELIMINATED.\n\n**Safe moves: DOWN or LEFT**\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- Enemy head at (6, 4) is 1 move from (7, 4) if they go RIGHT\n- Enemy is almost certainly going for (7, 4) this turn\n- If I go LEFT to (8, 5), I'd still be 2 moves from (7, 4)... but enemy might get it first\n\n**Distance to apples:**\n- From (9, 5) to (9, 1): 4 moves down\n- From (9, 5) to (9, 0): 5 moves down\n- From (9, 5) to (7, 4): 2 left + 1 down = 3 moves\n\n**Head Collision Risk:**\n- If I go LEFT to (8, 5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (7, 4), we don't collide\n- If I go DOWN to (9, 4) and enemy goes RIGHT to (7, 4), no collision risk\n\n**Escape Route Consideration:**\nGoing DOWN continues along the right edge toward 4 apples (9,1), (9,0), (7,0), (7,1). I need to be careful not to trap myself in the corner though.\n\nIf I go DOWN now to (9, 4), next turn I could:\n- Continue DOWN toward apples\n- Go LEFT to avoid being trapped\n\nThe enemy will likely take (7, 4) this turn. That's fine - I'll secure the bottom-right cluster which has more apples anyway.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\nContinue DOWN to (9, 4), then (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1) to grab that apple, then (9, 0) for another apple. After that, sweep LEFT to (8, 0), (7, 0) for another apple, and potentially up to (7, 1). This gives me 4 apples with low competition. Need to maintain escape routes - after collecting, head up or left to avoid corner trap.\n\nDOWN",

If I keep going down, I need to make sure I can escape. After collecting apples at (9, 1) and (9, 0), I can go LEFT to (8, 0), (7, 0) for another apple.\n\n**Risk Assessment of LEFT:**\nIf enemy unexpectedly goes RIGHT, we'd collide at (8, 4). Both die. I'm behind in apples (2 vs 3), so mutual death is bad for me. Enemy is more likely going for (7, 1) or (7, 0) though.\n\nGoing DOWN is safer - no collision risk and maintains my path to the apple cluster.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\nContinue DOWN to (9, 3), then (9, 2), (9, 1) to grab apple, then (9, 0) for another.

Both would die.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nGoing DOWN is clearly safer - no collision risk at all since enemy is 2 columns away.\nGoing LEFT has collision risk if enemy decides to move right.\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\n- DOWN keeps me on track for apples at (9, 1) and (9, 0)\n- I'm currently behind (2 vs 3 apples), so I need to collect efficiently\n- The right column has 2 apples I can grab in the next few moves\n- Enemy will likely go for (7, 1) and (7, 0)\n\n**Path forward:**\n- This turn: DOWN to (9, 2)\n- Next turn: DOWN to (9, 1) - collect apple!\n- Then: DOWN to (9, 0) - collect another apple!\n- Then: LEFT to (8, 0), then possibly (7, 0) if enemy hasn't taken it\n\n**Concern about being trapped:**\nAfter reaching corner (9, 0), I need to ensure I can escape left. My body will be shorter by then as segments move. Should be fine.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\nContinue DOWN to collect (9, 1) and (9, 0). Watch for enemy movement.

          "rationale": "<budget:thinking>\nLet me analyze the current situation:\n\n**My Position:** Head at (9, 1), Body at [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)]\n**Enemy Position:** Head at (7, 1), Body at [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)]\n\n**Apple Locations:**\n- (9, 0) - 1 down from me (directly below!)\n- (7, 0) - bottom, left of me\n- (0, 6) - far left\n- (3, 4) - middle area\n- (9, 9) - top right corner\n\n**Evaluating moves from (9, 1):**\n\n1. **UP:** Would take me to (9, 2) - That's my own body! ELIMINATED.\n\n2. **DOWN:** Would take me to (9, 0) - There's an APPLE here! Safe move, collects apple.\n\n3. **LEFT:** Would take me to (8, 1) - Safe, open space.\n\n4. **RIGHT:** Would take me to (10, 1) - OFF THE BOARD! ELIMINATED.\n\n**Safe moves: DOWN or LEFT**\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- Enemy head at (7, 1) is right next to apple at (7, 0)\n- Enemy will likely go DOWN to (7, 0) to collect that apple\n- Enemy could also go LEFT to (6, 1) or RIGHT to (8, 1)\n\n**Head Collision Risk Check:**\n- If I go DOWN to (9, 0): Enemy can't reach (9, 0) in one move from (7, 1). SAFE + APPLE!\n- If I go LEFT to (8, 1): Enemy could go RIGHT to (8, 1). COLLISION RISK!\n\n**Corner Trap Analysis:**\nIf I go DOWN to (9, 0), I'm in the corner. My body will be at (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3). \n- From (9, 0), my only option would be LEFT to (8, 0) since:\n  - UP to (9, 1) - my own body would be there\n  - RIGHT is off-board\n  - DOWN is off-board\n\nWait, let me recalculate. If I move DOWN to (9, 0):\n- My new body: Head at (9, 0), then (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4) because I eat an apple and grow\n- So next turn from (9, 0):\n  - UP to (9, 1) - that's my body! BAD\n  - LEFT to (8, 0) - open, SAFE\n  - DOWN/RIGHT - off-board\n\nSo LEFT to (8, 0) is my only safe escape from corner. Let me check if enemy could block me:\n- If enemy goes to (7, 0) this turn, next turn they could potentially go to (8, 0)\n- But we'd both be moving to (8, 0) simultaneously - that'd be a head collision!\n\nActually wait, let me think more carefully. After this turn:\n- If I go DOWN: I'm at (9, 0), body at (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4) [grew from apple]\n- If enemy goes DOWN: They're at (7, 0), body at (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4) [grew from apple]\n\nNext turn:\n- My only option is LEFT to (8, 0)\n- Enemy from (7, 0) could go UP to (7, 1) [their body], LEFT to (6, 0), or RIGHT to (8, 0)\n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (8, 0) and I go LEFT to (8, 0), we'd have a HEAD COLLISION - both die!\n- But I have 3 apples, they have 4 apples - they'd win if we both die!\n\nThis is risky! Let me reconsider...\n\nAlternative: Go LEFT now to (8, 1)\n- Risk of head collision with enemy if they go RIGHT from (7, 1)\n- But they're likely going DOWN to get the apple at (7, 0)\n\nLet me assess what enemy is most likely to do:\n- Apple at (7, 0) is right below enemy\n- They'd be stupid not to take it\n- So enemy likely goes DOWN\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (7, 0):\n- I go DOWN to (9, 0) - safe, get apple\n- Next turn, I need to go LEFT to (8, 0)\n- Enemy might go to (6, 0) or (8, 0) next turn\n\nHmm, if enemy goes to (8, 0) next turn after getting (7, 0), we'd collide if I also go there.\n\nBut wait - let me see if enemy would want to go to (8, 0). From (7, 0):\n- UP to (7, 1) is their body\n- DOWN is off-board\n- LEFT to (6, 0) is safe\n- RIGHT to (8, 0) would potentially collide with me\n\nThey might predict I'm going for the corner apple and try to trap/collide with me. But they're ahead in score, so a mutual death benefits them!\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Current scores: Me 3, Enemy 4.\nIf I get apple at (9, 0): Me 4, Enemy 4 (if they get 7,0)\nThen if we both die at (8, 0): It's a draw since both have 4 apples.\n\nActually that's not terrible. But I'd rather win.\n\nLet me think about going LEFT instead:\n- Go LEFT to (8, 1) this turn\n- Enemy likely goes DOWN to (7, 0)\n- Next turn I could go DOWN to (8, 0), then work my way to other apples\n- Or I could go UP to (8, 2), etc.\n\nThis gives me more flexibility but I lose the guaranteed apple at (9, 0).\n\nHmm, but if enemy goes RIGHT to (8, 1) instead of DOWN, we'd collide and both die. Enemy has more apples so they'd win!\n\nRisk assessment:\n- DOWN: Almost guaranteed apple, slight risk of being trapped but can escape LEFT\n- LEFT: Risk of head collision if enemy surprises me, no apple this turn\n\nI think the enemy will almost certainly go for the apple at (7, 0). The apple is right there. Going RIGHT to (8, 1) gains them nothing and risks collision.\n\nI'll go DOWN to get the apple. Even if they try to trap me at (8, 0) next turn, I can assess then. Maybe they'll go LEFT to (6, 0) instead.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:**\nAfter getting (9, 0), I MUST go LEFT to (8, 0). Watch enemy - if they're at (7, 0), they might go RIGHT to (8, 0) to collide. If I think they'll do that, assess the score. If scores are tied, collision means draw. If I'm ahead, avoid collision. If behind, might as well risk it.\n\nActually, let me double-check the corner escape. After eating at (9, 0):\nMy body: Head (9,0), then (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) - 5 segments\n\nFrom (9,0), moves:\n- UP (9,1) - body - NO\n- DOWN (9,-1) - off board - NO\n- LEFT (8,0) - ONLY OPTION\n- RIGHT (10,0) - off board - NO\n\nYes, LEFT is the only option. I'm committed to that path.\n\nBut wait, what if instead of going DOWN now, I go LEFT to (8,1)?\n- Less risk of being cornered\n- Enemy likely takes (7,0)\n- I can then maneuver more freely\n\nActually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The apple at (9,0) is valuable. The enemy is unlikely to chase me to (8,0) since there are other apples to pursue. Let me just take the apple.\n\nDOWN\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLet me analyze the current situation:\n\n**My Position:** Head at (9, 1), Body at [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)]\n**Enemy Position:** Head at (7, 1), Body at [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)]\n\n**Evaluating moves from (9, 1):**\n\n1. **UP:** Would take me to (9, 2) - That's my own body! ELIMINATED.\n\n2. **DOWN:** Would take me to (9, 0) - There's an APPLE here! Collects apple.\n\n3. **LEFT:** Would take me to (8, 1) - Safe, open space.\n\n4. **RIGHT:** Would take me to (10, 1) - OFF THE BOARD! ELIMINATED.\n\n**Safe moves: DOWN or LEFT**\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- Enemy head at (7, 1) is directly above apple at (7, 0)\n- Enemy will almost certainly go DOWN to collect that apple\n- If enemy goes RIGHT to (8, 1) instead, and I go LEFT, we'd collide - they win with more apples!\n\n**Corner Escape Plan:**\nIf I go DOWN to (9, 0):\n- My body becomes: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4) after eating\n- Next turn, my ONLY option is LEFT to (8, 0) since UP is my body, DOWN/RIGHT are off-board\n- Need to watch if enemy tries to intercept at (8, 0)\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- DOWN gives guaranteed apple, manageable escape route\n- LEFT risks head collision if enemy goes RIGHT (unlikely since apple at 7,0 is more valuable)\n\n**Decision:**\nTaking the apple at (9, 0) is the right play. Enemy should logically take their apple at (7, 0). After I escape the corner via (8, 0), I can pursue (0, 6), (3, 4), or (9, 9).\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nGo LEFT to (8, 0) - it's the only escape. Watch enemy position. If they're at (7, 0) heading toward (8, 0), we might collide. At that point scores would be tied (4-4), resulting in draw if we both die.\n\nDOWN",

As I predicted last turn, I need to escape.\n\n**Evaluating moves from (9, 0):**\n\n1. **UP:** Would take me to (9, 1) - That's my own body! ELIMINATED.\n\n2. **DOWN:** Would take me to (9, -1) - OFF THE BOARD!

ELIMINATED.\n\n**Only safe move: LEFT to (8, 0)**\n\nBut wait - I need to check if enemy could be heading there too!\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy head is at (7, 0). Their possible moves:\n- UP to (7, 1) - Their own body! ELIMINATED.\n- DOWN to (7, -1) - Off board! ELIMINATED.\n- LEFT to (6, 0) - Safe\n- RIGHT to (8, 0) - This would mean we COLLIDE!\n\nSo enemy can go LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (8, 0) and I go LEFT to (8, 0), we have a HEAD COLLISION and both die!\n\nCurrent scores: Me 4, Enemy 5. If we both die, ENEMY WINS because they have more apples!\n\nBut wait... I have NO OTHER CHOICE. My only non-immediately-fatal move is LEFT. Going UP hits my body, DOWN and RIGHT are off the board.\n\nLet me double-check:\n- UP: (9, 1) - my body is there - DIE\n- DOWN: (9, -1) - off board - DIE\n- LEFT: (8, 0) - open space, but enemy might be there too - POSSIBLE COLLISION\n- RIGHT: (10, 0) - off board - DIE\n\nI literally have only one move that doesn't immediately kill me: LEFT.\n\nNow, what will the enemy do?\n- They're at (7, 0)\n- They can only go LEFT to (6, 0) or RIGHT to (8, 0)\n- Going RIGHT to (8, 0) would mean collision with me IF I go LEFT\n- But they're AHEAD in score (5 vs 4), so a mutual death means THEY WIN!\n\nThe enemy has incentive to collide with me! This is bad!\n\nHowever, from a strategic standpoint:\n- If they go RIGHT to (8, 0), we both die, they win with 5 vs 4\n- If they go LEFT to (6, 0), I escape and the game continues\n\nWhat's their likely play?\n- They might not realize I'm trapped\n- They might want to continue playing and get more apples\n- Going LEFT opens up the board for them\n- But if they're smart, they'll go RIGHT to force the winning collision\n\nI have no choice though. I MUST go LEFT. If we collide, I lose. If they go LEFT, I survive.\n\nLet me just hope they don't realize they can end the game here by going RIGHT.\n\nActually wait, let me re-read the board state more carefully:\n\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . A\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 A . . . . . . . A .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . A . . T T . T\n 3 . . . . . . . T . T\n 2 . . . . . . . T A T\n 1 . . . . . . . T . T\n 0 . . . . . . . 1 . 0\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nYes, I'm at (9, 0) - the '0' marker\nEnemy is at (7, 0) - the '1' marker\n\nMy body: T's at column 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)\nEnemy body: T's at column 7: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), plus (6, 4)\n\nSo from (9, 0):\n- UP to (9, 1) = my body = death\n- DOWN = off board = death\n- RIGHT = off board = death\n- LEFT to (8, 0) = only option\n\nFrom enemy at (7, 0):\n- UP to (7, 1) = their body = death\n- DOWN = off board = death\n- LEFT to (6, 0) = safe\n- RIGHT to (8, 0) = collision with me if I go there\n\nThe enemy might think: \"I'm ahead 5-4. If I go RIGHT and we collide, I win. Easy victory!\"\n\nOr they might think: \"Let me continue playing, there are more apples to collect.\"\n\nI have to go LEFT. It's my only move. I just have to hope they don't choose to end the game here.\n\nActually, let me think about what a rational opponent would do. They're winning 5-4. A collision gives them instant victory. Why wouldn't they take it?\n\nUnless... they don't realize I'm trapped? Or they want to maximize their score? \n\nIn competitive games, when you can guarantee a win, you should take it. So a smart opponent goes RIGHT.\n\nBut I literally have no other option. I must go LEFT and hope for the best.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn (if I survive):**\nIf I'm at (8, 0), my next priorities:\n- Apple at (8, 2) is very close - 2 moves up\n- Apple at (8, 6) is on the same column\n- Avoid enemy if they're at (6, 0) and heading my way\n- Keep escape routes open\n\nLet me plan:\nFrom (8, 0), I can go:\n- UP to (8, 1) - toward apple at (8, 2)\n- LEFT to (7, 0) - but enemy might be moving from there\n- DOWN and RIGHT are off board\n\nSo if I survive this turn, I should go UP next turn toward the apple at (8, 2).\n\nBut first, I need to survive this turn. Going LEFT.\n\nLEFT\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\n**My Position:** Head at (9, 0) in the corner\n**My Body:** (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)\n**Enemy Position:** Head at (7, 0), Body along column 7\n\n**Evaluating moves from (9, 0):**\n\n1. **UP:** Would take me to (9, 1) - That's my own body! ELIMINATED.\n2. **DOWN:** Would take me to (9, -1) - OFF THE BOARD! ELIMINATED.\n3. **LEFT:** Would take me to (8, 0) - Open space.\n4. **RIGHT:** Would take me to (10, 0) - OFF THE BOARD! ELIMINATED.\n\n**I have only ONE viable move: LEFT**\n\n**Critical Risk Assessment:**\nEnemy at (7, 0) can only go:\n- LEFT to (6, 0) - safe for them\n- RIGHT to (8, 0) - HEAD COLLISION with me!\n\nThe enemy is ahead 5-4 in apples. If we collide at (8, 0), they win instantly. A smart opponent would recognize this opportunity and go RIGHT.\n\nHowever, I have no alternative. Going UP, DOWN, or RIGHT all result in immediate death. LEFT is my only chance to survive.\n\n**Strategy for next turn (if I survive):**\n- From (8, 0), go UP toward (8, 1), then (8, 2) for the apple\n- Apple at (8, 2) is only 2 moves away\n- Apple at (8, 6) is also on the same column\n- Stay alert for enemy movements\n\nI must take the risk and hope the enemy chooses to continue playing rather than forcing the collision.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy went LEFT to (6, 0) instead of going RIGHT to collide with me.\n\n**Apple Locations:**\n- (0, 6) - far left\n- (3, 4) - middle area\n- (9, 9) - top right corner\n- (8, 2) - very close, just 2 up from me!\n- (8, 6) - same column, higher up\n\n**Current Scores:**\n- Me: 4 apples\n- Enemy: 5 apples\n\n**Evaluating moves from (8, 0):**\n\n1. **UP:** Would take me to (8, 1) - Let me check... This is open space! Moving toward apple at (8, 2). SAFE.\n\n2. **DOWN:** Would take me to (8, -1) - OFF THE BOARD! ELIMINATED.\n\n3. **LEFT:** Would take me to (7, 0) - That's enemy body! ELIMINATED.\n\n4. **RIGHT:** Would take me to (9, 0) - That's my own body! ELIMINATED.\n\nSo I have only one viable move again: UP to (8, 1).\n\nLet me verify by looking at the board:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . A\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 A . . . . . . . A .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . A . . . T . .\n 3 . . . . . . . T . T\n 2 . . . . . . . T A T\n 1 . . . . . . . T . T\n 0 . . . . . . 1 T 0 T\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nLooking at this:\n- '0' = my head at (8, 0)\n- '1' = enemy head at (6, 0)\n- 'T' at (7, 0) = enemy body\n- 'T' at (9, 0) = my body\n- 'T' at (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4) = enemy body\n- 'T' at (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3) = my body\n- 'A' at (8, 2) = apple!\n\nFrom (8, 0):\n- UP to (8, 1) = SAFE, open space\n- DOWN = off board\n- LEFT to (7, 0) = enemy body = DEATH\n- RIGHT to (9, 0) = my body = DEATH\n\nOnly option is UP!\n\n**What about the enemy?**\nEnemy head at (6, 0):\n- UP to (6, 1) - open\n- DOWN = off board\n- LEFT to (5, 0) - open\n- RIGHT to (7, 0) - their own body!\n\nSo enemy can go UP or LEFT. No collision risk with me this turn since I'm going to (8, 1) and they can only reach (6, 1) or (5, 0).\n\n**Strategy:**\nAfter going UP to (8, 1), next turn I can:\n- Continue UP to (8, 2) and get the apple!\n- My tail will move, so (9, 3) becomes free\n\nThis is great! Two turns and I get an apple at (8, 2). Then I can head toward (8, 6) or other apples.\n\nAfter getting the apple at (8, 2), I'll be at 5 apples, tying with the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: UP to (8, 1)\n2. Next turn: UP to (8, 2) - get apple! (Score: 5)\n3. Then continue UP toward (8, 6) or pivot toward other apples\n4. Apple at (9, 9) is also reachable from the right side\n5. Watch enemy movements - they might head toward (3, 4) or (0, 6)\n\nGoing UP!\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\n**My Position:** Head at (8, 0), Body at [(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)]\n**Enemy Position:** Head at (6, 0), Body along column 7\n\nI survived last turn! The enemy went LEFT instead of forcing the collision.\n\n**Evaluating moves from (8, 0):**\n\n1. **UP:** Would take me to (8, 1) - Open space! Moves toward apple at (8, 2). SAFE.\n\n2. **DOWN:** Would take me to (8, -1) - OFF THE BOARD! ELIMINATED.\n\n3. **LEFT:** Would take me to (7, 0) - That's enemy body! ELIMINATED.\n\n4. **RIGHT:** Would take me to (9, 0) - That's my own body! ELIMINATED.\n\n**Only viable move: UP**\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy at (6, 0) can go UP to (6, 1) or LEFT to (5, 0). No collision risk with my path to (8, 1).\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\n- This turn: UP to (8, 1)\n- Next turn: UP to (8, 2) to grab the apple! (Ties score at 5-5)\n- Then continue up toward apple at (8, 6)\n- Apple at (9, 9) also reachable from this corridor\n- Keep monitoring enemy - they'll likely head toward (3, 4) or (0, 6)\n\nThis path sets me up beautifully to collect the apple at (8, 2) in just one more turn, then I can continue up the right side for (8, 6) and potentially (9, 9). The right corridor is mine now!\n\nUP",

ELIMINATED.\n\n**Only viable move: UP to (8, 3)**\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- Moving to (8, 3) positions me perfectly to grab the apple at (9, 3) next turn!\n- From (8, 3) next turn, I can go RIGHT to (9, 3) for the apple\n- The enemy at (5, 1) is likely heading toward (3, 4) apple - they're far from my path\n- I'm controlling the right corridor well\n\n**Future Plan:**\n1. This turn: UP to (8, 3)\n2. Next turn: RIGHT to (9, 3) - get apple! (Score: 6-5)\n3. Then continue UP toward (8, 6) and eventually (9, 9)\n4. I have a great pipeline of apples on the right side: (9, 3) \u2192 (8, 6) \u2192 (9, 9)\n\nThe enemy is moving away toward the middle/left apples. I'll dominate the right side of the board!\n\nUP",

SAFE!\n\n2. **DOWN:** Would take me to (8, 2) - That's my own body! ELIMINATED.\n\n3. **LEFT:** Would take me to (7, 3) - Let me check... Looking at the board, (7, 3) should be empty (no T or snake there). SAFE!\n\n4. **RIGHT:** Would take me to (9, 3) - That's an APPLE! Let me verify... yes 'A' at (9, 3). SAFE and gets an apple!\n\nSo I have three viable moves: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nRIGHT to (9, 3) - This gets me an apple! Score becomes 6-5.\n\nLet me check what happens after grabbing the apple at (9, 3):\n- From (9, 3), I can go:\n  - UP to (9, 4) - should be open\n  - DOWN to (9, 2) - that would be my body (from my tail extending)\n  - LEFT to (8, 3) - that would be my body\n  - RIGHT - off the board! Can't go there.\n\nHmm, after grabbing the apple at (9, 3), I'll have limited options. But UP to (9, 4) should be open, and then I can continue UP along the right edge toward (9, 9) apple or LEFT toward (8, 6) apple.\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy head at (4, 1):\n- UP to (4, 2) - open\n- DOWN to (4, 0) - open\n- LEFT to (3, 1) - open\n- RIGHT to (5, 1) - that's their own body!\n\nEnemy is likely heading toward (3, 4) apple. They're far from me, no collision risk.\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\n- RIGHT gets me an apple NOW (6-5 lead)\n- After that, I go UP along the right edge\n- I can then target (8, 6) and (9, 9) apples\n- The enemy is on the left side of the board\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT to (9, 3) for the apple! This gives me a lead and I can then navigate UP the right edge.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (9, 3) - get apple! (Score: 6-5)\n2. Next turn: UP to (9, 4)\n3. Continue UP toward (9, 5), (9, 6)...\n4. Eventually reach (9, 9) apple or cut left to (8, 6)\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLet me analyze the current situation:\n\n**My Position:** Head at (8, 3), Body at [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1)]\n**Enemy Position:** Head at (4, 1), Body at [(5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1)]\n\n**Evaluating moves from (8, 3):**\n\n1. **UP:** Would take me to (8, 4) - Empty space. SAFE!\n\n2. **DOWN:** Would take me to (8, 2) - That's my own body! ELIMINATED.\n\n3. **LEFT:** Would take me to (7, 3) - Empty space. SAFE!\n\n4. **RIGHT:** Would take me to (9, 3) - APPLE! SAFE and scores!\n\n**Clear choice: RIGHT to get the apple at (9, 3)!**\n\nThis puts me at 6-5, giving me the lead. After grabbing this apple:\n- From (9, 3), I'll go UP to (9, 4) next turn\n- Then continue UP along the right edge toward (8, 6) and (9, 9) apples\n- The enemy at (4, 1) is far away on the left side, likely heading toward (3, 4)\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (9, 3) - get apple! (Score: 6-5)\n2. Next turn: UP to (9, 4) - keep moving up the right edge\n3. Continue toward (8, 6) apple - can approach from (9, 6) going LEFT\n4. Eventually target (9, 9) corner apple\n\nThe enemy is on the opposite side of the board, so I have the right corridor to myself. Taking this apple secures my lead!\n\nRIGHT",
