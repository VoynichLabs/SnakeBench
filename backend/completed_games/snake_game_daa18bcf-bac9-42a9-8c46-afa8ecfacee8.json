Body is empty (length 1).\n- Apples are at: (3, 9), (2, 0), (3, 8), (4, 9), (3, 3).\n- Board size 10x10.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nMy snake is very short (length 1), so backward moves are safe regarding self-collision, though for a length 1 snake, moving backward would move the head to (7,1) or (6,2) or (8,2) and the old head position (7,2) would become the tail, so moving backward is always safe unless the game logic dictates a 1-length snake cannot move backward (which it doesn't, as moving backward means the head moves to the cell immediately behind it, and since the body is empty, this cell is empty). However, since I have no body, the only self-collision I need to worry about is moving off the board boundaries. The primary goal is to approach the nearest apple while considering the enemy's position.\nThe closest apple seems to be (3, 3). It is 4 steps away (Manhattan distance).\n\n**Analyzing potential moves for Snake 0 (Head at (7, 2)):**\n\n1.  **UP (to (7, 3))**:\n    *   Safe from board boundaries: Yes (7, 3) is on the board.\n    *   Safe from self-collision: Yes (length 1).\n    *   Enemy head (5, 0) movement:\n        *   If Enemy moves UP: (5, 1). No collision.\n        *   If Enemy moves DOWN: (5, -1) -> Die (Off board).\n        *   If Enemy moves LEFT: (4, 0). No collision.\n        *   If Enemy moves RIGHT: (6, 0). No collision.\n    *   Future position: Closer to (3, 3) is (7, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3). This is a path towards the apple at (3, 3).\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (7, 1))**:\n    *   Safe from board boundaries: Yes (7, 1) is on the board.\n    *   Safe from self-collision: Yes (length 1).\n    *   Enemy collision: Similar analysis as UP, no immediate collision based on enemy possibilities.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (6, 2))**:\n    *   Safe from board boundaries: Yes (6, 2) is on the board.\n    *   Safe from self-collision: Yes (length 1).\n    *   Enemy collision: Similar analysis as UP, no immediate collision based on enemy possibilities. This moves towards (3, 3) slightly faster (2 steps away horizontally).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (8, 2))**:\n    *   Safe from board boundaries: Yes (8, 2) is on the board.\n    *   Safe from self-collision: Yes (length 1).\n    *   Enemy collision: Similar analysis as UP, no immediate collision based on enemy possibilities. Moves away from (3, 3).\n\n**Comparing safe moves:**\nApples nearby: (3, 3) is the closest reachable target.\nCurrent distance to (3, 3) from (7, 2): $|7-3| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n*   UP to (7, 3): Distance becomes 4.\n*   DOWN to (7, 1): Distance becomes 6.\n*   LEFT to (6, 2): Distance becomes 4.\n*   RIGHT to (8, 2): Distance becomes 6.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT reduce the distance to the target apple (3, 3). LEFT moves us horizontally towards x=3, which is a larger gap to close (4 units) than the vertical gap (1 unit). It seems generally better to reduce the greater distance first, or focus on a direct path. (6, 2) puts me on the path $6 \\to 5 \\to 4 \\to 3$ (X-axis) and $2 \\to 3$ (Y-axis). (7, 3) puts me on the path $7$ (X-axis) and $3 \\to 4 \\to 3$ (Y-axis) or $3 \\to 2 \\to 3$.\n\nLet's trace the path towards (3, 3) via LEFT:\n(7, 2) -> (6, 2) [Dist 4] -> (5, 2) [Dist 3] -> (4, 2) [Dist 2] -> (3, 2) [Dist 1] -> (3, 3) [Eat]. This takes 5 moves, assuming no interference.\n\nLet's trace the path towards (3, 3) via UP:\n(7, 2) -> (7, 3) [Dist 4] -> (6, 3) [Dist 3] or (7, 4) [Dist 4] depending on strategy. If we prioritize moving towards X=3: (7, 3) -> (6, 3) [Dist 3] -> (5, 3) [Dist 2] -> (4, 3) [Dist 1] -> (3, 3) [Eat]. This also takes 5 moves.\n\nSince both UP and LEFT seem equally effective for reaching (3, 3) in terms of minimum turns required, I will choose LEFT as it immediately starts closing the larger horizontal gap, bringing me closer to the center-left area where many apples are distributed ((3, 9), (2, 0), (3, 8), (3, 3), (4, 9)). Additionally, this move seems slightly less restrictive regarding the enemy snake (ID 1 at (5, 0)), as moving it further away from the X=5 column might be beneficial if it tries to move right, though this is minor.\n\nNo immediate collision threats identified for any safe move. Choosing LEFT to pursue the nearest apple (3, 3).\n\nLong-term plan: Prioritize reaching the cluster of apples around X=3 and Y=3/8/9. Keep moving towards (3, 3).\n\n**Predicted Enemy Moves & Collision Check for LEFT ((6, 2)):**\nSnake 1 (Head at (5, 0)). Target (6, 2).\nIf Snake 1 moves:\n1. UP to (5, 1). Safe.\n2. DOWN to (5, -1). Dies.\n3. LEFT to (4, 0). Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (6, 0). Safe.\n\nIf Snake 1 moves right to (6, 0), and I move left to (6, 2), there is no collision. Everything looks safe.\n\nLEFT",

Moving LEFT begins a direct, short path to that apple and keeps multiple escape options (you can continue left to the apple, or go up later to access other apples).\n- UP is reasonable for higher apples but is farther and keeps more vertical movement; however LEFT is more efficient for immediate scoring and avoids committing to the board edge too tightly (we\u2019ll still have UP available from (4,0)).\n- RIGHT doesn't get us closer to any apple and moves toward the enemy horizontally; it's less attractive.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move toward (2,0) to pick up the nearby apple. After eating, reassess and head for (3,3) or the cluster at the top depending on enemy movement. Avoid hugging walls unnecessarily; keep at least two escape options.\n\nLEFT",

Body is empty (length 1). The old head position (7, 2) is now the tail, if I had a body, but since I have length 1, my body remains empty and (7, 2) is now empty space.\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) head was at (5, 0) and moved RIGHT to (6, 0) (based on my prediction analysis, assuming the enemy chose RIGHT or UP/LEFT/DOWN didn't result in collision). Let's re-evaluate the enemy move based on the board state update.\n\nWait, the BOARD STATE provided above reflects the state *before* the move I pick for Turn 2. The previous move was LEFT, starting from (7, 2).\nMy state *after* Turn 1 move LEFT: Head (6, 2).\nEnemy state *after* Turn 1 move (assuming enemy moved to (6, 0) - see rationale): Head (6, 0).\n\nSince the board state provided is for the *start* of Turn 2, and my last move was LEFT, my new head position for Turn 2 evaluation should be (6, 2). The enemy started Turn 1 at (4, 0). If the enemy moved RIGHT it is now at (5, 0). If the enemy moved UP it is at (4, 1). If the enemy moved LEFT it is at (3, 0). If it moved DOWN it is dead.\n\nI must use the provided board state to determine where the enemy and I *are* at the start of turn 2, and then predict simultaneous moves.\n\n**Start of Turn 2 State Re-evaluation:**\n- My snake (ID 0) head: (7, 2) -> (6, 2) [After move LEFT] -> **My head for move calculation is (6, 2)**. Since my body is empty, the board position (7, 2) becomes empty.\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) head: (5, 0) [Based on reading board state: 0 . . A . 1 . . . . . -> 1 is at (5, 0)]. *Correction on reading board: The label '1' is placed at (5, 0).* **Enemy head is at (5, 0)**.\n\n*Self-Correction on Board Reading:*\n9 . . . A A . . . . .\n...\n2 . . . . . . 0 . . . (Snake 0 head at (6, 2))\n...\n0 . . A . 1 . . . . . (Apple at (2, 0), Enemy 1 head at (5, 0))\n\nOkay, the board state provided *already reflects the result of Turn 1*.\nMy previous move was LEFT, starting from (7, 2). So my head is now at (6, 2). This matches the board state showing '0' at (6, 2).\nEnemy snake 1 started Turn 1 at (4, 0). If it moved RIGHT to (5, 0), that matches the board state showing '1' at (5, 0). This suggests the enemy chose RIGHT.\n\n**Start of Turn 2 Positioning:**\n- My Head: (6, 2). Body: None. (Length 1).\n- Enemy Head: (5, 0). Body: None. (Length 1).\n- Target Apple: (3, 3) [Distance 3+1 = 4].\n\n**Analyzing Potential Moves for Snake 0 (Head at (6, 2)):**\nTarget (3, 3).\n\n1.  **UP (to (6, 3))**:\n    *   Safe from board/self: Yes.\n    *   Enemy prediction (Enemy at (5, 0)):\n        *   If Enemy moves UP to (5, 1). Safe.\n        *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 0). Safe.\n        *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (4, 0). Safe.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|6-3| + |3-3| = 3$. (Reduced by 1).\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (6, 1))**:\n    *   Safe from board/self: Yes.\n    *   Enemy prediction: Similar safety profile.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|6-3| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5$. (Increased). Not preferred.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (5, 2))**:\n    *   Safe from board/self: Yes.\n    *   Enemy prediction: Similar safety profile.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|5-3| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3$. (Reduced by 1). This puts me one step closer to the X coordinate 3.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (7, 2))**:\n    *   Safe from board/self: Yes.\n    *   Enemy prediction: Similar safety profile.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|7-3| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5$. (Increased). Not preferred.\n\n**Comparison between UP (6, 3) and LEFT (5, 2):**\nBoth moves achieve a distance of 3 to the target (3, 3).\nPath via LEFT: (6, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3). (4 moves remaining).\nPath via UP: (6, 2) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 3) OR (7, 3) -> ...\n\nSince the target X coordinate (3) requires moving 3 steps left, and the target Y coordinate (3) requires moving 1 step up, moving LEFT (to (5, 2)) seems more directly aligned with reducing the largest remaining gap (X distance remains 2, Y distance remains 1). UP moves me to (6, 3), leaving X distance 3, Y distance 0. Moving sideways (LEFT) seems superior for systematic progress towards the X=3 line where 4/5 apples reside or are near.\n\n**Enemy Consideration:**\nEnemy is at (5, 0). If the enemy tries to move toward the top apples (3, 8) or (3, 9), or towards the bottom apple (2, 0).\nEnemy (5, 0) could move UP to (5, 1). If I move LEFT to (5, 2), we remain safe.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 0), and I move LEFT to (5, 2), we are safe.\n\nThere are no immediate threats to collision safety. I continue the strategy towards (3, 3) by moving LEFT.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nContinue moving towards the clustered apples around X=3. Prioritize reducing the X distance to 3. Avoid any moves that increase Manhattan distance to (3, 3) unless forced by safety, which is not the case here. LEFT moves to (5, 2), reducing Manhattan distance by 1 (from 4 to 3).\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

Body is empty (length 1).\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) head is at (5, 0) (As deduced from the board state showing '1' at (5, 0)).\n\n**Start of Turn 3 Positioning:**\n- My Head: (5, 2). Body: None. (Length 1).\n- Enemy Head: (5, 0). Body: None. (Length 1).\n- Target Apple: (3, 3) [Distance 2+1 = 3]. Another good target is (3, 8) or (3, 9), but (3, 3) is closest.\n\n**Analyzing Potential Moves for Snake 0 (Head at (5, 2)):**\n\n1.  **UP (to (5, 3))**:\n    *   Safe from board/self: Yes.\n    *   Enemy prediction (Enemy at (5, 0)): Head-on collision if Enemy moves UP to (5, 1)? No collision. If Enemy moves UP to (5, 1) and I move UP to (5, 3), we are safe. If Enemy moves UP to (5, 1) and I move DOWN to (5, 1), collision! (Enemy head replaces my body/head position, but since bodies are empty, standard collision rules apply). Collision risk exists if Enemy moves UP and I move DOWN, or vice versa, if we target the same intermediate square, but here we target squares separated by 2.\n    *   Collision check: If Enemy moves UP to (5, 1), and I move UP to (5, 3), safe.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|5-3| + |3-3| = 2$. (Reduced by 1). Best move so far.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (5, 1))**:\n    *   Safe from board/self: Yes.\n    *   Enemy prediction: If Enemy moves UP to (5, 1), **COLLISION! Both snakes die.** This move is extremely risky if the enemy also tries to move towards the center. Since the enemy is at (5, 0) and the closest cluster of apples is near X=3/Y=8/9, moving UP to (5, 3) seems more logical for the enemy than moving towards me at (5, 1) unless they are trying to cut me off or move towards the apple at (2, 0). Given the high density of important apples in the top half (Y=8, 9), it's unlikely the enemy would commit to moving towards (5, 1) immediately. However, moving to (5, 1) seems to move farther away from the bulk of the treasure.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|5-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4$. (Increased). Not preferred.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (4, 2))**:\n    *   Safe from board/self: Yes.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|4-3| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2$. (Reduced by 1). Tied with UP for Manhattan distance reduction.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (6, 2))**:\n    *   Safe from board/self: Yes.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|6-3| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4$. (Increased). Not preferred.\n\n**Comparison between UP ((5, 3)) and LEFT ((4, 2)):**\nBoth reduce Manhattan distance to (3, 3) to 2.\nMove UP: Future path likely to (5, 4) or (4, 3) / (6, 3). Directly benefits reaching apples near X=3, Y=3 and above.\nMove LEFT: Future path likely to (4, 3) or (3, 2) / (3, 4). Directly benefits reaching X=3 sooner.\n\nSince the majority of apples (4/5) are at X=3 or X=4, prioritizing movement towards X=3 seems slightly better. Moving LEFT takes me from X=5 to X=4, a net reduction of 1, while Y changes from 2 to 2. Moving UP takes me from Y=2 to Y=3, a net reduction of 1, while X changes from 5 to 5. Reaching X=3 sooner seems critical given the distribution.\n\nLet's confirm enemy threat for LEFT: Enemy at (5, 0). If Enemy moves UP to (5, 1). I move LEFT to (4, 2). Completely safe.\n\nLet's confirm enemy threat for UP: Enemy at (5, 0). If Enemy moves UP to (5, 1). I move UP to (5, 3). Completely safe.\n\nI choose LEFT as it makes concrete progress towards the X-coordinate 3, which hosts the nearest apple (3, 3) and is crucial for reaching the top cluster.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue moving generally towards X=3. If safe, follow path: (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) (Eat Apple 1) or (4, 3) -> (3, 3).\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

Let's re-examine the board visualization relative to the previous move description.)\n\n**Reconciling Board State and Last Move:**\nLast Move Rationale stated: Move LEFT from (5, 2) to (4, 2).\nYour snake (ID 0) status in the current turn header shows: Head: (4, 2), Body: none. **This confirms the move LEFT was successful and executed.**\nEnemy snake (ID 1) status in the current turn header shows: Head: (3, 1), Body: none. **This contradicts the previous turn's board state visualization showing '1' at (5, 0).** This means Snake #1 moved from (5, 0) to (3, 1) or some other path that resulted in (3, 1) this turn. We must use the *current* state provided in the header.\n\n**Current State (Turn 4):**\n*   My Head ($S_0$): (4, 2). Body: None. Length 1.\n*   Enemy Head ($S_1$): (3, 1). Body: None. Length 1.\n*   Apples: (3, 9), (2, 0), (3, 8), (4, 9), (3, 3).\n\n**Target Apple:** (3, 3) is the closest. $D((4, 2), (3, 3)) = |4-3| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Analyzing Potential Moves for Snake 0 (Head at (4, 2)):**\n\nSnake 1 is quite close at (3, 1). We need to move towards (3, 3) while being aware of $S_1$.\n\n1.  **UP (to (4, 3))**:\n    *   Safe from self: Yes.\n    *   Collision check with $S_1$ at (3, 1): Safe.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|4-3| + |3-3| = 1$. (Best reduction).\n    *   Enemy Movement Prediction: $S_1$ is at (3, 1). If $S_1$ moves UP to (3, 2), it heads straight for me at (4, 3) next turn, or it approaches (3, 3) faster. If $S_1$ moves LEFT to (2, 1), it targets (2, 0). If $S_1$ moves RIGHT to (4, 1). A move to (4, 3) seems safe this turn.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (4, 1))**:\n    *   Safe from self: Yes.\n    *   Collision check with $S_1$ at (3, 1): If $S_1$ moves RIGHT to (4, 1), **COLLISION!** This is a major risk.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|4-3| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3$. (Worse).\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (3, 2))**:\n    *   Safe from self: Yes.\n    *   Collision check with $S_1$ at (3, 1): If $S_1$ moves UP to (3, 2), **COLLISION!** This is a major risk.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|3-3| + |2-3| = 1$. (Best reduction).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (5, 2))**:\n    *   Safe from self: Yes.\n    *   Collision check with $S_1$ at (3, 1): Safe.\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): $|5-3| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3$. (Worse).\n\n**Comparing UP ((4, 3)) and LEFT ((3, 2)):**\nBoth achieve the best possible distance reduction to the target (3, 3) in 1 step (Distance = 1).\n\n*   Move UP to (4, 3):\n    *   Threat Analysis: $S_1$ (at (3, 1)) moving UP to (3, 2) results in me at (4, 3) and $S_1$ at (3, 2). Safe. $S_1$ moving LEFT to (2, 1). Safe. $S_1$ moving RIGHT to (4, 1). Safe. $S_1$ moving DOWN to (3, 0). Safe. UP seems very safe regarding simultaneous moves, and places me one step away from (3, 3).\n\n*   Move LEFT to (3, 2):\n    *   Threat Analysis: $S_1$ has a direct path to (3, 2) by moving UP. If $S_1$ moves UP to (3, 2), we both die. This is too risky when an equally good, safe move exists.\n\nTherefore, UP is the preferred move as it progresses towards the closest apple while completely avoiding a potential head-on collision with the actively maneuvering opponent.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Focus on securing apple (3, 3) immediately. After that, the cluster at (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9) becomes the next priority. Snake 1 is currently close to the bottom apple (2, 0). I need to establish control over the center/top region.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move UP to (4, 3) this turn. Next turn, aim for RIGHT to (5, 3) or LEFT to (3, 3). If (3, 3) is available, take it. If $S_1$ moves towards (3, 3) or me, re-evaluate, prioritizing self-preservation.\nUP",

Snake 1 is now at (3, 2).\n\n**Analyzing Potential Moves for Snake 0 (Head at (4, 3)):**\n\n1.  **LEFT (to (3, 3))**:\n    *   This moves directly onto apple (3, 3) and increases my length to 2.\n    *   Safety: Collision check with $S_1$ at (3, 2). If $S_1$ moves UP to (3, 3), it's a head-on collision, resulting in both deaths. If $S_1$ moves RIGHT to (4, 2), it's safe for me. If $S_1$ moves DOWN to (3, 1), it's safe for me. If $S_1$ moves LEFT to (2, 2), it's safe for me.\n    *   Probability analysis: $S_1$ is very close to the apple at (2, 0), but also close to me. Since $S_1$ is currently at (3, 2) and I am moving to (3, 3), $S_1$ has a 25% chance of colliding if it moves up. However, eating the apple is a massive benefit.\n\n2.  **UP (to (4, 4))**:\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): 2.\n    *   Safety: If $S_1$ moves UP to (3, 3), it eats the apple and I move to (4, 4). Safe for me. $S_1$ likely wants this apple.\n\n3.  **RIGHT (to (5, 3))**:\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): 3.\n    *   Safety: If $S_1$ moves LEFT to (2, 2) or DOWN to (3, 1), I am safe. If $S_1$ moves UP to (3, 4), I am safe. If $S_1$ moves RIGHT to (4, 3), it causes a head-on collision with my current position (4, 3) -> (5, 3) vs (3, 2) -> (4, 3). Collision! Risk of death if $S_1$ moves RIGHT.\n\n4.  **DOWN (to (4, 2))**:\n    *   Distance to (3, 3): 2.\n    *   Safety: If $S_1$ moves UP to (3, 3), it eats the apple and I move to (4, 2). Safe for me. If $S_1$ moves RIGHT to (4, 2), **COLLISION!**\n\n**Decision: Risking the Collision for the Apple**\nMove LEFT to (3, 3) secures the first apple immediately. While there is a 25% risk of collision if $S_1$ also moves UP to (3, 3), the reward of successfully eating (3, 3) seems worth the calculated risk, especially since $S_1$ might prioritize one of the other apples or move away. If $S_1$ moves in any direction other than UP, I clearly win the interaction and gain the apple/length.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, $S_1$ might choose to move UP to (3, 3) and steal the apple, moving me further away from the immediate goal.\n\nGiven the immediate proximity, LEFT is the aggressive, highest-yield move this turn.\n\nIf $S_1$ moves UP to (3, 3) and I move LEFT to (3, 3), we both die.\nIf $S_1$ moves any other direction (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), I eat the apple and gain length.\n\nComparing risks:\n*   Taking LEFT: 25% chance of instant mutual death, 75% chance of gaining an apple and length.\n*   Taking UP/DOWN: High chance $S_1$ secures the apple, resulting in S0 losing initiative.\n\nI will commit to eating the apple.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Secure (3, 3). After this, I will be L=2 at (3, 3). My next target will be (3, 8) or (3, 9). I need to navigate towards the cluster of apples in the top-left quadrant while ensuring the new body segment doesn't immediately restrict my movement. Since L=1 currently, movement is completely unrestricted even after eating.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

(Prob 25%)\n* If S1 moves DOWN/LEFT: I eat the apple safely. (Prob 50%)\nNet result for LEFT: 75% chance of S0 survival + apple, 25% chance of mutual death. This is still the highest immediate reward move.\n\nMy move 'RIGHT' leads to (5, 3). S1 starts at (3, 2).\n* If S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 3): S1 hits my *current* square (4, 3). S1 dies. S0 moves to (5, 3). S0 is safe. (Prob 25%)\n* If S1 moves UP/DOWN/LEFT: S1 might eat the apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I willingly give up the apple control to S1 if S1 moves away from (4, 3). If S1 moves toward (4, 3), S1 dies, and I miss the apple. S0 must prioritize eating the apple at (3, 3).\n\nI will stick to the decision from Turn 5: LEFT to take control of the apple.\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**Analysis of Current State (Turn 6):**\nThe initial high-risk/high-reward move paid off. Snake 0 successfully moved to (3, 3) and ate the apple (3, 3). Snake #1, which had been at (3, 2), must have moved to (3, 3) or (4, 3) or another square.\n\nLet's decode what happened based on the board state:\nS0 Head is (3, 3). S0 ate the apple, so length increased from 1 to 2. New body: [(4, 3), (3, 3)]. The state provided shows: Head (3, 3), Body [(4, 3)], Apples 1. This implies the move was LEFT (4,3) -> (3,3), and the growth was successful, meaning (3, 3) was an apple, and the old head position (4, 3) is now the new first body segment. Wait, standard convention: head is first, tail is last. If length was 1 [(H)], and eats, new length is 2 [(H'), B1]. If H=(4,3) moves LEFT to H'=(3,3), then B1 should be (4,3). The provided body list is [(4, 3)]. This seems consistent with S0 eating the apple at (3, 3) and being L=2.\n\nSnake 1's starting position was (3, 2).\nIf S1 moved UP to (3, 3) $\\rightarrow$ Collision, both die. (This didn't happen as S0 is alive).\nIf S1 moved RIGHT to (4, 3) $\\rightarrow$ S1 died hitting S0's previous position. S0 ate the apple. S1's score remains 1, but it should be dead.\nIf S1 moved DOWN/LEFT $\\rightarrow$ S0 ate the apple safely.\n\nSince S1 is listed as alive with Head (2, 0) and Body [(3, 0)], this means S1 *did not* attempt to move onto (3, 3) or (4, 3). S1 must have moved in a safe direction relative to S0's planned move (LEFT to (3, 3)).\n\nS0 moved LEFT (To 3,3) and ate the apple. S0 is now L=2. Body: [(3, 3), (4, 3)].\nS1 started at (3, 2). For S1 to end at (2, 0) (with body at (3, 0)), S1 must have moved LEFT twice, or some combination. A single move from (3, 2) results in (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), or (3, 1).\n\n**Crucial Deduction:** The board state provided for T=6 *must* reflect the outcome of simultaneous moves from T=5.\nS0 moved LEFT from (4, 3) to (3, 3) and ate the apple at (3, 3).\nS1 moved from (3, 2) to (2, 0) in one turn. This is impossible. A snake cannot jump from (3, 2) to (2, 0) in one step.\n\n**Conclusion on provided state:** The state provided for Turn 6 implies that the initial game state in T=5 *was not* used to calculate the move, or the provided T=5 rationale describing the board state was based on a hypothetical start state that differs from the game engine's actual history.\n\nI must proceed based on the **current state given for T=6**:\nS0 Head: (3, 3). Body: [(4, 3)]. L=2.\nS1 Head: (2, 0). Body: [(3, 0)]. L=2.\nApples: (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 9), (0, 8), (6, 2).\n\nThis means S0 successfully ate an apple (apple count 1), and S1 successfully moved from (3, 2) to (2, 0) in one turn, which is impossible for a standard one-step move (unless S1 teleported or the game history is misleading). Assuming the current board state is the **ground truth for planning the next move**:\n\nS0 is at (3, 3). S1 is at (2, 0).\nS0's body segments are (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (tail is gone since L=2 implies two segments, (3,3) head, (4,3) body. If it ate, it should be L=2. If S0 ate (3,3), the body should be [(3,3), (4,3)]. Let's trust the provided structure: Head (3,3), Body [(4, 3)]. If S0 previously had L=1 [(4,3)], and ate (3,3), the new body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. The provided body structure means S0 is L=2, and if it $didn't$ eat, the tail would have fallen off, leaving L=1. Since apple count increased to 1, it means S0 ate an apple. If S0 was L=1 before, and ate, it is L=2, and the body list should have one segment: the old head position.\n\nLet's assume the board structure means S0 successfully ate the apple at (3, 3) and is now L=2, residing at (3, 3) with the preceding segment at (4, 3). This means the tail fell off from the previous segment at (4, 3), which is a normal growth pattern if the snake was L>1 before, but since S0 was L=1, the old head (4, 3) must now be the body segment, and the tail should have fallen off *if* S0 wasn't growing. Since S0 grew, the tail stays put, and the previous head (4, 3) becomes B1. This requires S0 to have been L=2 previously, which it wasn't.\n\n**Adhering strictly to the board state provided for T=6:**\nS0: Head (3, 3). Body: [(4, 3)]. Length = 2. (If L=2, it must have 1 body segment if it just grew, or 2 segments if it was L=3 before and the tail dropped). Since apples increased from 0 to 1, S0 grew. A snake growing from L=1 to L=2 should have Body=[(Old Head)]. Old Head was (4, 3). So Body=[(4, 3)]. This is consistent with L=2 and has just eaten.\n\nS1: Head (2, 0). Body: [(3, 0)]. Length = 2. Apples = 1.\n\n**Goal Selection:**\nThe closest apples are (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (0, 8) (all far up). Nearest low apple is (6, 2). The area around S0 (3, 3) is now clear. S1 is far away at (2, 0).\n\nS0 should head towards the highest cluster of apples: (3, 9), (4, 9), (3, 8), (0, 8).\n\nTarget: (3, 8) or (3, 9). They require moving UP multiple times.\n\nS0 Position: (3, 3). Target (3, 9). Distance = 6 steps UP.\n\n**Move Analysis (Head at (3, 3)):**\n\n1.  **UP (to (3, 4))**: Good progress towards the top cluster.\n    *   Safety: S1 is at (2, 0). S1 is unlikely to reach S0 quickly. S1 likely moves UP towards (2, 1) or similar. Safe move.\n\n2.  **RIGHT (to (4, 3))**: Moves into S0's previous location.\n    *   Safety: This is safe, as (4, 3) is now the body segment, but since S0 is moving into its own body segment when growing, we must check if the tail fell off. Since L=2, the tail *did* fall off from the position preceding (4, 3). If the snake was L=1 [(4, 3)], ate at (3, 3), it became L=2 [(3, 3), (4, 3)]. The segment at (4, 3) is now the tail. Moving RIGHT to (4, 3) means moving into the tail. **Collision Risk (Self-kill).** (Unless the game rules imply the segment that *was* the head when it ate becomes the new tail point, and the old tail is dropped *before* the head moves, which means (4, 3) is effectively the tail and moving into it is a collision). Standard snake: If L=2 [(H, B1)], moving results in [(H', B=H)], and the previous tail segment is dropped. Since L is now 2, there is no previous segment to drop unless L was 3. If L=2, and it eats, L=3. The board shows L=2, apples=1 (meaning it just ate). If L=1 before eating, it is now L=2. If L=[(H)], ate, then L'=[(H'), H]. If H=(4,3) moves to H'=(3,3), then L'=[(3,3), (4,3)]. Moving RIGHT to (4, 3) is hitting the tail. Must avoid.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 3))**: Moves away from the main apple cluster.\n    *   Safety: Safe, but strategically poor compared to UP.\n\n4.  **DOWN (to (3, 2))**: Moves away from the main apple cluster, towards S1's perceived previous location.\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n\n**Decision:** Move UP to start heading towards the main cluster of 4 apples in the top quadrant. The move is safe, maximizes forward progress towards high value targets, and S1 is too far to pose an immediate threat.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move steadily UP towards the (3, 8) to (4, 9) area. Avoid moving into the segment at (4, 3). Prioritize the dense cluster over the isolated apple at (6, 2).\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP",

The board state provided MUST mean the tail fell off if L=2 and it just ate, or L=1 before eating, ate, and is now L=2, but the body structure is inconsistent with standard growth if the old head position (4,3) is now B1 and the initial head (3,3) is the new head. Given the board state structure provided for T=6: Head (3, 3), Body [(4, 3)], Apple Count 1. This means L=2. If L=2, and the snake just ate, it should be L=3, unless the tail fell off immediately. Since the move history is confusing, I rely solely on the T=6 state: S0 is at (3, 3), L=2, body segment at (4, 3).\n\nLet's assume the snake grew on T=6 using the move **LEFT** from (4,3) to (3,3) eating the apple at (3,3). If S0 was L=1 [(4,3)] before, it becomes L=2 [(3,3), (4,3)]. If the board shows Body: [(4,3)], this means L=2, and the tail is at (4,3). Moving into (4,3) is death). **My decision to move UP seems safest against this ambiguity, as (3, 4) is clear space.**\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #1 - Head: (1, 0), Body: [(2, 0)], Apples: 1.

Let's trust the current description provided for T=7: S0 is L=2 (Head + 1 body segment).\n\nS1: Head (1, 0), Body [(2, 0)]. (L=2).\n\n**Current Head Positions:** S0=(3, 4), S1=(1, 0). Significant distance.\n\n**Goal:** Move to the top cluster. S0 needs to reach (3, 8) or (4, 9). Currently 4 segments away vertically from (3, 8).\n\n**Analysis of Potential Moves for Snake 0 (Head at (3, 4)):**\n\n1.  **UP (to (3, 5))**: Continues progress toward the top cluster.\n    *   Safety: (3, 5) is empty. S1 is far away at (1, 0). Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 3))**: Moves onto its own body segment [(3, 3) is the body segment listed in the description for T=7, if we assume H=(3,4), B=[(3,3)]]. **Collision Risk (Self-kill).** (If the body list [(3, 3)] means the body segment is at (3, 3), moving there is fatal).\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 4))**: Moves sideways.\n    *   Safety: Empty space. Safe, but slower progress towards the main goal.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 4))**: Moves sideways.\n    *   Safety: Empty space. Safe.\n\n**Safety Check for DOWN:** If the snake is Head (3, 4) and Body is [(3, 3)], then moving DOWN leads directly into the body segment at (3, 3). This is a self-collision. Move DOWN is forbidden.\n\n**Strategy Selection:** Given that UP is the line of greatest reward acquisition (heading to many apples), and it is safe, it is the preferred move. S1 is not a factor for several turns.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving UP consistently towards the highest concentration of apples (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9). Only deviate if a closer, isolated apple (like (6, 2)) becomes highly accessible without sacrificing trajectory, or if safety demands it.\n\nUP",

This means the snake size did not change, and the tail fell off (3, 3) -> (3, 4). *Crucially, the current body segment at (3, 4) is behind the head (3, 5).*\n\nS1 State: Head: (0, 0), Body: [(1, 0)]. This implies S1 moved LEFT into (0, 0) on Turn 6 (from (1, 0)), and its tail (2, 0) fell off.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Assuming both snakes moved UP/LEFT relative to the last move description, resulting in the listed T=7 state):**\nIf S0 moved UP on T=6: Head (3, 4) -> (3, 5). Body (3, 3) -> (3, 4).\nIf S1 moved LEFT on T=6: Head (1, 0) -> (0, 0). Body (2, 0) -> (1, 0).\n\n---\n**Determining Next Moves (Turn 7)**\n\nS0 Head: (3, 5). Body segments to avoid: (3, 4). Backwards move is to (3, 4) -> Collision.\nS1 Head: (0, 0). Distance is significant.\n\n**Potential Moves for S0 (Head at (3, 5)):**\n\n1.  **UP (to (3, 6))**: Continues upward trajectory toward the cluster (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9). Safe: (3, 6) is empty.\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 4))**: Hits own body segment. **FAIL.**\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 5))**: Sidestep. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 5))**: Sidestep. Safe.\n\n**Enemy S1 Move Prediction (T=7):**\nS1 has apples at (0, 8) and (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9) nearby. Its current head is at (0, 0).\nS1's best move is likely UP (to (0, 1)) to approach (0, 8).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (0, 1):\nS0 at (3, 5) is safe from S1.\n\n**Strategy:** Prioritize reaching the dense area of apples (Y=8, Y=9). UP achieves this most directly.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Until reaching proximity of the apples at Y=8/9 (i.e., reaching Y=7 or Y=8), stick to the UP direction unless an immediate, safer eating opportunity arises or collision is imminent. Since Up is clear, it remains the optimal choice.\n\nUP",
