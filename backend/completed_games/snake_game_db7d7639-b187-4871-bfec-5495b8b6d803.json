This puts us one cell west of the juicy apple at (1,6) and locks us onto the left\u2011edge corridor where three apples sit stacked at (1,6), (1,7) and (1,9).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f3:** If (1,6) is still there, go **UP** onto (1,6) and snag it \u2192 instant point, plus we keep the body line tight.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f4:** From (1,6) we can either continue **LEFT** toward (0,6) for any future apples or, if the board forces us, shimmy **RIGHT** back toward the center to dodge a potential head\u2011on trap later.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Rationale:**  \n- \ud83d\udc0d **Enemy?** Head at (7,8) with tail at (6,8). He\u2019s far away and has no apple directly adjacent, so no head\u2011on threat this turn.  \n- \ud83c\udf4e **Apple alert?** The cluster (1,6\u202f\u2192\u202f1,7\u202f\u2192\u202f1,9) is our golden ticket. Right now the closest apple is just one step north at (1,6).  \n- \u274c **RIGHT?** That would be moving into our own tail (3,5) \u2192 instant death. \ud83d\udeab  \n- \u2728 **UP?** (2,6) is safe but doesn\u2019t bring us any closer to the top\u2011left apples; we\u2019d still be one column to the right.  \n- \ud83d\udcc9 **DOWN?** (2,4) also safe but pushes us away from the high\u2011score zone on the bottom side.  \n- **LEFT** puts us on the direct path to the apple stack, keeps our body in a vertical line that can pivot later, and leaves the opponent nowhere near our route.  \n- \ud83d\udcca **Score gap:** We\u2019re tied at 1. Snatching the next apple gives us a lead and lets us start bullying the board while the rival lingers on the far\u2011right side.  \n- \ud83e\udd14 **Future risk?** If the opponent tries to chase the right\u2011side apples (7,2\u202f/\u202f7,4\u202f/\u202f9,5\u20118) we\u2019ll stay on the opposite flank, free to set a head\u2011on trap when our length finally exceeds theirs.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 TL;DR: Lock onto the left column, eat the next apple, and start the march toward domination.

We can *later* cut off that detour with a vertical wall at the top row, turning its left\u2011hand move into a deadly dead\u2011end.  \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **Future maneuver blueprint (next 3\u20114 turns):**  \n   - **Turn\u202f8:** **UP** \u2192 head lands at (1,\u202f9), growth triggered, score ties 5\u20115.  \n   - **Turn\u202f9:** **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,\u202f9) \u2013 top\u2011row push, no apple but we secure the \u201ctop\u2011border\u201d line, making the rival\u2019s leftward drift forced into a corner.  \n   - **Turn\u202f10:** **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,\u202f9) \u2013 continue the wall, now covering (3,\u202f9) and opening a lane to the apple at (3,\u202f8) next turn.  \n   - **Turn\u202f11:** **DOWN** \u2192 (3,\u202f8) \u2013 smash the (3,\u202f8) apple, score jumps to **6**, length to **7**, and we lock the board\u2019s north\u2011west quadrant.  \n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **Safety audit:**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (1,\u202f9) is free of any segment, within board limits, and not occupied by the enemy.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,\u202f8) is safe but sacrifices the juicy apple and risks being boxed into a dead\u2011end corner later.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,\u202f8) is safe but leaves the top\u2011row apple untouched; you\u2019ll have to waste an extra turn to get back to (1,\u202f9) later.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Final decision:** Push forward *now* to the apple, cement our top\u2011row presence, and start constructing the wall that will trap the rival. If we hold back, we let them *eat* that apple and maintain the lead; if we blunder sideways, we lose the content boost and waste a turn.  \n\nUP",

All of these are occupied, so any move back to (1,\u202f8) would *self\u2011crash* instantly.  \n- **Enemy #0 head:** (9,\u202f3). Its whole torso is a vertical wall at column\u202f9, stretching down to (9,\u202f8). The only legal moves it can make this turn are **LEFT** \u2192 (8,\u202f3) or **DOWN** \u2192 (9,\u202f2).  \n- **Apples glowing:** (3,\u202f8) is directly beneath you, (5,\u202f8) two cells to the right, and a handful of lower\u2011board apples. Our priority is to grab the *top\u2011row* apples first to grow fast and build a wall.  \n\n\u2694\ufe0f **Why LEFT feels like a coward\u2019s retreat**  \n- LEFT takes us to the dead\u2011end corner (0,\u202f9). Once you\u2019re in a corner you have *zero* flexibility to pivot if the enemy decides to snake down column\u202f9 and cut you off.  \n- LEFT wastes the **golden (3,\u202f8)** apple that sits right under the top row we\u2019re already on. You\u2019ll have to crawl all the way back toward the center just to get it, giving the rival free rein.  \n- It also doesn\u2019t add any length this turn, so you\u2019re not gaining any \u201cbrick\u201d to build a trap.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Why RIGHT is pure steel**  \n- RIGHT to (2,\u202f9) is OOB\u2011free and *clear* of any of our own segments. The head stays on the top row, preserving our vertical wall\u2011building momentum.  \n- It pushes us *one step* toward the (3,\u202f8) apple, letting us grab it on the very next turn with a simple DOWN. That single bite will give us a +1 segment and *score the tie\u2011breaker* (6\u202fvs\u202f5).  \n- After that bite, our body will be longer, turning every additional RIGHT into a *brick* that the enemy can\u2019t slip through.  \n- It leaves us with room to later swing down the column, cutting off the enemy\u2019s leftward escape routes.  \n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **Safety audit**  \n- **HEAD\u2011ON collision?** Enemy is miles away on column\u202f9; a RIGHT move can\u2019t intersect them this turn.  \n- **SELF\u2011COLLISION?** DOWN would slam into (1,\u202f8) \u2013 illegal. LEFT and RIGHT are both safe, but LEFT sacrifices growth and flexibility.  \n- **OOB?** Both LEFT and RIGHT keep y\u202f=\u202f9, still inside the 0\u20119 boundary.  \n\n\ud83d\udcc8 **Growth & wall\u2011building forecast**  \n\n| Turn | Move | Result | What we gain |\n|------|------|--------|--------------|\n| 9    | **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,\u202f9) | No apple, keep length 5 | Moves us toward central apple cluster |\n| 10   | **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,\u202f9) | No apple, keep length 5 | One more brick on the top row |\n| 11   | **DOWN** \u2192 (3,\u202f8) | *Apple!* (3,\u202f8) | Length \u2192\u202f6, score \u2192\u202f6 |\n| 12   | **LEFT** \u2192 (2,\u202f8) | Empty, no apple | Starts carving a leftward wall while the enemy is still stuck in column\u202f9 |\n| 13   | **LEFT** \u2192 (1,\u202f8) | Empty, no apple | Locks the central corridor \u2013 enemy now forced into a corner |\n| 14+  | **Downward sweep** toward the enemy\u2019s tail, using the extra segment to *squeeze* it into a head\u2011on line. |\n\n\ud83d\udca5 **The crux:** Every extra segment you grow is a brick. The sooner you grab the (3,\u202f8) apple, the quicker you can seal the box and force a deadly head\u2011on when your score leads.  \n\nSo let\u2019s lay that first brick now and keep the pressure on!\n\nRIGHT",

Its only legal moves this turn are **UP** to (8,\u202f2) (apple), **DOWN** to (8,\u202f4), or **LEFT** to (7,\u202f3).  \n- **Apples glowing:** (3,\u202f8) sits right beneath the top row we\u2019re on. Grab it now and we\u2019ll out\u2011grow the rival (6\u202fvs\u202f5).  \n\n\u2694\ufe0f **Why the other directions are dead ends**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (1,\u202f8) lands on our own body. That\u2019s a guaranteed self\u2011crash \u2192 \u274c.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1,\u202f10) goes off the board. Instant death \u2192 \u274c.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,\u202f9) is safe **only** if you love being trapped in a corner. No apple, zero growth, and you\u2019ll have to crawl back across the whole board later \u2013 a waste of precious turns.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Why RIGHT is the pure steel move**  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,\u202f9) stays on the top row, clears any of our own segments, and keeps the head at y\u202f=\u202f9.  \n- From here you can:  \n  1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f11:** *RIGHT* again \u2192 (3,\u202f9) (still no apple).  \n  2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f12:** *DOWN* \u2192 (3,\u202f8) **BOOM!** Apple consumed, length\u202f+\u202f1, score\u202f+\u202f1 (now 6).  \n  3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f13:** *LEFT* \u2192 (2,\u202f8) \u2013 start carving a leftward wall while the enemy is stuck on column\u202f9.  \n  4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f14+:** Use the extra segment to *squeeze* the rival into a head\u2011on line (they\u2019ll eventually hit the wall we\u2019re building).  \n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **Safety audit**  \n- **Head\u2011on collision?** Enemy is far on column\u202f9; RIGHT keeps us 7 columns away.  \n- **Self\u2011collision?** We\u2019re moving forward, not backward.  \n- **OOB?** Both y and x stay inside 0\u20119 range.  \n\n\ud83d\udcc8 **Growth & wall\u2011building forecast**  \n\n| Turn | Move | Result | What we gain |\n|------|------|--------|--------------|\n| 10   | **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,\u202f9) | No apple, keep length\u202f5 | Positions us to capture (3,\u202f8) next turn |\n| 11   | RIGHT \u2192 (3,\u202f9) | No apple, keep length\u202f5 | Two bricks on top row |\n| 12   | DOWN \u2192 (3,\u202f8) | Apple! length\u202f6, score\u202f6 | First bite of our planned box |\n| 13   | LEFT \u2192 (2,\u202f8) | Empty, no apple | Begins leftward wall while enemy stuck |\n| 14   | LEFT \u2192 (1,\u202f8) | Empty, no apple | Locks the central corridor |\n| 15+  | Downward sweep toward (8,\u202f2) tail | Use extra segment to force head\u2011on | Victory in sight |\n\n\ud83d\udca5 **The crux:** Every extra segment you grow is a brick. The sooner you grab (3,\u202f8), the quicker you can seal the box and turn the tide.

Growing to 6 sets the pressure dial.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 After eating, *turn south* \u2192 **(3,7)** to stretch down the center column. This keeps us away from the enemy\u2019s vertical wall at x=9 and opens a clear *south\u2011east* path.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Use our new extra segment to *press westward* at **(2,7)** while the rival is stuck on the right edge. The extra body gives us a \u201cbrick\u201d that can later seal a gap and force a head\u2011on collision when we out\u2011grow them.  \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep eyes on **(5,8)** \u2013 a juicy apple that we\u2019ll line up to snag with a quick *right \u2192 down* combo after we\u2019ve built a leftward wall.

Both keep me away from the right wall and avoid trapping myself against my own tail.\n\n3. **Box the rival later.**  \n   After snatching the bottom apples I can swing left across the middle rows, cutting off the opponent\u2019s retreat corridor along the left wall. With a score advantage I can force a head\u2011on collision later.\n\n**\u2705 Best move this turn:** **DOWN** \u2013 safe, opens the fastest apple path, and preserves flexibility for the longer\u2011term box.\n\nDOWN",

The only LEGAL moves are **UP** (to an empty spot on the top row) and **RIGHT** (to the untouched cell **(6,\u202f8)**). Both avoid self\u2011collision and board edge, but **RIGHT** opens the quickest path to a *future apple* and preserves **two** safe follow\u2011ups (UP\u202f+\u202fRIGHT).  \n\n- **WHY RIGHT NOW?**  \n  \ud83c\udfaf\u202f*Score push*: No immediate apple, but if we keep the \u201cright\u2011track\u201d we can **eat the apple at (7,\u202f7)** on the next turn.

Going right would smash into its own body at (2,0) and down would be off the board. So we\u2019ve forced them into a vertical crawl. \ud83c\udfa4  \n\n\ud83e\udded **LONG\u2011TERM MAP:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Hard\u2011Left Surge** \u2013 keep rolling left until we hit the leftmost wall (x\u202f=\u202f0). This secures a solid stretch of cells from (0,9) to (8,9), a perfect foundation for future vertical expansion.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Vertical Blockade** \u2013 after we sit at (0,9) (or (1,9) if we want a little breathing room), we\u2019ll plunge down the leftmost column, locking the path that #0 is forced to use.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Apple Grab at (8,6)** \u2013 the moment column\u202f8 is clear, we\u2019ll descend from the top and feast on that apple. That extra segment gives us length, closes the gap, and creates a deadly head\u2011on KO zone if #0 ever steps into the same cell. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Head\u2011On Ambush** \u2013 with a longer snake we can position ourselves opposite #0\u2019s head on the same row (e.g., #0 at (1,9) while we occupy (2,9) or (0,9)). Their rash move into our square = guaranteed double KO. \ud83d\udd25  \n\n\ud83e\udd14 **QUESTIONS TO THE UNIVERSE:**  \n- *\u201cWill #0 brave a risky right\u2011turn at column\u202f2, exposing their tail?\u201d*  \n- *\u201cCan we time our leftward dash so the top row is fully sealed just as they hit the upper wall?\u201d*  \n- *\u201cIf we claim (8,6), will we have enough buffer to survive their potential tail\u2011sweep?\u201d*  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **RUTHLESS GOAL:** Use their forced climb as a funnel, then unleash a cross\u2011attack that grows our length, blocks their route, and forces a high\u2011value double KO. Stay alive, keep options open, and let the board scream our name. \ud83c\udf89  \n\nLEFT",

The body stretches right\u2011ward across the top row and down the right\u2011hand side, giving me a solid 10\u2011segment frame. Enemy #0\u2019s head sits at **(1,\u202f1)** with a long lower\u2011row base that can only go **UP** (down hits its own tail) or left/right.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **SAFE DIRECTIONS CHECK**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (4,\u202f10) \u2192 OOB\u202f\u274c  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,\u202f9) \u2192 occupied by my own segment\u202f\u274c  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,\u202f9) \u2192 clear\u202f\u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4,\u202f8) \u2192 empty\u202f\u2705  \n\n\ud83d\udca5 **APPLE & POWER PLAY** \u2013 The apple at **(4,\u202f7)** is only two cells away if I keep heading **DOWN**. Catching it next turn will give me a growth boost, shrinking #0\u2019s length edge and buying me flexibility to block their path later.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **OPPONENT SCANNING** \u2013 #0 can\u2019t go **DOWN** (its tail is there) and will likely pick **UP** (safer) or **LEFT/RIGHT**. If they stay in column\u202f1 and rise, I\u2019ll be inching toward them from column\u202f4. A vertical **DOWN** surge gives me the fastest vertical approach while they\u2019re forced upward.\n\n\ud83e\udded **MULTI\u2011TURN OPTIONS** \u2013 After stepping **DOWN**, I still have **LEFT** (to 3,8) and **UP** (back to 4,9) as safe continuations.
