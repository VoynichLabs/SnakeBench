          "rationale": "The board is a 10x10 grid with coordinates (0,0) at the bottom-left and (9,9) at the top-right. I am Snake #0 at (7,8) with no body segments. The enemy Snake #1 is at (9,2) with no body segments. Apples are scattered across the board.\n\nMy current position is near the top-right, close to the right edge. From (7,8), I can consider moves:\n- UP: (7,9) \u2013 This is within the board (y=9 is valid). No obstacle listed there. Moving up keeps me close to the top edge but allows left/down moves next turn.\n- DOWN: (7,7) \u2013 This is within the board. The cell is empty (based on the board state). However, moving down might bring me closer to the center where apples are dense, but I need to consider the enemy's position.\n- LEFT: (6,8) \u2013 Within the board. The cell is empty. Moving left moves me away from the right edge and towards the center.\n- RIGHT: (8,8) \u2013 Within the board. The cell is empty. However, moving right brings me to x=8, which is close to the right edge (x=9). From there, my next move options might be limited because I cannot go further right without hitting the wall.\n\nI need to avoid immediate death. None of these moves hit a wall, my own body (I have none), or the enemy's body (enemy has none). So all four moves are initially safe.\n\nNow I must consider the enemy snake's possible moves. The enemy is at (9,2). They can move UP (9,3), DOWN (9,1), LEFT (8,2), or RIGHT (off-board, die). The enemy is likely to avoid suicide, so they probably won't move right. They might move up or left or down.\n\nI should consider head-on collisions: if I move to a cell where the enemy also moves to that same cell this turn, we both die. Since the enemy is at (9,2) and I am at (7,8), it's unlikely we collide directly this turn because we are far apart. However, I must be cautious about future turns.\n\nLong-term strategy: I need to collect apples to win. There are many apples on the board. I should aim for apples that are safe and reachable. From my position, nearby apples include:\n- (9,8) \u2013 very close, just one step right and then up? Actually, (9,8) is at x=9, y=8. I am at (7,8). So (9,8) is two steps to the right. If I move RIGHT to (8,8), then next turn I could move RIGHT to (9,8) to eat the apple. But moving right twice might trap me near the right edge. Alternatively, I could move UP to (7,9) and then left? But (9,8) is not directly accessible from there.\n- (8,8) is empty, so moving right is safe for now.\n- Other nearby apples: (5,9) is at top row, y=9, x=5. That is to the left and up from me. (6,1) is far down. (7,0) is far down. (4,2) etc. are scattered.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's potential path. The enemy is at (9,2). There are apples near the enemy: (9,8) is far from them, but (7,2) is at (7,2) which is close to enemy? Actually, enemy at (9,2), so (7,2) is two steps left. Also (8,2) is empty, (6,2) is empty? The board shows at y=2: \"A . . . A . . A . 1\" meaning: (0,2)=A, (1,2)=., (2,2)=., (3,2)=., (4,2)=A, (5,2)=., (6,2)=., (7,2)=A, (8,2)=., (9,2)=1. So there are apples at (4,2) and (7,2). The enemy might go for those.\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (8,2) or (7,2) to eat apple, that could be their plan. But they might also move UP or DOWN.\n\nI need to outwit the enemy. Perhaps I should move towards the center to have more options and access to more apples, rather than getting stuck at the edge.\n\nConsidering the board density: There are many apples in the lower left and center. From (7,8), moving LEFT to (6,8) brings me closer to the center and keeps me away from the edge. From there, I can go down or left to reach apples like (5,9) or others.\n\nLet's evaluate each move in terms of future flexibility:\n- UP to (7,9): This puts me at the top row (y=9). From there, I can only go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. RIGHT to (8,9) is possible, LEFT to (6,9), DOWN to (7,8). That's three options. But I am at the top edge, which might be limiting. There is an apple at (5,9) and (3,9), so moving left from (7,9) could lead to those. However, from (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe? Check board: at y=9, row: \"9 . . . A . A . . . .\" So (6,9) is empty, (5,9) is A, (4,9) is ., (3,9) is A. So yes, I can move towards those apples. But being at the top edge reduces my upward mobility.\n- DOWN to (7,7): This moves me down one step. From (7,7), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. That's four options, so more flexible. However, (7,7) is currently empty. There are apples below: (7,0) is far, but I could eventually go down. But going down might bring me closer to the enemy if they move up. The enemy is at y=2, I would be at y=7, still safe for now.\n- LEFT to (6,8): This moves me left one step. From (6,8), I have four directions: UP to (6,9) empty, DOWN to (6,7) empty, LEFT to (5,8) empty, RIGHT to (7,8) my old tail (but since I have no tail, it's empty). So plenty of options. Also, (6,8) is closer to apples like (5,9) and (4,2) etc.\n- RIGHT to (8,8): This moves me right one step. From (8,8), I can go UP to (8,9) empty, DOWN to (8,7) empty, LEFT to (7,8) empty, RIGHT to (9,8) which contains an apple! So if I move RIGHT now, next turn I can move RIGHT again to eat the apple at (9,8). However, from (8,8), moving RIGHT to (9,8) might be risky if the enemy also moves there? But the enemy is at (9,2), far away. They could move up multiple times, but in one turn they can only move one step. So it's unlikely they reach (9,8) this turn. But in future turns, if I go for (9,8), I might be trapped at the top-right corner. After eating (9,8), I would grow, so my body would be at (9,8) and tail at (8,8) maybe? Actually, when I eat an apple, I grow by one segment. My body would then be: head at (9,8), then previous head (8,8) becomes body, and tail remains? Since I had no body before, after eating, my body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)] with tail at (8,8). That's fine. But then from (9,8), I can only go DOWN (9,7), LEFT (8,8) which is my own body, so that's suicide. So after eating at (9,8), my only safe move would be DOWN to (9,7) (if empty) or maybe UP (but y=9 is top, so UP is invalid). So from (9,8), I would be forced to go DOWN or LEFT (but LEFT is into my body). So that could be dangerous if (9,7) is occupied or becomes a trap. Let's check (9,7): from the board, at y=7: \"7 . . A . . . . . . .\" So (9,7) is empty. So I could go DOWN to (9,7). Then from there, I could go DOWN further or LEFT. So it might be survivable. But it's still a risky path because I'm cornering myself.\n\nGiven that we are at turn 0 of 150, I have plenty of time. I should prioritize long-term survival and flexibility. Moving towards the center seems better than moving to the edge. Also, the enemy is on the right side (x=9), so moving left might give me more space away from them.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might move towards apples on the right side, like (7,2) or (4,2). If I go right, I might compete for apples on the right, but there are also apples on the left (e.g., (0,2), (0,4), (1,0), etc.). Since the board is symmetric, I can choose a direction that avoids direct competition.\n\nLet's think about immediate safety: all moves are safe. But I should avoid moves that could lead to a dead end. Moving RIGHT to (8,8) leads to a position where I have three safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) but not RIGHT after that if I don't eat apple? Actually, from (8,8), RIGHT to (9,8) is safe (apple), but then from (9,8) I am limited. So maybe avoid that for now.\n\nMoving LEFT to (6,8) seems to open up the board. From there, I can go to (5,8), (6,7), (6,9), etc. There is an apple at (5,9) which is two steps away: from (6,8) go UP to (6,9) then LEFT to (5,9). That seems safe.\n\nAlso, from (6,8), I can go DOWN to (6,7) and then further down towards apples in the lower center. There are apples at (6,1), (7,0), (5,0), etc. So left move gives me access to both upper and lower apples.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7,7) also opens up the board, but I'm still on x=7, which is somewhat right. From there, I can go left to (6,7) etc.\n\nMoving UP to (7,9) puts me at the top, which might be limiting but not terrible. However, there are apples at (5,9) and (3,9), so moving UP then LEFT could be a plan.\n\nI need to decide which move to make. I should also consider that the enemy might move in a way that affects me. Since the enemy is at (9,2), they are far away. I don't think they can collide with me this turn. But I should keep an eye on their potential movements.\n\nPerhaps I should move LEFT to avoid being near the enemy's side and to have more space. Also, moving left puts me closer to the center, where I can navigate better.\n\nLet's list the apples and see which are most accessible from each potential position:\n\nFrom (7,8):\n- Apple (9,8): distance 2 right (if I go right-right).\n- Apple (5,9): distance 2 left and 1 up (from (7,8) -> left to (6,8), up to (6,9), left to (5,9)).\n- Apple (3,9): further left.\n- Apple (7,0): far down.\n- Apple (6,1): far down-left.\n- Apple (4,2): far down-left.\n\nFrom (6,8) after left move:\n- Apple (5,9): two moves (up then left).\n- Apple (3,9): more moves.\n- Apple (6,1): straight down.\n- Apple (7,0): down-right.\n\nFrom (8,8) after right move:\n- Apple (9,8): one move right.\n- Then from (9,8), apple (9,2) is far down, but there is no apple at (9,2) actually; (9,2) is enemy. Apple at (7,2) is far left-down.\n\nFrom (7,9) after up move:\n- Apple (5,9): two moves left.\n- Apple (3,9): three moves left.\n\nFrom (7,7) after down move:\n- Apple (7,0): straight down.\n- Apple (6,1): left-down.\n\nAll seem viable, but I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nGiven that the game is long, I should aim for a balanced approach. I'll choose to move LEFT to (6,8) because it gives me the most options and moves me away from the right edge where the enemy might be active. Also, it sets me up to go for apples in the upper left (like (5,9)) or lower left (like (6,1)).\n\nI'll write my plan: \"Move left to (6,8) to avoid the right edge and increase flexibility. Then aim for apple at (5,9) or explore downward for other apples.\"\n\nNow, for the move: LEFT.\n\nBut wait, I must confirm that moving left is safe. At (6,8), is there any snake body? No, both snakes have no body. Is there an apple? The board shows (6,8) is empty (from the row y=8: \" . . . . . . . 0 . A\" actually, let's parse the board carefully. The board is given as:\n\n9 . . . A . A . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . 0 . A\n7 . . A . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . A . . . . . .\n4 A A . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 A . . . A . . A . 1\n1 . . . . . . A . . .\n0 . A . A . A . A . .\n\nRows from top (y=9) to bottom (y=0). For y=8: \". . . . . . . 0 . A\" meaning:\nx=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: ., x=4: ., x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: 0 (my head), x=8: ., x=9: A.\nSo (6,8) is x=6, y=8, which is \".\" empty. So safe.\n\nThus, LEFT is safe.\n\nI'll proceed with LEFT.\n\nFinal answer: LEFTBased on the current game state, I am at (7,8) with no body, and the enemy snake is at (9,2) with no body. All four possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are immediately safe as they do not hit walls, my own body, or the enemy's body. However, I need to consider long-term strategy and flexibility.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (8,8) would bring me close to the right edge and an apple at (9,8), but could trap me in the corner after eating, limiting future moves. Moving UP to (7,9) puts me on the top edge, reducing upward mobility. Moving DOWN to (7,7) is safe but keeps me on the right side of the board, potentially competing with the enemy's likely territory. \n\nMoving LEFT to (6,8) is the optimal choice because it moves me toward the center of the board, maximizing future options and avoiding the edge. From (6,8), I can access multiple apples (e.g., (5,9) by moving UP then LEFT, or (6,1) by moving DOWN) while maintaining escape routes. This also distances me from the enemy's starting position on the right, reducing immediate collision risk.\n\nLong-term plan: Move left to (6,8) to increase flexibility, then aim for the apple at (5,9) or explore downward for other apples. Stay adaptable and avoid trapping myself.\n\nLEFT",

Turn 2 of 150.\n\n**Immediate Safety Check:**\n- **UP (5,9):** Is (5,9) an apple? Yes. Is it safe? It's within bounds (0-9). It's not my body (I have none). Is it the enemy's body? No, enemy is at (7,2) and (8,2). Is it the enemy's head? The enemy head is at (7,2). So, moving UP is safe.\n- **DOWN (5,7):** Safe (empty cell).\n- **LEFT (4,8):** Safe (empty cell).\n- **RIGHT (6,8):** Safe (empty cell).\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **Goal:** Eat apples to grow and score. Survival is key.\n2.  **Enemy Awareness:** The enemy is at (7,2). That's far away (Manhattan distance of |5-7| + |8-2| = 2 + 6 = 8). We are not immediately threatening each other. The enemy has an apple at (5,9) just like I do. Wait, let me check the apples again.\n    *   Apples at: (1, 4), (7, 0), (6, 1), (4, 2), (0, 4), (9, 8), (0, 2), (2, 7), (1, 0), (3, 5), (3, 0), (5, 9), (3, 9), (5, 0), (5, 6)\n    *   I am at (5, 8).\n    *   Apple at (5, 9) is directly above me.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Move UP to (5, 9):**\n    *   **Gain:** I collect an apple immediately (1 point, grow by 1).\n    *   **Safety:** (5,9) is empty.\n    *   **Future Position:** I will be at (5,9). This is on the top edge.\n    *   **Trap Risk:** From (5,9), I can move DOWN (back to 5,8) or LEFT (4,9) or RIGHT (6,9). (5,10) is out of bounds. So I have 3 exits.\n    *   **Enemy Movement:** The enemy is at (7,2). If the enemy moves UP to (7,3), they are closer to me but still far. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (8,2), they hit their own tail (8,2) or the wall? (8,2) is their tail. Wait, let's re-read the rule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" The enemy body is [(8,2)]. If the enemy head is at (7,2), moving RIGHT goes to (8,2). That is the tail. Tails usually move forward, so (8,2) might be empty *before* the move, but the rule says \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\". The cell (8,2) is currently occupied by the enemy body. However, in Snake games, the tail moves *simultaneously* with the head. But the rule explicitly states \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die.\" It doesn't distinguish between tail and other body parts. So (8,2) is dangerous for the enemy. If the enemy moves UP to (7,3), it's safe for them. If they move DOWN to (7,1), it's empty. If they move LEFT to (6,2), it's empty (Apple at (6,1) is below it, but (6,2) is empty).\n    *   **Collision Risk:** If I go UP to (5,9), is there any path the enemy can take to hit me? Enemy is at (7,2). To hit me at (5,9) in one move, they'd need to jump 2 X and 7 Y. Impossible in one turn. So head-on collision is impossible this turn.\n\n4.  **Evaluating other moves:**\n    *   **DOWN to (5,7):** Hits apple (5,6)? No, (5,7) is empty. (5,6) is an apple but not in that cell. Moving down puts me closer to the center but misses the immediate apple at (5,9).\n    *   **LEFT to (4,8):** Empty. Misses (5,9).\n    *   **RIGHT to (6,8):** Empty. Misses (5,9).\n\n5.  **Comparison:**\n    *   Taking the apple at (5,9) scores a point and grows my body. Since I am currently size 1 (head only), growing means my tail (which is currently the same as my head) will stay put or the mechanics might vary, but effectively I gain length.\n    *   Waiting (not taking the apple) allows the enemy potentially to take it or block me.\n    *   The enemy is far away. They cannot steal (5,9) from me this turn.\n    *   Being at (5,9) (top row) limits my upward movement, but I still have 3 safe moves (Down, Left, Right). It's not a corner; it's an edge.\n    *   Being at (5,8) (center-ish) gives me 4 moves.\n\n    However, the rule says \"prefer moves that both increase your chance of safely eating apples\". Taking an apple is a guaranteed score. Not taking it risks losing it (if the enemy gets closer next turn) or simply delaying progress.\n\n    Is (5,9) a trap?\n    If I go to (5,9), I am at the top.\n    Next turn, I can go DOWN to (5,8) (where I am now), LEFT to (4,9), or RIGHT to (6,9).\n    (4,9) is empty. (6,9) is empty.\n    This seems fine.\n\n    Let's look at the board again.\n    Top row: `9 . . . A . A . . . .`\n    Wait, the apples listed are (5,9) and (3,9).\n    My position (5,8).\n    UP is (5,9). Apple confirmed.\n\n    Is there any reason *not* to take it?\n    If I move UP, I get bigger. Being bigger can be a disadvantage later (harder to maneuver), but early game, size is score and survival.\n    The enemy is at (7,2). They are chasing apples at (6,1) or (4,2) or (5,0). They are not coming for (5,9).\n    If I move UP, I am at (5,9).\n    If I move DOWN to (5,7), I am at (5,7). Apple at (5,6) is below. I could go down then down.\n    But (5,9) is right there.\n\n    Let's check the \"Last Move Rationale\" from the prompt.\n    The user's previous move was LEFT from (7,8) to (5,8)? No, the prompt says \"Turn: 2\", so this is the second turn.\n    The \"Last Move Information\" says \"Your last move information: ... LEFT ... Based on the game state, I am at (7,8)...\".\n    Wait, the current state says \"Head: (5, 8)\".\n    So the previous move was indeed LEFT from (7,8) to (5,8)? That's a jump of 2. That's impossible in one turn.\n    Let's re-read carefully.\n    \"Turn: 2 / 150\"\n    \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (5, 8)\"\n    \"My last move information: ... LEFT ... I am at (7,8)\".\n    Ah, the \"Last Move Information\" block is the *output* from the *previous* turn's decision making process. It describes the reasoning for the move that resulted in the current state.\n    So, the snake *was* at (7,8) in Turn 1.\n    It moved LEFT.\n    And landed at (5,8)? No, that would imply a jump.\n    Let's look at the board state provided in the prompt.\n    Row 8: `8 . . . . . 0 . . . A`\n    The '0' is at x=5, y=8.\n    The \"Last Move Rationale\" says \"Moving LEFT to (6,8) is optimal...\". Wait, the rationale says \"I am at (7,8)\".\n    If I was at (7,8) and moved LEFT, I should be at (6,8).\n    But the board shows '0' at (5,8).\n    There is a discrepancy in the prompt's description of the previous state vs the current board.\n    However, I must trust the provided \"Current State\" which is:\n    - Head: (5, 8)\n    - Board: `8 . . . . . 0 . . . A` (x=5)\n    \n    If the current head is (5,8), that is the ground truth.\n    (5,8) is empty? Yes, I am there.\n    (5,9) is above.\n    \n    Let's re-evaluate the \"Last Move Rationale\" text.\n    \"Based on the game state, I am at (7,8) ... Moving LEFT to (6,8) ...\".\n    This text is likely a copy-paste artifact or simulation of a previous thought process that doesn't perfectly align with the current coordinates provided in the board state.\n    Regardless, my current head is (5,8).\n\n    Let's look at the apples again.\n    Apples at: ... (5, 9), ...\n    My head is (5, 8).\n    Moving UP gets an apple.\n\n    Is there any threat?\n    Enemy at (7, 2).\n    Distance is large.\n    \n    Let's consider the \"Enemy snakes\" section.\n    Snake #1 - Head: (7, 2), Body: [(8, 2)].\n    If the enemy moves LEFT to (6, 2), it's safe.\n    If the enemy moves UP to (7, 3), it's safe.\n    If the enemy moves DOWN to (7, 1), it's safe.\n    If the enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 2), it hits its own body (8, 2). This would kill the enemy.\n    \n    If the enemy dies this turn, I survive.\n    If the enemy survives, they are still far away.\n    \n    Why might I *not* want to go UP?\n    1.  **Positional disadvantage:** Being on the top edge reduces my mobility to 3 options. Being at (5,8) gives me 4 options.\n    2.  **Trapping:** If I go to (5,9), I am at the top. If the enemy or obstacles block my exit paths later, I could be trapped.\n    \n    However, looking at the board:\n    Row 9: `9 . . . A . A . . . .`\n    (5,9) is an apple.\n    (4,9) is empty.\n    (6,9) is empty.\n    \n    If I move UP to (5,9), I eat the apple.\n    Next turn, I can move LEFT to (4,9), RIGHT to (6,9), or DOWN to (5,8).\n    \n    If I move LEFT to (4,8):\n    Next turn, I can go UP (4,9) (empty), DOWN (4,7) (empty), LEFT (3,8) (empty), RIGHT (5,8) (my old spot, now empty).\n    \n    If I move DOWN to (5,7):\n    Next turn, UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6) (Apple!), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7).\n    \n    If I move RIGHT to (6,8):\n    Next turn, UP (6,9) (empty), DOWN (6,7) (empty), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8) (empty).\n    \n    **Comparing Scoring:**\n    - UP: +1 Score immediately.\n    - DOWN: Close to (5,6) (Apple), but not immediate.\n    - LEFT/RIGHT: Not immediate.\n    \n    **Comparing Safety/Mobility:**\n    - Current (5,8): Mobility 4. Safe.\n    - (5,9): Mobility 3. Safe.\n    - (5,7): Mobility 4. Safe.\n    \n    **Is the apple at (5,9) worth the loss of mobility?**\n    In the early game (Turn 2), score is critical. The enemy has 1 apple, I have 0.\n    Eating the apple brings me to 1-1 tie (if the enemy didn't eat).\n    If the enemy is stuck or makes a mistake, I gain a lead.\n    \n    Let's think about the \"outwit him and outlast him\" goal.\n    If I take the apple, I grow. Being bigger makes me a slightly bigger threat but harder to maneuver.\n    If I don't take the apple, I stay size 1 (or whatever I am).\n    \n    Wait, looking at the \"Your snake\" block: \"Body: none\".\n    So I am size 1.\n    If I take the apple at (5,9), I will grow. My tail will remain where my head was (5,8) for the first turn of growth, effectively lengthening me.\n    \n    Is there any danger of the enemy reaching (5,9) next turn?\n    Enemy at (7,2).\n    Distance to (5,9): |7-5| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9.\n    Max speed 1 per turn. Impossible.\n    \n    Is there any danger of *me* being trapped at (5,9)?\n    Only if an enemy surrounds me.\n    If I am at (5,9) on Turn 3, and Enemy is at (7,2) or nearby.\n    If Enemy moves to (4,9) or (6,9) on Turn 3, I am blocked there.\n    But to get to (4,9) or (6,9) from (7,2) in 1 turn is impossible.\n    \n    So, (5,9) is safe for at least 2 turns.\n    \n    Let's look at the board layout.\n    `9 . . . A . A . . . .`\n    I am at (5,8). Apple at (5,9).\n    If I take (5,9), I am on the top row.\n    \n    What if I move DOWN to (5,7)?\n    I see an apple at (5,6).\n    From (5,7), I can go DOWN to (5,6) next turn and eat that apple.\n    That would be 2 turns for 1 apple.\n    Currently, I can eat (5,9) in 1 turn.\n    \n    Speed is usually important in Snake. Faster growth = better position = harder for enemy to compete.\n    \n    Let's consider the \"Turn: 2 / 150\".\n    The game is very young.\n    Early aggression for apples is good.\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Rules and win conditions\".\n    \"The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 30 apples.\"\n    We are nowhere near that.\n    \"If at any point all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\"\n    The enemy is at (7,2).\n    If the enemy moves RIGHT into (8,2) (its body), it dies.\n    If the enemy moves UP/DOWN/LEFT, it lives.\n    It's unlikely to commit suicide unless forced.\n    \n    Let's check the board for traps.\n    My current location (5,8).\n    If I go UP to (5,9), I am at the top edge.\n    The cells adjacent to (5,9) are (4,9), (6,9), (5,8).\n    (4,9) is empty.\n    (6,9) is empty.\n    (5,8) is currently me, will be empty after I move.\n    \n    Is there any apple at (4,9)? No.\n    Is there any apple at (6,9)? No.\n    \n    If I am at (5,9), I control the top edge.\n    \n    Let's look at the enemy again.\n    Snake #1: Head (7,2), Body [(8,2)].\n    Apples: 1.\n    The enemy has a body. This means if the enemy moves backwards into (8,2), it dies.\n    The enemy is at (7,2).\n    Right is (8,2) (Body).\n    Left is (6,2) (Empty).\n    Up is (7,3) (Empty).\n    Down is (7,1) (Empty).\n    \n    The enemy is likely to move Left, Up, or Down to survive.\n    \n    My decision: UP to (5,9).\n    Reasoning:\n    1.  Immediate apple score (+1).\n    2.  Catches me up to enemy (likely 1-1).\n    3.  Safety: (5,9) is safe from immediate collision. Enemy is too far to threaten.\n    4.  Future moves: Even though on the edge, I have 3 escape routes. (4,9), (6,9), (5,8).\n    \n    Alternative: DOWN to (5,7) to aim for (5,6).\n    This is also valid. (5,6) is an apple. (5,7) is safe.\n    However, (5,9) is closer (1 step) than (5,6) (2 steps).\n    Taking the closer apple is generally better.\n    \n    Is there any interaction with the enemy?\n    Enemy is at (7,2). Apple at (6,1) is close to enemy. Apple at (4,2) is close to enemy.\n    Enemy might go for those.\n    I am at (5,8).\n    I see apples at (5,9), (3,9), (9,8), (2,7), (3,5), (5,6).\n    My local cluster is (5,9), (3,9), (5,6).\n    \n    If I take (5,9), I am at (5,9).\n    Next turn, I can go to (4,9) or (6,9).\n    (3,9) is an apple. From (4,9), I can go to (3,9).\n    (5,6) is an apple. From (5,9), I can go DOWN to (5,8), then (5,7), then (5,6).\n    \n    It seems (5,9) keeps me in a good position to collect the top-row apples.\n    \n    Let's double check the board state provided.\n    `8 . . . . . 0 . . . A`\n    This confirms '0' is at (5,8).\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Last Move Rationale\" again.\n    \"Moving LEFT to (6,8) is optimal...\". This implies the previous head was at (7,8).\n    If the previous head was (7,8) and it moved LEFT, it would land at (6,8).\n    But the current board shows '0' at (5,8).\n    There is a coordinate mismatch in the prompt's history vs the board state.\n    The board state is the source of truth for the *current* position.\n    I must trust that my head is at (5,8).\n    \n    Is it possible the \"Last Move Rationale\" is from a different simulation?\n    Yes. I will ignore the specific coordinates in the \"Rationale\" text and trust the \"Board state\" and \"Your snake\" headers.\n    \n    So, Head at (5,8).\n    UP to (5,9).\n    \n    Is there any hidden trap?\n    What if the enemy moves UP and RIGHT? (7,2) -> (8,3). That's not hitting me.\n    What if the enemy moves UP twice? No, only 1 move.\n    \n    I will proceed with UP.\n    \n    Long-term plan:\n    1. Eat (5,9) now.\n    2. Move towards (3,9) or (5,6) depending on enemy movement.\n    3. Keep distance from enemy.\n    \n    Let's write the rationale.\n    \n    **Rationale:**\n    Current position (5,8). Apple at (5,9) is directly above.\n    Moving UP secures an immediate apple (+1 score), tying the score if the enemy doesn't eat (enemy is far away at (7,2)).\n    While moving to the edge (top row) reduces mobility to 3 directions, (5,9) is not a corner and offers safe exits to (4,9), (6,9), and (5,8).\n    The enemy is too distant (distance 8) to threaten collision this turn.\n    Alternative moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) delay scoring and offer no immediate strategic advantage over securing the apple.\n    \n    **Final Decision:** UP.\n\nOne more check on the board.\nRow 9: `9 . . . A . A . . . .`\nApples at (3,9) and (5,9).\nI am at (5,8).\nUP takes (5,9).\nIf I don't take it, I might lose it later.\nIf I take it, I grow.\nGrowth is good.\n\nWait, if I move UP, I land on an apple.\nRule: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point\".\nThis means my tail (which is currently empty, or effectively the same cell as head if size 1?) will stay put.\nActually, since my body is \"none\", I am effectively size 1 (head only).\nWhen I eat, I grow to size 2. My tail will be (5,8) and head (5,9).\n\nLet's consider the \"moving backwards\" rule.\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nIf I grow to size 2, next turn I can't move back to (5,8) immediately.\nBut that's next turn. For now, I just need to survive this turn.\n\nIs there any risk of the enemy moving to (5,9)?\nNo, as calculated, distance is too great.\n\nOkay, UP seems solid.\n\nWait, looking at the \"Rules and win conditions\":\n\"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\"\nMy body is empty now. So no protection there yet.\n\"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\"\nI am moving to (5,9). Enemy is at (7,2). Impossible to collide.\n\nConclusion: UP is safe and profitable.\n\nOne final check on the coordinates.\n(5,8) -> UP -> (5,9).\n(5,9) is within 0-9. Yes.\nIs it an apple? Yes, listed in \"Apples at\".\nIs it empty? Yes, board shows '.' at that position (Row 9, Col 5).\nIs it enemy body? No.\nIs it enemy head? No.\n\nLooks good.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nIf I am at (5,9) (having eaten the apple).\nI will look for the next apple.\n(3,9) is an apple. Left is (4,9) -> (3,9).\n(5,6) is an apple. Down is (5,8) -> (5,7) -> (5,6).\n(9,8) is an apple. Right is (6,9) -> (7,9) -> (8,9) -> (9,9) -> (9,8).\n(2,7) is an apple. Left/Down.\n(3,5) is an apple.\nI will likely pursue (3,9) next as it's adjacent to my path.\n\nRationale summary:\n1.  Immediate score.\n2.  Safe move (no walls, no self, no enemy).\n3.  Enemy too far to threaten.\n4.  Top edge position is manageable (3 exits).\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nMy body: None.\nEnemy body: [(8,2)].\nMy move UP to (5,9) doesn't interact with either.\n\nDouble check the \"Last Move Information\".\n\"Based on the game state, I am at (7,8) ... Moving LEFT to (6,8) ...\"\nThis is contradictory to \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (5, 8)\".\nI must assume the \"Head: (5, 8)\" is the correct current state for Turn 2.\nIf the history says I was at (7,8) and moved LEFT, but ended up at (5,8), that implies a jump or error in the history text.\nI will base my decision solely on the current board state provided: Head at (5,8).\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nFinal check of the \"Rules\" regarding \"moving backwards\".\nSince I have no body, I cannot hit myself.\nEven if I eat and grow, I cannot move backwards into myself *this turn* because I am moving into empty space.\nSo I am safe from the \"backwards\" rule.\n\nI will output UP.\n\nOne thought: The enemy has 1 apple. I have 0.\nCatching up is important.\nTaking the apple is the fastest way to catch up.\nIf I don't take it, and the enemy takes an apple next turn, I am 2 behind.\nIf I take it, I am 1 behind (or tied if enemy dies/fails).\nThis favors taking the apple.\n\nThe apple at (5,9) is a \"free\" apple.\nThere are no obstacles.\nThe enemy is far.\nI should take it.\n\nThe only downside is edge play.\n(5,9) is the top row.\nTop row limits movement to Down, Left, Right.\nThis is acceptable.\nMany Snake strategies involve wall-play or corner-play when safe.\nTop row is safe enough here.\n\nI will proceed with UP.\n\nRationale construction:\n- Current pos: (5,8).\n- Target: (5,9) (Apple).\n- Safety: Confirmed safe (no walls, no body, no enemy).\n- Enemy status: Too far (7,2) to collide or steal.\n- Strategic value: Immediate score. Catches up to enemy score. Grows snake.\n- Mobility: Moving to top edge reduces options slightly, but (5,9) is not a corner and offers sufficient escape routes.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nIf successful (at 5,9 with +1 apple), evaluate next move based on new enemy position. Likely target (3,9) or (5,6).\n\nOne small check:\nIs there any apple at (5,8)? No.\nIs there any apple at (4,8)? No.\nIs there any apple at (6,8)? No.\nSo, the *only* apple accessible in 1 move is (5,9).\nThis makes the choice very clear. Moving in any other direction does not yield an apple immediately.\nIn Snake, securing food is a primary objective if safe.\n\nFinal confirmation of move.\nDirection: UP.\nStart: (5,8).\nEnd: (5,9).\nValid? Yes.\n\nI will generate the response now.\n\nThe prompt asks for \"Ultrathink\".\nI have considered the immediate safety, the enemy's position, the distance, the scoring mechanics, the future mobility, and the board topology.\n\nI am confident in UP.\n\nWait, looking at the board again:\nRow 8: `8 . . . . . 0 . . . A`\nRow 9: `9 . . . A . A . . . .`\n(5,9) is an apple.\n(5,8) is me.\nThe cell (5,9) is directly accessible.\n\nIs there any scenario where I die?\n1. Wall: No.\n2. Self: No body.\n3. Enemy: Enemy at (7,2). Distance 8. No.\n4. Head-on: Enemy cannot reach (5,9). No.\n\nIs there any scenario where I *don't* want the apple?\nOnly if taking it puts me in a losing position immediately.\nIf I go to (5,9), I am on the edge.\nBut edges are not instant death. Corners are dangerous.\n(5,9) has neighbors (4,9), (6,9), (5,8).\nIf I am at (5,9) next turn, and enemy (somehow) is at (4,9) or (6,9), I am trapped.\nBut enemy starts at (7,2).\nTo get to (4,9) or (6,9) in 1 turn is impossible.\nTo get there in 2 turns?\n(7,2) -> (6,2) -> (5,2) ... no.\n(7,2) -> (7,3) -> (6,3) ... no.\n(7,2) -> (6,2) -> (5,3) ... no.\nThe enemy cannot reach the top row (y=9) in 2 turns from y=2. It would take at least 7 turns to reach y=9.\nI am safe on the top row for a long time.\nThe only danger is the enemy approaching from the side, but the board is wide.\nI am safe.\n\nThe move is definitely UP.\n\nI will write the rationale and the move.\n\nOne final check on the \"Rules\" regarding \"simultaneous movement\".\nIf I move UP to (5,9) and the enemy moves UP to (7,3), no collision.\nIf I move UP to (5,9) and the enemy moves UP to (7,3) and I have a body at (5,8) (after the move), and the enemy somehow ends up at (5,8)? Impossible.\nThe only way to interact is if we swap places or land on same cell.\nLanding on same cell: Impossible due to distance.\nSwapping places: Enemy would have to move to (5,8). Impossible due to distance.\n\nI am good.\n\nThe prompt requires \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n\nI will provide the thinking and then the move.\n\nOne detail: The \"Last Move Rationale\" mentions \"I am at (7,8)\".\nAs noted, this contradicts the \"Head: (5,8)\".\nI will ignore the history coordinate and use the provided current coordinate (5,8).\nIf I were to blindly follow the history, I would be at (7,8) -> LEFT -> (6,8).\nBut the board shows '0' at (5,8).\nIf the board is correct, I am at (5,8).\nIf I was at (7,8) and moved LEFT, I should be at (6,8).\nThere is a discrepancy of 1 unit in X.\nIf I am at (6,8), the apple is at (5,9) (Diagonal).\nWait. If I am at (6,8), then (5,9) is diagonally adjacent.\nSnake moves are orthogonal (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\nI cannot move diagonally.\nIf I am at (6,8), I cannot get to (5,9) in one move.\nI can get to (6,9), (7,8), (5,8), (6,7).\n(6,9) is empty.\n(5,8) is empty?\nIf I am at (6,8), then (5,9) is an apple I cannot reach.\nI would have to go to (5,8) or (6,9).\n(5,8) is empty. (6,9) is empty.\nNeither is an apple.\nThe apple at (5,9) is diagonal to (6,8).\nThe apple at (6,1) is far.\nThe apple at (9,8) is to the right.\nThe apple at (5,6) is down.\n\n**CRITICAL RE-EVALUATION BASED ON POSSIBLE COORDINATE ERROR**\n\nScenario A: I trust the Board State `0` at `(5,8)`.\n- Current: (5,8).\n- Apple: (5,9) is UP.\n- Move: UP.\n- Result: Eat apple.\n\nScenario B: I trust the History Rationale `(7,8)` -> `LEFT`.\n- Current: (6,8).\n- Apples near (6,8):\n  - (5,9): Diagonal. Not reachable.\n  - (9,8): Right. Far.\n  - (5,6): Down. Far.\n  - (6,1): Down. Far.\n- Safe moves from (6,8):\n  - UP: (6,9). Empty.\n  - DOWN: (6,7). Empty.\n  - LEFT: (5,8). Empty.\n  - RIGHT: (7,8). Empty.\n- None of these immediate moves collect an apple.\n- If I am at (6,8), I must choose a move that sets up a future apple.\n- From (6,8), I can go LEFT to (5,8). From (5,8), I can go UP to (5,9) next turn.\n- Or I can go UP to (6,9). From (6,9), I can go LEFT to (5,9) next turn.\n- Both (5,8) and (6,9) lead to (5,9) in 1 turn.\n\n**Which coordinate is correct?**\nThe board state is usually the most reliable \"current\" snapshot.\n`8 . . . . . 0 . . . A`\nThe '0' is at the 6th position (index 5). So x=5.\nThe row is row 8. So y=8.\nThus, (5,8) is correct.\n\nThe history text says \"I am at (7,8)\".\nThis is likely an error in the prompt's generated text, or a reflection of a state *before* the move that resulted in (5,8).\nWait, if I was at (7,8) and moved LEFT, I go to (6,8).\nBut the board says (5,8).\nThis implies a move of 2 units? Or the history text is wrong about the previous position.\nIf the history text is \"I am at (7,8)\", it might mean \"I *was* at (7,8) *before* my last move\".\nMy last move was LEFT.\nSo (7,8) -> LEFT -> (6,8).\nBut the board shows (5,8).\nThere is a 1-unit discrepancy.\nGiven the explicit board visualization `8 . . . . . 0 . . . A`, I must trust the visualization over the narrative text.\nThe '0' is clearly at x=5.\n\nHowever, let's look at the \"Your snake\" block.\n\"Head: (5, 8)\".\nThis is a text block explicitly stating the coordinates.\nThis confirms (5,8).\n\nSo, I am at (5,8).\nApple at (5,9).\nMove UP.\n\nWait, is there any chance the apple at (5,9) is a trap?\nSnake games often have \"dead ends\". (5,9) is the top row.\nIf I am at (5,9), I can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nIf the enemy is at (4,9), (6,9), and (5,8), I am trapped.\nBut the enemy is at (7,2).\nThis will take many turns.\nBy then, I will have eaten many apples and moved away.\nSo it's not a trap.\n\nThe only risk is if I am forced into a corner later.\nBut I can leave the top row whenever I want.\nSo it's safe.\n\nDecision stands: UP.\n\nOne final check on the \"Rules\" regarding \"moving backwards\".\nIf I move UP to (5,9), my tail (if I grow) stays at (5,8).\nNext turn, if I try to move DOWN back to (5,8), I will hit my own body (the tail).\nThis is a standard mechanic.\nI will just have to remember not to reverse immediately if I eat.\n\nOkay, writing the response.\n\nI will include a plan for the next turn in the rationale.\n\"Plan: Eat (5,9). Next turn, move towards (3,9) or (5,6).\"\n\nThe prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns.\"\nI will do that.\n\nFinal check on the output format.\n\"Exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n\"Do not add anything after that word.\"\n\"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo:\nRationale text...\nPlan text...\nUP\n\nThis looks correct.\n\nOne sanity check: Is there any apple closer than (5,9)?\n(5,8) is my current position. No apple there.\n(4,8), (6,8), (5,7), (5,9) are neighbors.\nOnly (5,9) has an apple.\nSo I am not choosing between multiple apples. I am choosing between taking the apple or moving away from it.\nTaking it is clearly superior.\n\nWhat if I am at (6,8) (if the history text is correct and the board is wrong)?\nThen (5,9) is not reachable.\nBut the \"Your snake\" block explicitly says \"(5, 8)\".\nI will stick with (5,8).\n\nRationale:\n- Current pos: (5,8)\n- Move: UP to (5,9)\n- Reason: Collect apple, score point.\n- Safety: Safe (no walls, no self, enemy far).\n- Future: Top edge, but manageable.\n\nPlan:\n- Secure food at (5,9).\n- Next move towards (3,9) or (5,6).\n\nMove: UP.\n\nI'm ready.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nMy body: None.\nEnemy body: [(8,2)].\nMy move UP to (5,9) does not interact with (8,2).\nEnemy head (7,2) cannot reach (5,9).\nI am safe.\n\nThe prompt says \"Be constantly aware of the enemy snake and be making plans to outwit him and outlast him.\"\nTaking apples is the best way to outlast (reach 30 apples) and outwit (denying them space/score).\nTaking (5,9) is a good start.\n\nI will output the response now.\n\nOne final check on the \"Turn: 2 / 150\".\nEarly game. Efficiency is key.\nDon't waste turns moving away from food without reason.\nThere is no reason to avoid (5,9).\nIt is not a trap.\nIt is not occupied.\nIt is food.\nI should eat it.\n\nFinal decision: UP.\n\nThe \"Last Move Rationale\" mentions \"My last move information: ... LEFT ...\".\nIf I moved LEFT, I came from the right.\nIf I came from the right, and I am at (5,8), where did I come from?\n(6,8) -> (5,8)? Yes, that is LEFT.\nIf I was at (6,8) and moved LEFT, I am at (5,8).\nThis aligns perfectly with the board state and the \"Last Move: LEFT\".\nThe text \"I am at (7,8)\" in the rationale is the error.\nThe move \"LEFT\" implies I was at (6,8) (or further right).\nThe result is (5,8).\nSo the state is consistent: I am at (5,8).\nThe history text has a typo (saying 7,8 instead of 6,8), or I skipped a square? No, snake moves 1 square.\nThe typo is in the text description of the previous head position.\nThe current head (5,8) is correct.\n\nSo, UP to (5,9) is definitely the move.\n\nReady.\n\nResponse structure:\n1. Analysis of current state.\n2. Evaluation of UP move.\n3. Comparison with alternatives.\n4. Safety check.\n5. Long-term plan.\n6. Final move: UP.Based on the game state, my snake is currently at (5, 8). The board shows an apple directly above me at (5, 9). The enemy snake is at (7, 2), which is far enough away that it cannot threaten me or steal the apple in this turn.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **UP (to 5, 9):** This move collects the apple immediately, scoring +1 point. This brings my score to 1, matching the enemy's score (assuming they don't score this turn). While moving to the top edge reduces my mobility from 4 directions to 3, (5, 9) is not a corner and offers safe exits to (4, 9), (6, 9), and (5, 8). The enemy is distance 8 away, so collision is impossible this turn.\n- **DOWN (to 5, 7):** Safe, but misses the immediate apple. The apple at (5, 6) is two moves away.\n- **LEFT (to 4, 8) or RIGHT (to 6, 8):** Safe, but also miss the immediate apple.\n\n**Strategy:**\nTaking the guaranteed apple is the optimal play. It secures a score early in the game (Turn 2/150) and grows my snake, which is crucial for survival and future positioning. Since the enemy cannot reach (5, 9) or interfere with this move, there is no downside to securing the point.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (5, 9). On the next turn, evaluate moving towards the cluster of apples at (3, 9) or descending toward (5, 6), while maintaining distance from the enemy snake.\n\nUP",
