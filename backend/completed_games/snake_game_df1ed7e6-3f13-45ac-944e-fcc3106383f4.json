Moving toward it might require going down and left.\n\nRelative positions:\n- The apple at (5,9) is directly above us (at (2,7)), with y = 9, which is two steps up in y-direction.\n- To reach it, the straightforward shortest route is to move UP, then continue toward x=5, or go directly up and then left.\n\nBut:\n- Moving UP (from (2,7) to (2,8)), then again UP (to (2,9)) if desired, may be safe.\n- The enemy snake at (9,6) is far to the right, so moving right is less dangerous directly, but being cautious about crossing that line if it moves.\n\nNext steps:\n- Moving UP is safe, as there's no immediate obstacle and will bring us closer to the apple at (5,9).\n- Moving LEFT could be dangerous if we go toward (1,1) which is at the bottom-left corner, and potentially more dangerous due to less space and proximity to walls.\n\nSafety check:\n- Moving UP: from (2,7) to (2,8). No walls, no snake nearby.\n- Moving RIGHT: towards (3,7), then (4,7), etc., but there is no immediate apple in that direction.\n- Moving LEFT: potentially toward (1,7), but the apple at (1,1) is far, and moving left is riskier if we go toward the bottom wall.\n- Moving DOWN: downward would take us away from the high-priority apple at (5,9) and might run into the wall soon if we go too far down.\n\nBased on this, the safest and most strategic initial move seems to be UP, aiming to approach the apple(s) in that direction, especially (5,9).\n\nNext, plan:\n- Moving UP: safe and progresses toward an accessible apple.\n- After moving up, we can decide to go left toward (5,9) or pursue other apples.\n\nDeciding next move: UP.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: UP**"

However, we\u2019d be stuck on the far right column a bit longer.\n\u2003\u2013 If we move LEFT to (8,5), our snake will be repositioned more toward the board\u2019s center. Then we can head DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4) and then further to (8,3) to get the apple.\n\n\u2022 Moving LEFT not only steers us toward the apple at (8,3) but also gives us greater room to maneuver in later turns.\n\nBased on this, my decided next move is: LEFT."

But wait: in the initial description, our snake is at (2,9), moving UP to (2,8). Now, the last move took us to (2,8), so moving UP again would be to (2,9). But that would cause us to go back\u2013possibly risky if the previous position is held or if the last move has just been made. Since no body exists yet, no problem there.\n\n- But considering movement choices, moving UP from (2,8) would take us back to (2,9), which is the starting position. That might be cycling, or perhaps we want to move forward toward nearby apples.\n\n- Alternatively, trying to reach apples directly to the right (at (9,8)) involves moving right multiple times.\n\n- Moving RIGHT from (2,8) would be:\n  - (3,8), (4,8), ..., approaching (9,8).\n  - To reach (9,8), we need to move right 7 times. Since we're only considering one move at a time, moving right now isn't optimal unless it gets us closer.\n\n- Moving LEFT isn't advisable because we're at x=2, close to the left wall at x=0, and we have apples at (1,1), (4,0), which are not immediately accessible.\n\n- Moving DOWN from (2,8) would take us away from apples at higher y-levels.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- Moving UP from (2,8) to (2,9) might reoccupy our initial position, but opening up the pathway to the top and the apple at (5,9) could be beneficial.\n\n- Moving RIGHT could be a good strategy to approach the apple at (9,8), especially since moving right multiple times is needed.\n\n- Since no immediate threats or obstacles are blocking our path, and we aim to approach nearer apples, especially the one at (9,8), shifting to the right seems strategic.\n\nTherefore, I will prioritize moving right now to begin closing the gap to the apple at (9,8), as it offers a tangible target.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"
