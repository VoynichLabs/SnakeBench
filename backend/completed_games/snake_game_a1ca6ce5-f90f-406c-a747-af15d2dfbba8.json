The apple at (2, 5) is directly below me, which looks like an efficient next move\n2. Moving down will allow me to collect this apple\n3. The board is mostly empty, giving me good mobility\n4. No risk of collision with walls or other snakes\n5. Collecting apples early will help me grow and score points\n\nPotential Next Turn Strategy:\n- After collecting the apple at (2, 5), I'll start planning a route to other nearby apples\n- Keep an eye on potential paths to maximize apple collection\n- Maintain awareness of the enemy snake's position\n\nRationale for Current Move:\n- Direct path to an apple\n- Safe movement\n- Incremental growth strategy\n\nNext move: DOWN"
