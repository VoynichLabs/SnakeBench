It occupies critical spaces slightly below my position, blocking direct vertical access to the apple at (0,3).

This is beneficial for immediate growth.\n- UP: Position (7,1) also has an apple, making it another immediate beneficial option.\n- RIGHT: Would make me collide into position (8,0), now occupied by my own body, resulting in immediate death\u2014invalid.\n- DOWN: Would move me off-board at position (7,-1)\u2014invalid.\n\nThreats:\n- Enemy snake (#2) located at (7,3) and (6,3). It seems not to pose an immediate direct threat to positions (6,0) or (7,1), although we must remain cautious about future positioning.\n- My own body length and position require careful planning. Taking either apple immediately is safe, but considerations about next moves are important to avoid self-trapping in a corner.\n\nStrategic Consideration for Choosing Between LEFT (6,0) and UP (7,1):\n1. LEFT (6,0):\n   - Immediate apple.\n   - After eating, limited immediate safe maneuverability but can possibly proceed upwards next.\n   - More confined positioning near corner, slightly higher risk of getting trapped later.\n   \n2. UP (7,1):\n   - Immediate apple.\n   - Offers slightly more open maneuvering opportunities in subsequent moves. For instance, I might next move left or upwards to continue towards other apples like (7,5).\n   - Keeps me away from immediate corners, reducing risk of entrapment.\n\nThus: choosing UP at (7,1) seems smarter tactically\u2014immediate apple, plus greater long-term positioning flexibility.\n\nNext-turn reminder strategy:\n- Stay cautious of your own growing tail and enemy snake movements.\n- After taking apple at (7,1), plan carefully a path towards other apples at (7,5), (2,4), or (0,6).\n- Pay special attention to your tail's position to avoid getting trapped or boxed into corners.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
