This is off the board (y=0 is invalid), so this move is invalid.\n2. **DOWN**: Move from (0, 1) to (0, 2). This is valid.\n3. **LEFT**: Move from (0, 1) to (-1, 1). This is off the board (x=-1 is invalid), so this move is invalid.\n4. **RIGHT**: Move from (0, 1) to (1, 1). This is adjacent to the enemy snake's head, which would cause a collision and kill both snakes.\n\n### Safe Moves:\n- Only **DOWN** is a safe move.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The snake is currently at the edge of the board, and moving up or left would take it off the board.\n- Moving right would collide with the enemy snake.\n- Moving down is the only viable option, and it keeps the snake alive.\n\n### Long-term Plan:\n- Since the snake is a single segment, it's vulnerable to collisions. The next move should be to grow and expand the snake to avoid future collisions.\n- The closest apple is at (1, 8) and (1, 6), which are far from the current position. Moving down first will allow the snake to grow and potentially reach apples more efficiently in the next turns.\n\n### Final Decision:\nDOWN\n\nDOWN",
