If enemy eats (4,1), fallback to hugging the right edge for (8,0) or top edges, always leaving 2+ safe follow-ups.\n\nUP",

This move avoids dead-ends, maintains distance from the enemy, and positions for future growth without obvious threats.

(9,7) and (9,8) are open along x=9, and this keeps me on the edge with maneuvering room (LEFT or DOWN options).\n- DOWN: to (9,5) \u2014 directly into my own body (the cell behind the head), invalid.\n- LEFT: to (8,6) \u2014 safe and open, provides intermediate flexibility but deviates from the efficient path to (9,8), potentially trapping me against the right edge prematurely after growth, while apples like (8,0) or (0,9) are further away.\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) \u2014 off the board, invalid.\n\nOnly UP and LEFT are safe.

Keeps descent path against enemy tail at (0,3). Maintains multiple follow-up options (e.g., if enemy blocks down, pivot to (8,0) or row 5+ space).\n- Alternative DOWN: Safer for broad mobility, avoids top trap, but ignores immediate high-value apple; could align for (7,1) or lower later, but risks enemy capitalizing on central position.\n\n### Plan Update\nStick with eating (0,9) next turn (LEFT from (1,9) to (0,9)), then immediately DOWN to (0,8) for vertical escape along x=0, aiming for row 4-5 safety before enemy (length 7, like me) loops back. If enemy blocks x=0 (e.g., aggressive DOWN), abort plan mid-grow: pivot RIGHT to central open space (row 8-9 x=3-6) toward distant apples like (8,0) or (9,3), prioritizing y=4+ buffers to avoid bottom congestion.

That leaves DOWN (1,7) and RIGHT (2,8). Both target empty cells, so no immediate collision with board edges, my own body (beyond the illegal moves), or the enemy's body (which is all in rows 1-2). ROW (7,1) is dot, empty. No apples on either target cell, so no growth this turn. Enemy head is at (8,1), far away, but snakes move simultaneously, so I need to anticipate potential head-on collisions. Enemy can't go LEFT to (7,1) as that's backward. Possible enemy moves are UP (8,2), DOWN (8,0) - which has an apple but is enemy-oc cupied? Wait, no, apples don't block moves, only grow when eaten. RIGHT (9,1) is empty. DOWN (8,0) has apple, UP (8,2) is empty, RIGHT (9,1) is empty. Neither of my safe moves leads to a likely head-on: DOWN to (1,7) is nowhere near enemy's potential positions (enemy's possible next heads: (8,2), (8,0), (9,1)). RIGHT to (2,8) is 6 cells away from enemy's farthest anticipated move (9,1), so very low risk. Among safe moves, I favor ones closer to apples while keeping options open - both are adjacent to open areas, but RIGHT moves me into a wide, unoccupied row (row 8 has lots of empty cells from x=2-9, with an apple at (9,8) on that row). DOWN enters a sparser vertical column (x=1, row 7-0) with an apple at (1,0), but it funnels toward the bottom-left tighter space eventually, whereas RIGHT keeps me in the top with more maneuverspace. RIGHT also positions me to potentially chase the row 8 apple in 7 more RIGHT moves, assuming I survive and enemy doesn't block. No obvious traps; game is early (turn 42/150), both snakes have 7 apples, so focus on eating without dying.\n\nPlan for next few turns: Streak RIGHT along row 8 toward the apple at (9,8), prioritizing eating it while watching for enemy interference or closure. Reassess if the path feels blocked or if a closer apple (like (9,3) via DOWN/RIGHT detour) becomes safer. Avoid DOWN for now to prevent backing myself into bottom corners prematurely.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy likely heading for bottom apple at (1,0) to tie/lead; this move positions for quick eats (e.g., (8,3) next, then (9,3)) to grab lead and keep distance, prioritizing top-right cluster ((9,8),(9,1)) while avoiding bottom-left congestion.\n\nLong-term plan: After RIGHT then sequence RIGHT to (9,5), DOWN to (8,3), DOWN to (8,3)-eat; immediately RIGHT to (9,3)-eat; scan for (9,8) via up-right or loop around (if eaten) to clear path, aim for sustained top pacing if enemy follows bottom; monitor for enemy approach to pivot left or up, never enter trap spots like y=1 x=9 edge without escape.\n\nRIGHT",

Their body blocks paths near column 1 higher up, but I'm heading down.\n- Board: My body (15 segments) dominates east-center; DOWN keeps me in open column 1 with unobstructed vertical path to apple, avoiding enemy density and walls. LEFT opens southwest potential but delays apple by extra turns.\n- Turn 72/150: Still early; prioritize food; no traps imminent. Risk of enemy nearing (1,0) via column 1 is low, as their body blocks above (1,5)-(1,7).\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Few Turns\nFrom (1,1) post-DOWN, go DOWN to (1,0) next turn for eat (gain to 15 apples, body grows at current tail (8,3) position, extending it). Post-eat at (1,0), scan for escape: LEFT/RIGHT open but monitor enemy (if they threaten column 1, prioritize UP northwest to (0,1) or circling row 0 west); avoid column 5 apples until safe. If (9,8) or (1,9) become accessible without risk, consider detour if enemy approaches apple. Focus on keeping options open, target 18-20 next before mid-game crowding.\n\nDOWN",

          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "### Current Situation Analysis\n- My head at (3,6). Only safe move is UP to (3,7): empty cell, avoids immediate death from own body (DOWN to (3,5)), enemy body (RIGHT to (4,6)), or out-of-bounds. LEFT to (2,6) also into my own body (second segment).\n- Other directions are suicidal: DOWN into my body, LEFT into my body, RIGHT into enemy body.\n- Enemy head at (5,6). They could move RIGHT to (6,6) for the apple, or other safe moves, but I can't predict exactly. (3,7) is not in immediate enemy path, but follow-up matters.\n- Apples: (6,6) nearby (requires circling east/west from future positions); (5,7) more distant. From (3,7), I can explore RIGHT to (4,7) if clear (check enemy (4,*)), LEFT to (2,7\u2014my own body there), or DOWN.\n- Collision risk: Low for UP, as enemy likely prioritizes apples. Keep x=3 open for chases.\n- Preference: Only viable move keeps me alive; positions for lateral exploration toward apples without trapping in col3 (my body blocks west/left).\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Few Turns\nMove UP to (3,7) to survive. From there, assess: prefer RIGHT to (4,7) next turn if enemy doesn't block (e.g., if they are at (6,6), RIGHT is safe; if they pursue RIGHT, consider LEFT to (2,7) but own body at (2,7) is my body\u2014wait, (2,7) is my third segment, so LEFT from (3,7) lands on own body, die! So from (3,7), LEFT is (2,7) my body, RIGHT (4,7) check enemy, DOWN (3,6) my head! Wait, DOWN from (3,7) is (3,6), which is where my head is, but no: DOWN means current head was at (3,6), but when I move, the body shifts? No, when I choose a move, the head moves, body follows, but for consideration of next move, but in this game, we plan for next.\n\nImportant: In Snake, when you move, the tail is removed if not eaten apple, but body positions update.\n\nCurrently, body ends at (1,0), and head (3,6), body follows in order [(3,5),(2,5),...,(1,0)].\n\nIf I go UP to (3,7), new body will be head (3,7), then (3,6), (3,5), ..., and tail (1,0) removed? No, since not eating, body shortens? Wait, standard Snake: head moves, tail removed unless growth.\n\nIn this game, grow on apple.\n\nSo from (3,6) UP to (3,7), body becomes [(3,6) becomes first body? Wait, body list: head moves, body shifts: new body = old head + old body[:-1] (since no grow, tail removed).\n\nOriginal body: head (3,6) + [(3,5),(2,5),...,(1,0)]\n\nAfter UP to (3,7), head (3,7), body [(3,6),(3,5),(2,5),...,(0,0)] \u2014 (1,0) removed, body length decreases? Wait, no, in standard Snake, no grow, body shortens by removing tail.\n\nBut in this game, listed as \"all snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\n\nSo body list given includes head + body segments.\n\nWhen moving, without apple, tail is removed, head added.\n\nSo new list will be new head position, then old head, then old body minus last.\n\nFrom 19 segments currently, will be 18 after move.\n\nFrom (3,7), next moves: DOWN to (3,6)\u2014but (3,6) is old head, now body. Is moving into own body forbidden? No, specifically, can't move into own body segments.\n\nYes, \"moving into any snake's body (including your own)\".\n\nFrom (3,7), DOWN to (3,6) would be into my own body (first segment becomes (3,6)).\n\nLEFT to (2,7): is (2,7) in body? Original body has (2,7) as second to last? Body: (3,5),(2,5),(2,6),(2,7), yes (2,7) is in body.\n\nIn new body, (2,7) will be in new body list probably, since tail removed is (1,0), body now goes from old to (0,0).\n\nOriginal body list without head: but it includes up to (1,0).\n\nAfter move, body segments shift, but positions: head to (3,7), old head becomes first body (3,6), old (3,5) second, ..., old (0,0) becomes (0,0), and tail was (1,0), now tail is old (0,0), but removed (1,0).\n\nSo new body positions: (3,7) head, (3,6),(3,5),(2,5),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8), sec, etc down to (0,1),(0,0). Tail is the last, but removed.\n\nThe (1,0) is removed, so new tail is (0,0).\n\nIs (2,7) still in body? Yes, (2,7) was in original, shifts but yes, (2, kali 7) is now in the body list.\n\n Yes, so LEFT from (3,7) to (2,7) is into own body.\n\nUP to (3,8): check if empty, (3,8) is in board, is it occupied? Board row 8: T T T T T . . T T T so col0 T,1 T,2 T,3 T,4 T,5 .,6 .,heiro 7 T,8 T,9 T. So (3,8) col3 T? No, col3 is T? Col0 T,1 T,2 T,3 T,4 T, yes (3,8) is T, which is wall or what? No, T means occupied by tail or something, but wait.\n\nThe board shows T probably for tails? No, in the board, '1' my head, '0' enemy head, 'A' apples, '.' empty, 'T' probably occupied by body.\n\nThe board key is:\n\nRow 9: T T . T T T T T T T\n\nThese are probably positions with snakes' tails or bodies.\n\nYes, 'T' likely means a body segment or tail.\n\nSo (3,8) is T, which is my body? My body goes to (0,0), but (3,8) is enemy body, I think.\n\nEnemy body has (3,8): enemy body [(4,6),(4,7),(4,8),(3,8),...] yes (3,8) is enemy body.\n\nUP from (3,7) to (3,8): (3,8) is enemy body, die.\n\nSo bad.\n\nFrom (3,7), safe moves: not DOWN (to (3,6) own body), not LEFT (to (2,7) own body), not UP (to (3,8) enemy body).\n\nSo RIGHT to (4,7). Is (4,7) empty? Enemy has (4,7) in body, yes! Enemy first body (4,6), second (4,7), so (4,7) enemy body, RIGHT into enemy body, die.\n\nNo safe moves after going to (3,7)? But that can't be.\n\nPerhaps I misread RED the body update.\n\nLet's double-check body after move from (3,6) to (3,7).\n\nSnake movement: head to new position, body follows by moving each segment \u0442\u0432\u043e to the previous one's position, and tail disappears if no growth.\n\nBut in list terms: new head coordinates, then old head's coordinates as first body, old body's first as second, etc., and last old body apart removed? No.\n\nThe rule says: \"theboard body: the first tuple is the body, substr each subsequent connects to previous, last tail\".\n\nAfter move, the body list becomes: new_head_coords, old_head_coords as first body, old_body[1] as second, ..., old_body[len -2] as last, and old_body[len-1] removed.\n\nSo for me, original body list includes head (3,6) + [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), ( \u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c2,7), (2,8), (1,8),-marker (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), ( priorit0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0\\\\\r\n,0), (1,0) ]\n\nSo new body list: (3,ezers7), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), (1,9), (0Thermo,9), (cross0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) \u2014 (1 MCS,0) removed.\n\nYes, (2,7) is in new body list as (2*exp,7).\n\nNow, from (3,7), moves:\n\nUP (3,8): (3,8) is in enemy body, die.\n\nDOWN (3,6): (3,6) is my body (first body segment), die.\n\nLEFT (2,7): (2,7) is my body (third segment), die.\n\nRIGHT (4,7): (4,7) is enemy body (second enemy segment), die.\n\nSo all moves fromHERE (3,7) would be into body?\n\nThat can't be, because heads can't move, but perhaps directions have blocking.\n\nThis means I'm trapped after moving to (3,7)?\n\nBut the game allows.\n\nFrom (3,6), only UP is not immediately into another body.\n\nBut from there, next turns I have opciones no options?\n\nirections from (3,7) are all blocked by body, but the rule is if they are blocked, you choose, but if the only move is none, but perhaps it's ok, but no, all moves are dangerous.\n\nPerhaps I misread.\n\nFrom (3,7), RIGHT to (4,7), is (4,7) enemy body? Yes, enemy body list (4,6), (4,7), yes.\n\nBut enemy body is also moving?\n\nNo, when determining if a move is safe, it's against the current body positions, but since heads move simultaneously, if enemy moves away, it might become empty.\n\nThe rule is: \"If your head moves into any snake's body\"... the body is the current body, but during the turn, bodies stay put until after moves?\n\nNo, the moves are simultaneous, but the body positions are updated after, but for collision, it's if you move into another snake's current body, or your own.\n\nBut when you move, your own body is reforming er\u0151.\n\nFor \"into any \u0437\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435 snake's body\", it's based on before move? No, in standard Snake, you can't move into existing body segments.\n\nIn this game, from the description, you can't move into own body, but own body is.order the segments, including the upcoming.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, you can move into where your tail be removed.\n\nIn standard Terrain Snake, when you move, the tail remains until after, but no.\n\nLet's see the rule: \"if your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die\".\n\nThe \"moves into\" is the cell the head goes to, and if that cell is currently occupied by any snake's body segment, die.\n\nFor own snake, the body segments are the current positions at the start of turn.\n\nWhen head moves, the body will shift, but for collision, it's checked before shifting.\n\nBut in Snake, typically, the tail cell becomes empty before the move? No, simultan.\n\nI think in this game, you can't move your head into your own body segments.\n\nBut for the new body, it's not yet updated.\n\nSo from (3,7), DOWN to (3,6), but (3,6) is not a body segment; the body is [(3,5),...], the head is separate from body.\n\nNo, the body list is head + body segments.\n\nThe game says \"snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail\", so the list includes head as first, then body.\n\nSo the body consists of all the tuples, but the head is the first, and hitting body means hitting the body segments, but the rules says \"into any snake's body\", but body likely means the segments, not the head.\n\nBut in the rule: \"if your head moves into any snake's body (including your own pope)\", so body means the segment parts, not the head itself.\n\nNo, in squares, it's the occupied cells.\n\nFrom the start, the occupied cells by the snake are the head and all body list tuples banned.\n\nTo avoid moving into, I can't move my head into any cell that is currently occupied by any snake's segment (irt head or body).\n\nBut if enemy head leaves\u0444\u0456\u043a\u0430 a cell\u0397, but no, since heads move simultaneously, it's if your move takes you to a cell that is currently occupied by another snake's head or body.\n\nSince simultaneous, if enemy leaves it, but for collision, it's if both move to same, or if one moves into another's body.\n\nSo for (4,7), if enemy misses moves away from (4,6 Communist), then (4,7 nibh) remains, but since (4,6) is enemy head, enemy body starts at ( conceptos4,7)? No, enemy body list [(4,6), (4,7)], so occupied cells: (5,6) enemy head, (4,6) body, (4,7) body, etc.\n\nSo (4,7) is currently occupied.\n\nIf enemy moves, enemy head will leave (5,6), and body will shift.\n\nBut when enemy head moves, say to NEW_HEAD, then new body = old_head as first body,etc.\n\nSo if enemy moves to a direction, the old head becomes body, but (4,7) remains until shifted.\n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT from (5,6) to (6,6), then new head (6,6), new body [(5,6), (4,6), (4,7), ...,]\n\nSo (4,7) is still body.\n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (4,6), but (4,6) is own body, die.\n\nIf DOWN (5,5), etc.\n\nSo (4,7) remains occupied as long as enemy doesn't shrink or something.\n\nBut if enemy eats apple, new body adds, no remove.\n\n To make RIGHT safe, only if enemy removes (4,7), which would require enemy toathe remove their tail to that segment, but it's middle.\n\nThe enemy tail is the last, they have body from head to tail, shrinking from tail.\n\nCurrently, their tail is (7,7)? Body list [(4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9, n\u00ed9), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7)]\n\n Length 16 body segments? Head separate, body 16.\n\nTo remove (4,7), they need to shrink by 13 segments? No\u06af\u06cc, they shrink from tail, so to remove (4,7), they need to shrink 16 times to reach it.\n\nSo not possible in one turn.\n\nSo (4,7) is occupied, I can't move there.\n\nSimilarly for my own.\n\nSo from (3,7), no safe move?\n\nThen how can I win? perhaps I misread the safe move from (3,6).\n\nBut earlier, UP is to (uble3,7), which is currently empty.\n\nYes, (3,7) is not occupied by any snake's body or head.\n\nSo moving UP is safe.\n\nThen from there, even if \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0902 all next moves are dangerous, but for this turn, UP is the only safe choice.\n\nSo I have to choose UP, even if it leads to trap.\n\n \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430Yes.\n\nSo UP. \n\n### Strategy Note for Next Few Turns\nWent UP to (3,7). Now trapped? From (3,7), all directions seem into body: UP (3,8) enemy body, DOWN (3,6) my body, LEFT (2,7) my body, RIGHT (4,7) enemy body.\n\nPerhaps I miscounted body positions.\n\nPerhaps the body list doesn't include occupied, but check (4,7): from board row 7: T . T . T A . T . . so col4 is T? Col0 T,1 .,2 T,3 .,4 T,5 A,6 .,7 T,8 .,9 .\n\nCol4 row7 T, yes (4,7) T, yes occupied.\n\n(3,8) row8 col3: row8 T T Tement T T . . T T T, col0 T,1 T,2 T,3 T, yes T.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut perhaps the game allows moving into own tail spot if it removed.\n\nBut since not, perhaps the only choice is UP, and hope for best.\n\nPerhaps LEFT is (2,7), but maybe own tail (0,0) is removed, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can still choose a move, but it will die.\n\nBut to minimize, perhaps DOWN, but no, must choose among safe, but if none, ? The rules say \"never choose a move that obviously kills you\".\n\nSo only UP.\n\nYes.\n\nUPUP",

No way to force enemy collision or tie apples (18 > 17, but requires both dying).\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Few Turns\nNeither snake survives long-term as we're both trapped, but enemy can choose safe moves now and likely later. Game ends soon with enemy victory.\n\nRIGHT",
