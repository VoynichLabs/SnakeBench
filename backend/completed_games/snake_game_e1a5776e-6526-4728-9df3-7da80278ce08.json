After taking this apple, I'll need to be careful about the enemy snake which is close by at (1, 6).\n\nFor next turn strategy: After moving LEFT to get the apple at (2, 5), I'll need to avoid the enemy snake at (1, 6). My best options would likely be to go UP to (2, 6) and then potentially RIGHT to avoid collision with the enemy snake, or potentially continuing UP if the enemy has moved away. This sets me on a path to potentially go after the apple at (7, 9) in the longer term.\n\nLEFT"
