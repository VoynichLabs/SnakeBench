More apples collected gives me an advantage over the enemy to win the game.\n\n2. **Current Apple Locations**  \n   Apples are at (2, 2), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 0), and (7, 3).  \n   - The closest apple, based on my starting position at (3, 8), is the one at (3, 9). It\u2019s just one step *up*. Prioritizing the closest apple makes sense as it minimizes risks.\n   - The next nearest apples after that will depend on my new position after reaching (3, 9).\n   \n3. **Snake and Board Strategy**  \n   - There is currently one enemy snake (Snake #0) at (7, 7). It is far from my target apple at (3, 9). For now, the enemy snake does not pose a direct threat.\n   - I also need to avoid the board boundaries at all times. For instance, moving \"up\" towards (3, 9) is safe, as it stays within bounds and avoids the enemy snake.\n\n4. **Last Move Recap**  \n   - I haven\u2019t made any moves yet, so I have no constraints related to my body. I can move freely in any valid direction.\n\n5. **Planned Move**  \n   - The apple at (3, 9) is just one step *up* from my current position (3, 8). Moving up is safe and aligns with my objective.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**  \n   - After eating the apple at (3, 9), I\u2019ll re-evaluate the board to choose my next target. The apples at (3, 5) or (2, 2) might become the next goals depending on my position and the situation with Enemy Snake #0.\n\n**Next Move:** UP"
