This is not a safe move.\n- RIGHT to (8, 0): This is within board boundaries. It does not collide with my body segments as the tail at (4, 0) will vacate. It does not collide with the enemy head at (6, 7). This is a safe move.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (7, 1) and RIGHT to (8, 0).\n\nLet's determine the closest apple(s) from my current head position (7, 0) using Manhattan distance:\n- Distance to (8, 2): |7-8| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- Distance to (8, 1): |7-8| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- Distance to (6, 8): |7-6| + |0-8| = 1 + 8 = 9\n- Distance to (9, 5): |7-9| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n- Distance to (2, 0): |7-2| + |0-0| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (8, 1) with a Manhattan distance of 2. The next closest is at (8, 2) with a distance of 3.\n\nNow let's evaluate the outcome of the safe moves in relation to the closest apple (8, 1):\n- Moving UP to (7, 1): My new head position is (7, 1). The distance to the closest apple (8, 1) becomes |7-8| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1. This move brings me one step closer to the apple. I do not eat an apple this turn.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8, 0): My new head position is (8, 0). The distance to the closest apple (8, 1) becomes |8-8| + |0-1| = 0 + 1 = 1. This move also brings me one step closer to the apple. I do not eat an apple this turn.\n\nBoth safe moves position me one step away from the closest apple at (8, 1), allowing me to reach it on the next turn. Moving RIGHT to (8, 0) places me in the same column (x=8) as the two closest apples ((8, 1) and (8, 2)). This positioning seems advantageous for collecting these nearby apples efficiently in subsequent turns. Both moves are equally safe and efficient for reaching the immediate closest apple. I will choose the move that aligns me best with the cluster of closest apples.\n\nThe next move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT"

My length is 5.\nThe board size is 10x10 (0-9 for both x and y).\nApples are located at: (8, 2), (9, 5), (2, 0), (8, 6), (3, 2).\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (7, 8) with body at [(6, 8)].\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves from my current head position (8, 1):\n- UP to (8, 2): This is within board boundaries. This position currently contains an apple. Moving here would allow me to eat the apple. It does not collide with my body segments [(8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0)] as my tail at (5, 0) will vacate if I don't eat, or the body shifts if I do eat. It does not collide with the enemy head at (7, 8) or body at (6, 8). This is a safe move.\n- DOWN to (8, 0): This is within board boundaries. This position is currently occupied by my body segment (my neck). Moving here would cause a collision with myself. This is not a safe move.\n- LEFT to (7, 1): This is within board boundaries. This position is empty. It does not collide with my body segments (tail at (5,0) vacates). It does not collide with the enemy head or body. This is a safe move.\n- RIGHT to (9, 1): This is within board boundaries. This position is empty. It does not collide with my body segments (tail at (5,0) vacates). It does not collide with the enemy head or body. This is a safe move.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (8, 2), LEFT to (7, 1), and RIGHT to (9, 1).\n\nLet's determine the closest apple(s) from my current head position (8, 1) using Manhattan distance:\n- Distance to (8, 2): |8-8| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n- Distance to (9, 5): |8-9| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- Distance to (2, 0): |8-2| + |1-0| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- Distance to (8, 6): |8-8| + |1-6| = 0 + 5 = 5\n- Distance to (3, 2): |8-3| + |1-2| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThe closest apple is at (8, 2) with a Manhattan distance of 1.\n\nNow let's evaluate the outcome of the safe moves:\n- Moving UP to (8, 2): This move lands exactly on the closest apple at (8, 2). I will eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. My new head will be at (8, 2).\n- Moving LEFT to (7, 1): This move does not land on an apple. My new head will be at (7, 1). The distance to the closest apple (8, 2) becomes |7-8| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 1): This move does not land on an apple. My new head will be at (9, 1). The distance to the closest apple (8, 2) becomes |9-8| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nMoving UP to (8, 2) is the optimal move as it directly reaches and consumes the closest apple. This is a safe move and improves my score and length.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move directly towards the closest apple if it is a safe move. The closest apple is at (8, 2), and moving UP is safe and takes me there.\n\nThe next move is UP.\n\nUP"

This is a safe move.\n- DOWN to (7, -1): This is outside the board boundaries (y=-1). This is not a safe move.\n- LEFT to (6, 0): This position is currently occupied by my body segment (my immediate past head position). Moving here would cause a collision with myself. This is not a safe move.\n- RIGHT to (8, 0): This is within board boundaries. It does not collide with my body segments as the tail at (4, 0) will vacate. It does not collide with the enemy head at (6, 7). This is a safe move.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (7, 1) and RIGHT to (8, 0).\n\nLet's determine the closest apple(s) from my current head position (7, 0) using Manhattan distance:\n- Distance to (8, 2): |7-8| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- Distance to (8, 1): |7-8| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- Distance to (6, 8): |7-6| + |0-8| = 1 + 8 = 9\n- Distance to (9, 5): |7-9| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n- Distance to (2, 0): |7-2| + |0-0| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (8, 1) with a Manhattan distance of 2. The next closest is at (8, 2) with a distance of 3.\n\nNow let's evaluate the outcome of the safe moves in relation to the closest apple (8, 1):\n- Moving UP to (7, 1): My new head position is (7, 1). The distance to the closest apple (8, 1) becomes |7-8| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1. This move brings me one step closer to the apple. I do not eat an apple this turn.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8, 0): My new head position is (8, 0). The distance to the closest apple (8, 1) becomes |8-8| + |0-1| = 0 + 1 = 1. This move also brings me one step closer to the apple. I do not eat an apple this turn.\n\nBoth safe moves position me one step away from the closest apple at (8, 1), allowing me to reach it on the next turn. Moving RIGHT to (8, 0) places me in the same column (x=8) as the two closest apples ((8, 1) and (8, 2)). This positioning seems advantageous for collecting these nearby apples efficiently in subsequent turns. Both moves are equally safe and efficient for reaching the immediate closest apple. I will choose the move that aligns me best with the cluster of closest apples.\n\nThe next move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT"

This position is empty. It does not collide with my body segments [(8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0)] as my tail at (5, 0) will vacate. It does not collide with the enemy head at (8, 8) or body at (7, 8). This is a safe move.\n- DOWN to (8, 1): This is within board boundaries. This position is currently occupied by my body segment (my neck). Moving here would cause a collision with myself. This is not a safe move.\n- LEFT to (7, 2): This is within board boundaries. This position is empty. It does not collide with my body segments (tail at (5,0) vacates). It does not collide with the enemy head or body. This is a safe move.\n- RIGHT to (9, 2): This is within board boundaries. This position is empty. It does not collide with my body segments (tail at (5,0) vacates). It does not collide with the enemy head or body. This is a safe move.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (8, 3), LEFT to (7, 2), and RIGHT to (9, 2).\n\nLet's determine the closest apple(s) from my current head position (8, 2) using Manhattan distance:\n- Distance to (9, 5): |8-9| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- Distance to (2, 0): |8-2| + |2-0| = 6 + 2 = 8\n- Distance to (8, 6): |8-8| + |2-6| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- Distance to (3, 2): |8-3| + |2-2| = 5 + 0 = 5\n- Distance to (9, 0): |8-9| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThe closest apple is at (9, 0) with a Manhattan distance of 3. The next closest are (9, 5) and (8, 6) at distance 4.\n\nNow let's evaluate how the safe moves affect the distance to the closest apple (9, 0):\n- Moving UP to (8, 3): Distance to (9, 0) from (8, 3) is |8-9| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4. Distance increased.\n- Moving LEFT to (7, 2): Distance to (9, 0) from (7, 2) is |7-9| + |2-0| = 2 + 2 = 4. Distance increased.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 2): Distance to (9, 0) from (9, 2) is |9-9| + |2-0| = 0 + 2 = 2. Distance decreased.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 2) brings me closer to the closest apple (9, 0). It also brings me closer to the apple at (9, 5) (|9-9|+|2-5| = 0+3=3, distance decreased from 4). Moving UP also decreases the distance to (9, 5) and (8, 6).\n\nMy strategy is to move towards the closest apple while staying safe. Moving RIGHT is a safe move that reduces the distance to the closest apple (9,0) and one of the next closest (9,5).\n\nThe next move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT"

It does not collide with my body segments [(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)] as my tail at (4, 0) will vacate. It does not collide with the enemy head at (6, 7). This is a safe move.\n- DOWN to (7, -1): This is outside the board boundaries (y=-1). This is not a safe move.\n- LEFT to (6, 0): This position is currently occupied by my body segment (my immediate past head position). Moving here would cause a collision with myself. This is not a safe move.\n- RIGHT to (8, 0): This is within board boundaries. It does not collide with my body segments as the tail at (4, 0) will vacate.

The next closest is at (8, 2) with a distance of 3.\n\nNow let's evaluate the outcome of the safe moves in relation to the closest apple (8, 1):\n- Moving UP to (7, 1): My new head position is (7, 1). The distance to the closest apple (8, 1) becomes |7-8| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1. This move brings me one step closer to the apple. I do not eat an apple this turn.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8, 0): My new head position is (8, 0). The distance to the closest apple (8, 1) becomes |8-8| + |0-1| = 0 + 1 = 1. This move also brings me one step closer to the apple. I do not eat an apple this turn.\n\nBoth safe moves position me one step away from the closest apple at (8, 1), allowing me to reach it on the next turn. Moving RIGHT to (8, 0) places me in the same column (x=8) as the two closest apples ((8, 1) and (8, 2)). This positioning seems advantageous for collecting these nearby apples efficiently in subsequent turns. Both moves are equally safe and efficient for reaching the immediate closest apple.

My length is 5.\nThe board size is 10x10 (0-9 for both x and y).\nApples are located at: (8, 2), (9, 5), (2, 0), (8, 6), (3, 2).\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (7, 8) with body at [(6, 8)].\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves from my current head position (8, 1):\n- UP to (8, 2): This is within board boundaries. This position currently contains an apple. Moving here would allow me to eat the apple. It does not collide with my body segments [(8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0)] as my tail at (5, 0) will vacate if I don't eat, or the body shifts if I do eat. It does not collide with the enemy head at (7, 8) or body at (6, 8). This is a safe move.\n- DOWN to (8, 0): This is within board boundaries. This position is currently occupied by my body segment (my neck). Moving here would cause a collision with myself. This is not a safe move.\n- LEFT to (7, 1): This is within board boundaries. This position is empty. It does not collide with my body segments (tail at (5,0) vacates). It does not collide with the enemy head or body. This is a safe move.\n- RIGHT to (9, 1): This is within board boundaries. This position is empty. It does not collide with my body segments (tail at (5,0) vacates). It does not collide with the enemy head or body. This is a safe move.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (8, 2), LEFT to (7, 1), and RIGHT to (9, 1).\n\nLet's determine the closest apple(s) from my current head position (8, 1) using Manhattan distance:\n- Distance to (8, 2): |8-8| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n- Distance to (9, 5): |8-9| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- Distance to (2, 0): |8-2| + |1-0| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- Distance to (8, 6): |8-8| + |1-6| = 0 + 5 = 5\n- Distance to (3, 2): |8-3| + |1-2| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThe closest apple is at (8, 2) with a Manhattan distance of 1.\n\nNow let's evaluate the outcome of the safe moves:\n- Moving UP to (8, 2): This move lands exactly on the closest apple at (8, 2). I will eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. My new head will be at (8, 2).\n- Moving LEFT to (7, 1): This move does not land on an apple. My new head will be at (7, 1). The distance to the closest apple (8, 2) becomes |7-8| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 1): This move does not land on an apple. My new head will be at (9, 1). The distance to the closest apple (8, 2) becomes |9-8| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nMoving UP to (8, 2) is the optimal move as it directly reaches and consumes the closest apple. This is a safe move and improves my score and length.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move directly towards the closest apple if it is a safe move. The closest apple is at (8, 2), and moving UP is safe and takes me there.\n\nThe next move is UP.\n\nUP"

This is a safe move.\n- RIGHT to (9, 1): This is within board boundaries. This position is empty. It does not collide with my body segments (tail at (5,0) vacates). It does not collide with the enemy head or body. This is a safe move.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (8, 2), LEFT to (7, 1), and RIGHT to (9, 1).\n\nLet's determine the closest apple(s) from my current head position (8, 1) using Manhattan distance:\n- Distance to (8, 2): |8-8| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n- Distance to (9, 5): |8-9| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- Distance to (2, 0): |8-2| + |1-0| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- Distance to (8, 6): |8-8| + |1-6| = 0 + 5 = 5\n- Distance to (3, 2): |8-3| + |1-2| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThe closest apple is at (8, 2) with a Manhattan distance of 1.\n\nNow let's evaluate the outcome of the safe moves:\n- Moving UP to (8, 2): This move lands exactly on the closest apple at (8, 2). I will eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. My new head will be at (8, 2).\n- Moving LEFT to (7, 1): This move does not land on an apple. My new head will be at (7, 1). The distance to the closest apple (8, 2) becomes |7-8| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 1): This move does not land on an apple. My new head will be at (9, 1). The distance to the closest apple (8, 2) becomes |9-8| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nMoving UP to (8, 2) is the optimal move as it directly reaches and consumes the closest apple. This is a safe move and improves my score and length.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move directly towards the closest apple if it is a safe move. The closest apple is at (8, 2), and moving UP is safe and takes me there.\n\nThe next move is UP.\n\nUP"
