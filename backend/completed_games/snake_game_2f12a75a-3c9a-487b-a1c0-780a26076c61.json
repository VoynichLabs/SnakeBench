However, moving DOWN to (2,4) is very straightforward and keeps our snake moving in a predictable vertical line. This can make our subsequent planning easier, as we\u2019ll then have control over where to go next without running into our own body. Meanwhile, the enemy snake is far off at (7,7) with its body at (7,6), so there\u2019s no immediate threat in moving downward.\n\nThus, to secure another apple and maintain a safe route, the best next move is DOWN.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

For instance, the apple at (1,2) is only a few moves away via either route. If we choose DOWN from (3,3) to (3,2), we could then move left twice to reach (1,2). Alternatively, by moving LEFT from (3,3) to (2,3), we are already directly moving horizontally toward the apple; a follow\u2010up move downward from (2,3) leads to (2,2), and then one more LEFT brings us right to (1,2). \n\nI favor the LEFT move because it begins to align our head with the apple\u2019s x-coordinate immediately, and it minimizes any chance of inadvertently boxing ourselves in with our trailing segments. There are no obstacles on (2,3) and it puts us in good shape to continue our pursuit of points with future moves.\n\nMy decided move: LEFT."

This would start progressing toward the apple at (4,6) directly, but it keeps us on the same row.\n\u2022 UP \u2013 Moves us to (0,7), which is also clear. Although it takes us vertical, it opens up potential for more flexible maneuvering in coming moves (for example, we can later head rightward from a higher row to reach the apple without risk of immediate self\u2013conflict).\n\nAnalyzing the board carefully:\n\u2022 The board row 6 reads: \"1 . . . A . . . . .\", so we see that while the apple is on our row (at (4,6)), we might find it beneficial first to go UP to give us a better angle when navigating around our own body. \n\u2022 Also, by moving UP to (0,7), we avoid crowding the row that contains the apple and can plan a smoother journey rightwards.\n\nThus, following our previous analysis and rationale:\n\u2013 The safest and most strategic next move is to head UP.\n\nNext move: UP."

The apple positions we see (at (5,1), (1,3), (6,4), (3,6), and (3,4)) remain accessible later. For now, our goal is to keep alive and to avoid collisions. The analysis shows that of our four potential directions, only moving LEFT is safe immediately.\n\nTherefore, my decided next move is: LEFT."
