Let\u2019s break down the board and plot the takeover. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Quick Scan:**  \n- My head: (6, 3)  \n- Enemy head: (3, 5)  \n- Apples are scattered. Enemy is NE of me, but not an immediate collision threat this turn (he's 3 units away diagonally).  \n- Board is open. I have zero apples, he has zero. No score advantage yet.  \n- Important: I must NOT move into his body (none) or my own body (none).  \n- Must also avoid moving off board.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**  \n- **UP** to (6, 4): On board, no apple. Safe. Opens path to (6,5) next.  \n- **DOWN** to (6, 2): On board, has apple at (6,2)! That\u2019s an immediate +1. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** to (5, 3): On board, empty. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** to (7, 3): On board, empty. Safe.\n\n**Aggression Check:**  \nI want to grow early to apply pressure. Eating the apple at (6,2) gives me the lead and forces enemy to react. Also, moving down keeps me closer to the bottom-right apple cluster (9,0) and (8,1) later.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note:**  \nGrab the apple at (6,2) now. Then cut across the bottom toward (9,0) or (8,1) to build length and block enemy\u2019s access to the right side. Keep eyes on enemy\u2019s path\u2014force him into a corner.\n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN is safe, gives an apple, and sets up a strong position. Let\u2019s eat.\n\nDOWN",

Who's ready to box him in?! \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick state check (turn 0): My head = (3,5). Enemy head = (6,3). No bodies. Apples are sprinkled \u2014 important ones near us: (4,4) and near him: (6,2). Scores tied 0-0.\n\nDecision walkthrough (thinking out loud for the fans):\n1) Consider moves from (3,5):\n   - UP \u2192 (3,6)\n   - DOWN \u2192 (3,4)\n   - LEFT \u2192 (2,5)\n   - RIGHT \u2192 (4,5)\n2) Immediate death checks:\n   - No move goes off-board. There are no bodies to hit (both snakes length 1). All four moves are safe this turn. \u2705\n3) Opponent likely moves:\n   - From (6,3) they can go to (6,2), (6,4), (5,3), (7,3). The most tempting is DOWN to (6,2) to nab an apple immediately. That makes them grow fast if we let them.\n4) Strategic priorities:\n   - We're tied on apples \u2014 avoid forcing a head-on collision unless we have a numeric advantage. Don\u2019t throw it away.\n   - We should contest reachable apples and keep many follow-up options open so we can pivot to box them later.\n5) Comparing our candidate moves:\n   - UP (3,6): moves into more space and toward apples like (3,8)/(4,7), but a bit slower to contest nearby apples.\n   - RIGHT (4,5): moves toward the apple at (4,4) but doesn\u2019t get us immediately closer than DOWN would.\n   - LEFT (2,5): retreats and gives them space \u2014 not aggressive.\n   - DOWN (3,4): positions us to reach (4,4) quickly (next turn RIGHT), keeps four-way escape options, and directly contests central apples. It also helps us influence the middle where we can start hemming them in later.\n6) Risk analysis:\n   - No immediate head-on risk this turn from any choice. DOWN keeps multiple safe follow-ups and pressures the contested area. It doesn\u2019t overcommit or box us in against walls.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move DOWN to approach and contest the (4,4) apple. If they go for (6,2), let them grow but use the center control to cut their corridors later.\n- After securing (4,4), pivot toward the central corridor (x\u22484\u20136, y\u22482\u20135) to limit their escape routes. Force them toward the board edge or try to bait a head-on when we have the apple advantage.\n\nTime to make the move \u2014 keep it clean, keep it smart, and let\u2019s start the squeeze. You ready?

My snake (ID 0) starts at (6, 2) with a tail at (6, 3). Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 4) with no body. Apples are scattered, but the closest apple to me is at (4, 2) \u2014 that's a juicy target. Enemy is NE, so not an immediate threat, but I need to dominate the board.  \n\n**Move Evaluation:**  \n- **UP** to (6, 3): This is my own tail! Wait, no \u2014 my head is at (6, 2), and my tail is at (6, 3). Moving UP into my own tail is allowed because it moves away simultaneously? Actually, careful: if I move UP, my head goes to (6, 3), which is currently occupied by my tail. But since all moves happen at once, my tail will move away from (6, 3) as I move there? In snake games, if you move into a cell your tail was in, it's usually safe because the tail moves first. However, to be safe, let's check if (6, 3) is free after my move. Since I'm growing later if I eat an apple, but on this turn, I'm not eating an apple yet. Actually, I'm starting with 1 apple already collected, so I'm length 2. Moving into my tail is typically safe because the tail vacates. But let's confirm: my body is [(6, 3)] \u2014 that's one segment after head. If I move UP to (6, 3), that cell is occupied by my body. In standard snake rules, moving into your own body (except the tail that's about to move) is death. But since my tail is the only body segment, and it will move when I move, it might be safe. However, to avoid risk, I'll avoid UP for now.  \n- **DOWN** to (6, 1): On board. Empty? Check: (6,1) is empty in board state (row 1: . . . . . . . A A .). Yes, empty. Safe. Opens path to (6,0) or (7,1) for apples.  \n- **LEFT** to (5, 2): On board. Empty? Row 2: . . . . A . 0 . . . So (5,2) is empty. Safe. Moves toward (4,2) apple.  \n- **RIGHT** to (7, 2): On board. Empty? Row 2: (7,2) is empty. Safe. Opens path to (8,2) or (7,1) apple.\n\n**Aggression & Strategy:**  \nEnemy is at (3,4). If I move LEFT to (5,2), I get closer to apple at (4,2). That's 2 units away. Eating that apple gives me +1 and grows me to length 3, putting me at 2 apples vs enemy's 0. That's a lead! Also, moving LEFT positions me to cut off enemy's access to bottom-right. If I go DOWN or RIGHT, I'm heading toward apples at (6,1) or (7,1), but (4,2) is more direct and central. I must avoid head-on collisions: if enemy moves toward me, I could die, but he's far.  \nLong-term: After eating (4,2), I can move toward (4,4) or (3,8) to control mid-board. Keep enemy confined.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT is the best move. It gets me closer to an apple, keeps options open (UP, DOWN, RIGHT next turn), and maintains aggression. Let's go!\n\nLEFT  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Board is 10x10. Apples are all over, but I'm focusing on my enemy and board control.  \n\n**Move Evaluation:**  \n- **UP** to (5, 3): Empty? Check board: Row 3 is all dots, so safe. But this moves me away from the apple at (4, 2) and closer to enemy territory. Not ideal.  \n- **DOWN** to (5, 1): Empty? Row 1: (5,1) is dot, safe. Could go for apple at (4,2) next, but down might lead to bottom edge, limiting options.  \n- **LEFT** to (4, 2): That's an apple! Apple drop (4,2) exists. If I eat it, I grow to length 3, score 2 vs enemy's 1. Safe? (4,2) is empty on board (row 2: . . . . A . 0 . . .). No snakes there. My tail moves from (6,2) to (5,2) after move, so no self-collision. Enemy is at (4,4), not blocking. This puts me directly below enemy, ready to challenge them.  \n- **RIGHT** to (6, 2): That's my current tail! Moving into my own tail is safe because tail moves away simultaneously. But it's not progressing toward any apple or enemy\u2014just staying put. Wasted turn.  \n\n**Aggression & Strategy:**  \nI'm tied 1-1 in apples. Eating (4,2) gives me the lead and grows me. Enemy is at (4,4)\u2014if I move LEFT, I position to potentially cut them off from apples to the right. If enemy moves down, they might collide with me? Unlikely, but I'll watch for head-on. Long-term: After eating, I can aim for (3,8) or (4,8) to dominate mid-board and box enemy in from the left.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT is the move! It eats the apple, grows me, and sets up aggressive positioning. Let's go!  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating, chase enemy toward top-left, force them into a trap. Avoid getting sandwiched\u2014keep multiple escape routes.  \n\nLEFT",

Dead move. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (4,5): safe, lots of space, keeps options open.

Puts pressure on them near the bottom. \u2705 (safe, aggressive)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,4): safe and directly into their column \u2014 can threaten cuts later, but bumps toward potential head-on lines if we close too fast. \u2705 (risky-aggressive)\n\nHead-on risk check: scores are tied (1\u20131). We should AVOID forcing a head-on unless we have a numeric advantage. None of the three safe moves cause an immediate head-on this turn, but RIGHT can more quickly create a same-cell contest later. DOWN pressures them while keeping options to dodge a forced head-on next turn.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next couple turns):\n- Move DOWN to (4,3) to pressure the enemy near y=2 and to threaten the (4,2) apple on the following turn.\n- If they go for the apple and we\u2019d collide, don\u2019t go for a simultaneous head-on \u2014 dodge and keep alive; bait them toward the left wall and then cut off escape routes along x\u22484\u20136.\n- Keep trailing options open (avoid committing to a single narrow corridor) so we can pivot and force them into the board edge where we can trap and finish.\n\nLet\u2019s get in their face and start the squeeze.

Let's break this down live:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My head at (4,2), body at (5,2), (6,2)\n- Enemy snake #1 head at (4,3), body at (4,4)\n- I'm directly below the enemy!

No snake bodies. My tail will move from (6,2) to (5,2) after move. Safe from self-collision.

But this moves me further down toward the edge, potentially limiting my options and separating me from the main action near the enemy.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nChat, here's the play! I just ate and grew - now I need to be SMART about positioning. The enemy is right above me at (4,3). If I go LEFT to (3,2), I:\n- Create distance between us (avoiding potential head-on)\n- Keep multiple escape routes (down to (3,1), left to (2,2), or even right back to (4,2) next turn)\n- Position myself to potentially cut off enemy access to apples on the left side\n- Maintain aggression without risking my lead\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,1), I'm retreating toward the bottom edge, which could box me in later. With my length 3, I need to keep options open!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving LEFT, I'll have options to:\n1. Go for the apple cluster at (1,1), (3,8), or (4,8)\n2. Continue shadowing the enemy from a safer distance\n3. Set up a trapping maneuver from the left side\n4. Keep my lead and eventually force a collision when I have a clear advantage\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nLEFT is the move! It's safe, aggressive, and keeps my future options WIDE OPEN!

Actually, if they go DOWN to (3,2), they'd be moving into my current head position AFTER I move. This is getting complex! Let me think: If I go UP and they go DOWN, we swap positions? No, we move simultaneously. If I go UP to (3,3) and they go DOWN to (3,2), then at turn end: I'm at (3,3), they're at (3,2). That's safe! BUT if they also go UP to (3,3), we both die. Risky when I have the lead!\n4. **DOWN to (3,1):** Row 1 shows (3,1) is \".\" (empty). Safe. Moves me toward bottom edge but still has space.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nChat, here's the play! The enemy is RIGHT above me at (3,3). I have TWO safe options:\n\n**Option A: LEFT to (2,2)** - Creates separation, moves me to open space, keeps options wide open for next turn (can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT again). This is the SAFE, SMART play.\n\n**Option B: UP to (3,3)** - This is the AGGRESSIVE play! If the enemy moves ANYWHERE except UP, we're SAFE and I maintain position. If they move UP, we both die (but I have more apples so I'd win if that's the only kill). BUT there's a BETTER play...\n\n**Option C: DOWN to (3,1)** - Also safe, but moves toward the edge, potentially limiting future options.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI'm going with **LEFT to (2,2)**! Here's why:\n1. It's 100% SAFE - no collision risk with enemy (they're above me, not left)\n2. It moves me to OPEN space with multiple escape routes\n3. It keeps my lead (2-1) without risking a head-on collision\n4. It positions me to potentially cut off enemy access to apples on the left side\n5. It maintains aggression while being SMART about my lead\n\nIf I go UP and the enemy goes UP, we both die and I win on apples (2-1). BUT if I go UP and they go DOWN or LEFT, we're both safe. Going LEFT is just cleaner positioning!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving LEFT, I'll be at (2,2) with body at (3,2) and (4,2). Next turn I can:\n1. Go UP to (2,3) to shadow the enemy\n2. Go for the apple at (1,1) \n3. Continue LEFT to (1,2) to dominate the left side\n4. Set up a trapping maneuver\n\nI'm keeping my lead and playing SMART!

Quick clean read and play-by-play:\n\nImmediate 4-way scan from our head (3,3):\n- RIGHT -> (4,3): ILLEGAL \u2014 that\u2019s our neck (backwards). Dead move. \u274c\n- DOWN  -> (3,2): RISKY \u2014 currently the opponent\u2019s head. If they hold or move UP, we can end in a head-on / mutual death. They\u2019ve got 2 apples vs our 1, so we don\u2019t want a double KO. Avoid unless we have the lead. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- UP    -> (3,4): SAFE \u2014 empty, keeps distance, plenty of space. Not aggressive though. \u2705\n- LEFT  -> (2,3): SAFE & aggressive \u2014 keeps pressure on their flank, helps start corralling them toward the left wall while preserving multiple follow-ups (UP/LEFT/DOWN). \u2705\u2705\n\nWhy LEFT?\n- Keeps options open (we can keep cutting off their left escape or pivot up if they try to run).\n- Avoids a risky head-on with a higher-scoring foe.\n- Maintains board pressure \u2014 we want to box them in, not trade deaths. Can force them into tighter turns and capitalize on mistakes.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep pressuring left-side lanes; if opponent moves left, follow and tighten the box. If they try to flee down, DON\u2019T follow straight into their head \u2014 pivot up-left to cut escape lanes.\n- Only force a head-on if we gain an apple advantage. Otherwise, play the flank and starve them of space.\n- Watch for apples only as bait \u2014 we grow when it helps trap them, not at the cost of position.\n\nLET\u2019S GO \u2014 make him choke on his own tail.

Turn 5 and we're LEADING 2-1! \ud83d\ude24 Let's break this down LIVE!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head at (2,2), body at (3,2), (4,2) - length 3\n- Enemy snake #1 head at (2,3), body at (3,3) - length 2 (1 apple)\n- We're STACKED vertically - I'm at (2,2) and enemy is at (2,3) directly ABOVE me!\n- Board is WIDE OPEN on the left side\n\n**ELIMINATION PROCESS:**\n1. **UP to (2,3):** Enemy head is EXACTLY there! If we both move UP, head-on collision = double death. But I have MORE apples (2-1) so I'd win if we BOTH die! BUT... risky when I have the lead. \u274c\n2. **LEFT to (1,2):** Row 2 shows (1,2) is \".\" (empty). Safe! No collision. Moves me LEFT toward the apple at (1,1). \u2705\n3. **RIGHT to (3,2):** That's my CURRENT body segment! Moving into myself = instant death. \u274c ELIMINATED!\n4. **DOWN to (2,1):** Row 1 shows (2,1) is \"A\" (APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e). Safe to move there! But wait... if I eat it, I GROW. But the apple is at (2,1) - actually checking the board state, (2,1) is an apple! BUT... careful with growth. \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nChat, here's the situation! The enemy is RIGHT above me at (2,3). We're in a COUNTER position - I can go LEFT to (1,2) or DOWN to (2,1).\n\n**Option A: LEFT to (1,2)** - Safe, moves toward the apple at (1,1), positions me to dominate the left side, keeps my lead. The enemy could go DOWN to (2,2) but that's where I WAS (empty after I move). Or they could go LEFT to (1,3) or RIGHT to (3,3).\n\n**Option B: DOWN to (2,1)** - This is an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e But (2,1) is an apple in the map! I'd grow to length 4 and lead 3-1! BUT... if I eat it, my tail grows, which could affect movement later. Still, getting more apples = better lead!\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI'm going with **LEFT to (1,2)**! Here's why:\n1. It's 100% SAFE - no collision risk\n2. It moves me CLOSER to the apple at (1,1) for next turn\n3. It positions me to CONTROL the left side of the board\n4. If the enemy goes DOWN to (2,2), they're stepping where I just left - safe for me\n5. If the enemy goes LEFT to (1,3), we're side by side - I can still maneuver\n6. Going DOWN to eat the apple would put me at (2,1), but then next turn I'd be near the edge with fewer options\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (1,2), I'll be positioned to:\n1. Go DOWN to (1,1) next turn and eat that apple (leading 3-1!)\n2. Go UP to (1,3) to shadow/attack the enemy if they're nearby\n3. Go RIGHT back to (2,2) if needed for positioning\n4. Set up a trapping maneuver to box the enemy in on the left side\n\nI'm keeping my lead and playing SMART! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 LEFT",

Actually, looking at the map, (1,1) is marked as \"A\" - yes, it's an apple! \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nChat, here's the tactical situation! The enemy is RIGHT above me at (1,3). We're in a PERFECT counter position - I can go LEFT to (0,2) or DOWN to (1,1).\n\n**Option A: LEFT to (0,2)** - Safe, but puts me on the LEFT EDGE. That's a DEATH TRAP!

No collision risk.\n3. **POSITIONING:** After eating, I'll be at (1,1) with body at [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2)]. The enemy is still at (1,3) - above me but not threatening directly.\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (1,1), I can go DOWN to (1,0), LEFT to (0,1), or RIGHT to (2,1). Many options!\n5. **EDGE AVOIDANCE:** Going LEFT to (0,2) would trap me on the left edge - terrible idea!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1):\n1. I'll be length 4, enemy length 2 - I have MASSIVE lead!\n2. From (1,1), I can dominate the bottom-left corner\n3. Watch enemy's move - if they go DOWN to (1,2), I can go LEFT to (0,1) or RIGHT to (2,1)\n4. Keep the pressure on - don't let them breathe!\n5.

Let's break this down LIVE!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head at (1,1), body at [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2)] - length 4\n- Enemy head at (0,3), body at [(1,3)] - length 2\n- I'm at (1,1) with an apple right next to me at (0,1)!\n- Board has apples everywhere - time to hunt!\n\n**ELIMINATION PROCESS:**\n1. **UP to (1,2):** That's my CURRENT body segment! Moving into myself = instant death. \u274c ELIMINATED!\n2. **DOWN to (1,0):** Row 0 shows (1,0) is \".\" (empty). Safe to move there! \u2705\n3. **LEFT to (0,1):** Column 0 shows (0,1) is \"A\" (APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e). Safe to move there! I'd EAT the apple and grow to length 5, leading 4-1! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (2,1):** Column 2 shows (2,1) is \".\" (empty). Safe to move there! \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nChat, here's the tactical situation! The enemy is TOTALLY BOXED IN at (0,3) with his tail at (1,3) - he's trapped on the left edge! From his position, he can only move RIGHT to (1,3) (which would be moving into his own tail) or UP/DOWN along the edge. He's basically dead in 2-3 turns if we play this right!\n\n**Option A: LEFT to (0,1)** - This is an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e I'd GROW to length 5 and lead 4-1! This is AGGRESSIVE PLAY! I eat the apple AND push into the left corner where the enemy is trapped. From (0,1), I can see his entire trap.\n\n**Option B: DOWN to (1,0)** - Safe but no apple. Opens up the bottom edge for movement.\n\n**Option C: RIGHT to (2,1)** - Safe but no apple. Moves me AWAY from the trapped enemy. Not ideal for aggression!\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI'm going with **LEFT to (0,1)**! Here's why:\n1. **SCORE LEAD:** I eat the apple, grow to length 5, and lead 4-1! Massive advantage!\n2. **POSITIONING:** From (0,1), I can see the ENTIRE left side where the enemy is trapped. I can potentially cut off his escape routes.\n3. **PRESSURE:** Moving into his \"territory\" while he's trapped psychological warfare! \ud83d\ude08\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (0,1), I can go UP to (0,2), DOWN to (0,0), or RIGHT to (1,1). Many options!\n5. **TRAP REINFORCEMENT:** By positioning myself at (0,1), I'm literally blocking ONE of his potential escape routes already!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter eating the apple at (0,1):\n1. I'll be length 5, enemy length 2 - ABSOLUTE DOMINANCE!\n2. Watch the enemy's move - he's trapped and probably panicking\n3. If he goes RIGHT to (1,3), I can go UP to (0,2) to cut him off further\n4. Keep tightening the noose - force him to crash into his own tail or my body\n5. Look for more apples while ensuring he has ZERO escape routes\n\nI'm getting that apple and putting this game in a chokehold! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 LEFT",

Quick brain-dump and then we MOVE.\n\nQuick 4-way check from our head (0,3):\n- LEFT -> (-1,3): OFF BOARD = DEATH. Never that. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (1,3): our neck \u2014 moving BACKWARDS into ourselves = DEATH. \u274c\n- UP -> (0,4): legal, safe, keeps options open. \ud83d\udc4d\n- DOWN -> (0,2): legal, aggressive, moves toward the opponent's zone. \u2705\n\nEnemy (Head at 1,1) legal options this turn: LEFT \u2192 (0,1), RIGHT \u2192 (2,1), DOWN \u2192 (1,0). They cannot go UP into (1,2) because that's their body. They have apple advantage (3 vs 1) \u2014 so we AVOID any risky simultaneous head-on trades. We want to corral and reduce their safe space.\n\nWhy DOWN is best:\n- It inches us toward their left flank and starts to shrink their escape corridor along the left wall.\n- It keeps two follow-up options next turn (UP to recover or further DOWN toward (0,1) if safe), so we\u2019re not trapped immediately.\n- UP is safe but passive \u2014 gives them room to roam and pick apples. We need to be the bully and start limiting them now. \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort-term plan (for the next couple turns):\n- Move DOWN to (0,2) now to begin cutting off their left-side space.\n- If they respond by going LEFT to (0,1), pivot to trap (pressure from above/below) and try to shepherd them into the bottom edge or a corner where you can force mistakes.\n- Avoid any head-to-head unless we gain apple parity/lead; instead, slowly constrain their movement and force them into collisions with walls or their own body.\n\nTime to lock it in \u2014 let\u2019s tighten the noose.

But wait\u2014let me check the board state carefully... \ud83e\udd14\n\n**SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n- My head at (0,1) - I just moved LEFT last turn and ate that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- My body: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2)] - length 4\n- Enemy at (0,2) with tail at (0,3) - he's STILL trapped on the left edge!\n- I'm positioned PERFECTLY to cut off his escape routes!\n\n**MOVE CONSIDERATIONS:**\n1. **UP to (0,2):** OH NO! Enemy head is THERE right now! If I move up and he moves down... HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83d\udc80 Both snakes die! But wait, with my length 4 vs his length 2, I'd WIN the tie-breaker (3-1 lead)! That's actually AGGRESSIVE PLAY! \n2. **DOWN to (0,0):** That's just empty space. Safe but passive.\n3. **RIGHT to (1,1):** That's my CURRENT body segment! Moving into myself = instant death! \u274c\n4. **LEFT:** Off the board! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**THE CRITICAL DECISION:**\nChat, this is a BRAIN MOVE! The enemy is trapped at (0,2) with his tail at (0,3). His only escape is DOWN to (0,1)... but that's where I WAS last turn! If he moves down, he'd run into my tail! He's literally boxed in!\n\nIf I go **UP to (0,2)**:\n- He might go DOWN to (0,1) \u2192 he hits my tail \u2192 he dies! I WIN!\n- He might go RIGHT to (1,2) \u2192 that's my body! \u2192 he dies! I WIN!\n- He might stay (can't) or go UP (off board) \u2192 he dies! I WIN!\n- Only if he goes LEFT (impossible) or we both go UP \u2192 DOUBLE DEATH but I win tie-breaker!\n\n**THIS IS A CHECKMATE SITUATION!** \ud83d\udc80\n\nI'm going for the KILL SHOT! **UP to (0,2)** to force the confrontation! Even if we collide, I win the tie-breaker 3-1! But more likely, he tries to escape down and hits my tail, or right and hits my body!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter this move, the enemy will be DEAD or I'll have reinforced my dominance. Then I can start farming apples in the center while plotting my next hunt! 30 apples or bust!\n\nLET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

They CANNOT move LEFT (off board) or RIGHT (1,1 is their body). So they only have two options. Important: we\u2019re behind on apples (1 vs 3) so we do NOT want a mutual suicide into the same cell. Fortunately, moving DOWN into their head cannot produce a same-cell head-on from their side \u2014 the outcomes are either a swap (they go UP into our current cell) or they go DOWN to (0,0). Neither is a simultaneous same-cell collision given their legal options. So although we should generally avoid head fights, we have NO other safe move \u2014 DOWN is forced and survivable.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN to (0,1) now to deny the left column and force them to commit DOWN to the bottom or swap positions.\n- If they drop to (0,0), immediately aim to pressure them along the bottom edge and cut off their escape to the right \u2014 corralling into a corner is the goal. If they swap, use the new relative positions to cut off their mobility and force them into their body or the wall.\n- Avoid any head-on trades until we close the apple gap; use board control to herd them into a mistake. Stay aggressive and keep options open for turns 9\u201311.\n\nLOCKING IT IN \u2014 we have only one safe move here: go DOWN.\n\nDOWN",
