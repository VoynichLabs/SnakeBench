Grabbing (4,5) is a fast way to start piling apples and enable head-pressure later. Also we want to keep multiple escape options open.\n\nEliminate bad choices:  \n- LEFT and DOWN move away from the most immediate apple opportunities and don't increase pressure.  \n- UP is decent (toward (2,8)), but takes us off the row with the quick (4,5) apple and slightly reduces our immediate pressure on center.  \n- RIGHT moves us toward (4,5) and keeps options open (we can continue right/up/down next turn).\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):  \n1) Move RIGHT to (3,5) now, then aim to (4,5) to pick that apple ASAP. \ud83c\udf4e  \n2) After grabbing (4,5), push toward (5,7)/(6,6)/(6,4) cluster depending on the opponent\u2019s choices \u2014 prioritizing apples while cutting their shortest routes.  \n3) Once we have a lead, bait them into head-on or into tighter spaces by boxing them toward the right edge while we control center.

Prioritize staying one step away from a mutual-head cell to avoid accidental double-KO.\n- Use growth opportunistically to block lanes; if they overcommit, force them into a head-on only when we\u2019re +apples.\n\nAlright \u2014 time to press.

That\u2019s textbook forcing play when you have the lead.\n- UP keeps more follow-up options (UP/LEFT/RIGHT) and avoids hugging walls or dropping back from the fight.\n- DOWN would be safer for the apple at (6,4) but lets the opponent breathe and avoid conflict. RIGHT is unnecessarily committing to the wall.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 this will be our \u201clast rationale\u201d next clip):\n- Move UP to (7,6), maintain lateral options.\n- Next turn, threaten/contest (6,6). If the opponent commits, force a head-on into that apple and take the win (we\u2019re up on apples).\n- If they avoid the fight, keep pressing vertically and trim their escape routes \u2014 box them toward the top-left corridor and force mistakes.\n\nTime to pressure the rival and make them choke \u2014 LET\u2019S GO!\n\nUP",

Perfectly legal play.  \n- Even if they don\u2019t take the bait, LEFT gets us an apple to go up to 4 and immediately increases our lead while also cutting off their right-side options.  \n- UP or RIGHT are safer but less aggressive; they give the opponent room to run and might waste our advantage.\n\nShort-term plan (what I want next turns \u2014 this will be the \"last rationale\" on the next clip):  \n- Move LEFT to (5,7) now to contest the apple and either force a head-on (win) or take the apple ourselves (grow to 4).  \n- Next turns: if opponent retreats (LEFT/DOWN), press and shrink their space \u2014 prioritize cutting exits and continuing to contest apples on their flank.

RIGHT is safe too, but lets them contest the top. LEFT is a dirty KO-tactic but unnecessary when we can just secure the apple and then press.

Their plausible moves: LEFT (1,8), UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7). They cannot contest (4,9) or (6,9) this turn.

RIGHT is safer and more controlling.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat at (6,9) now, then take (6,8) next turn to grow and cement lead.

Eating = +1 apple and growth, but it will temporarily restrict our follow-ups (after eating the only safe non-backwards move will be RIGHT).\n\nEnemy read \u2014 what can #1 do?\n- Their head at (1,8) with neck at (2,8) means they cannot go RIGHT. They can go LEFT (0,8), UP (1,9) or DOWN (1,7). They\u2019re far on the left; no immediate head-on threat this turn. Are they trying to dart to the top row?

Safer.\n- DOWN grabs the apple at (6,8) now, growing us to widen the lead (we\u2019re already up 6\u21923). BUT eating forces our hand next turn \u2014 @ (6,8) our only safe follow-up will be RIGHT (7,8). That\u2019s acceptable aggression: we eat, then pivot rightwards and start hemming them in from above. More apples = bigger edge; we want to snowball this lead and be able to accept a head-on later.\n\nStream mentality: we\u2019re ahead on apples, we should be greedy but not reckless. Eating now gives us +1 content and more threat value, even if it narrows our immediate choices. The opponent is too far to force a collision, so taking the apple and then capitalizing on movement to the right/top to box lanes is high-value.\n\nShort-term plan (for next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Take the apple at (6,8) this turn (grow), then move RIGHT next turn into (7,8) to open space and avoid self-collision. From there, keep pressuring the top corridor, collect more apples along the top/right flank, and begin hemming the opponent leftwards. If they try to head-on while we\u2019re bigger, we accept the favorable trade.\n\nLet\u2019s be brutal and greedy \u2014 we EAT.\n\nDOWN",

Slightly fewer follow-ups than DOWN, but the growth and board control are worth it given enemy is isolated.\n- DOWN keeps max mobility, but passes up a free apple and the chance to snowball our lead.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Eat the apple now (LEFT), then pivot toward center (6\u20137 x-range) to slowly shrink the playable area and herd the enemy. Keep body spacing to avoid self-boxing.\n- If enemy drifts up/center later, bait a head-on once we have clear confinement and superior size.

Only force head-on if we can guarantee they die (i.e., we have the apple advantage or a trap).\n- Keep an eye on their moves to see if they try to escape right/up; if they commit deeper to the left/bottom, tighten the noose.\n\nLET'S BOX THIS FOOL IN \u2014 safe, flexible, aggressive playstyle.

Time to think like a predator: be aggressive, deny apples, and keep escape routes open.\n\nQuick legal-move sweep:\n- LEFT -> (5,4) is the neck. Illegal. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- UP -> (6,5) is an apple and is FREE. Safe and gives options to hit (7,5) next. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (6,3) is an apple and is FREE. Safe and pushes toward the apple cluster around y=3. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (7,4) is an apple and FREE. Safe, gets us deeper into the mid-right corridor and opens many follow-ups (7,5),(8,4),(7,3). \u2705\n\nRisk check: Opponent head is at (4,2) \u2014 they cannot reach any of our candidate squares this turn, so no immediate head-on threat. Good. We should NOT force a head-on (we\u2019re behind on apples), so keep options and deny them apples.\n\nTactical read / move comparison:\n- UP (6,5): ties the apples +1, gives access to (7,5) and keeps us near center vertically. Solid.\n- DOWN (6,3): ties apples +1 and heads toward the low-apple cluster (8,3). Good for chasing apples downwards.\n- RIGHT (7,4): ties apples +1 and shifts us right to control mid-right space \u2014 this best helps us corral the board, gives multiple safe continuations (UP to 7,5, DOWN to 7,3, RIGHT to 8,4/8,3) and starts hemming the enemy toward x <= 4. Most aggressive for boxing them in without risking head-on.\n\nLong-term plan (next 2\u20136 turns):\n- Grab (7,4) now to immediately increase board control on the right.\n- Follow up to (7,5) or (7,3)/(8,3) depending on where apples and enemy move.\n- Use our extra length to lock the mid-right corridor (x >= 6\u20137), hemming the opponent left. Avoid any head-on unless we flip the apple lead.\n- Keep at least 2 escape directions each turn \u2014 no dead-ending along the wall.\n\nLET\u2019S MAKE THE MOVE AND START THE PRESSURE! \u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

We want an apple to close the gap and keep mobility.\n\nWhy UP: Eating (7,5) ties the apples (12\u201312), gives immediate growth (so we don\u2019t lose body length mid-fight), and opens multiple safe follow-ups: (7,6), (6,5) (another apple), or swing right to (8,5).

From there push to (6,5) or (7,6) to keep options and keep the opponent left-of-center.  \n- Deny apples they can reach; stay 2+ escape routes open each turn. No risky head-on until we lead on apples.  \n- Use length to wall off x>=6\u20137 and force them into tighter space toward the left/top where we can trap.\n\nLet\u2019s eat and keep the pressure high.

That switches us to the aggressor role (we should force head-ons only when we lead).  \n- Safety: Opponent head at (6,2) cannot reach (6,5) this turn, so no simultaneous head-on risk. The square is unoccupied by any body.  \n- Mobility after eating: from (6,5) we still have at least two decent follow-ups (6,6 or 5,5) \u2014 we won\u2019t be boxed in immediately. We do NOT walk into our own body or backwards.  \n- Strategic value: taking that apple both denies the opponent and lets us start pressuring them\u2014now we can look to corral them toward their left/top and, with the lead, capitalize on a risky head-on if it\u2019s advantageous later.\n\nShort plan (next 2\u20136 turns):\n- Eat (6,5) now. From there push to safe high ground (6,6) or swing left to 5,5 to hem them in.  \n- Deny apples they can realistically reach while maintaining 2+ escape routes each move.  \n- Once leading, play more aggressively: tighten lanes and look for a clean head-on if they try to squeeze past our body.\n\nTime to eat and take the initiative.

They only can go LEFT to (5,0) or RIGHT to (7,0). No immediate head-to-head threat on any of our three legal moves this turn. They\u2019ll jockey left/right under our y=4 wall.\n\nWhy I pick UP (6,7) \u2014 short and lethal:\n- Maximizes mobility (3 solid follow-ups). We want many options to react to their left/right wiggle under our wall.  \n- Preserves ability to pivot left or right next turn to start a closing sweep without getting funneled into our own body.  \n- Avoids the slightly riskier tight corridor at (7,6). We\u2019re down one apple \u2014 don\u2019t force a head-on. We want to corral, not suicide.  \n- Keeps pressure from above so we can start compressing vertical space and then swing left to block their escapes through x0/x1 if they try to loop. \ud83d\udc40\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20136 turns):\n- Hold high ground (rows 6\u20138) while watching opponent\u2019s lateral moves on row 0\u20133.  \n- If they drift right toward open space, pivot right to cut them off but only if we maintain more options. If they hug left, swing left and drop a wall to seal the column path.  \n- Avoid a head-on unless we get ahead on apples. Force them into the bottom corner and finish when they run out of moves or walk into our body. \ud83e\udea4\n\nLet\u2019s keep that pressure, stay alive, and make them regret stepping in our lane.

No head-on risk.  \n- Eating gives us growth and more body to seal lanes; after the apple we can pivot to either cut their left escape or shove them to the right corner depending on their moves.  \n- Keeps multiple follow-up options (we can go up/left next turn to continue sealing or circle back to pressure).\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Turn 1 (now): TAKE (5,8) to tie.  \n- Turn 2: Assess opponent \u2014 if they go right, they\u2019ll head toward (9,0) and be further isolated; pivot LEFT/up to start hemming them in. If they try to sneak left, start closing the gap on x<=1 exit.  \n- Avoid head-on unless we hold the apple lead. Force them into the bottom corners behind our y=4 wall and finish them into a collision with our body.\n\nLet\u2019s eat, tie it up, and start the squeeze.

No immediate collisions or traps visible.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Eat the (4,9) apple now. Sweep left across the top row to pick (2,9) and (1,9) while maintaining room to drop down at x\u22483\u20134 when we want to hem the opponent in.\n- Stay flexible: avoid committing to a head-on unless we overtake them in apples or can guarantee they crash first.\n- Use our length and the y=4 wall area to fold down later and seal exits when the opponent is forced upward.\n\nLET\u2019S GO \u2014 EAT THAT TOP APPLE AND PRESSURE.

Quick breakdown, then we pounce.\n\nQuick move scan:\n- UP -> (4,10): off-board = immediate death. No.\n- RIGHT -> (5,9): INTO OUR NECK (backwards). Illegal. Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- DOWN -> (4,8): legal, open, gives room but pulls us away from top apples.\n- LEFT -> (3,9): legal, safe, keeps pressure on the top row apples at (2,9) and (1,9).\n\nEnemy head at (9,2) can only go UP to (9,3) (apple) or LEFT to (8,2). They\u2019re two apples ahead \u2014 we do NOT want a head-on collision unless we overtake them. Their moves are far from our head this turn, so no immediate head-on threat.\n\nDecision: go LEFT. Why?\n- Immediate safety: LEFT is legal and not running into any body. DOWN is safe too, but LEFT is superior for score and control.\n- Aggression & apples: LEFT keeps us on the top row to pick up (2,9) and (1,9) quickly \u2014 we need to close the 2-apple deficit.\n- Space control: sweeping left along y=9 preserves multiple follow-up options (continue left to apples, or drop down later around x\u22483\u20134 to start hemming the opponent). It avoids committing to a cramped corridor near our own middle-body cluster.\n- Risk management: opponent is far; we avoid any risky head-on because we don\u2019t yet have the apple lead.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Sweep left to (2,9) then (1,9) to grab apples and tie/overtake.\n- After securing top apples, pivot down near x\u22483\u20134 to begin folding toward the opponent\u2019s approach lanes, using our length to box and force mistakes.\n- Never move into potential simultaneous head cell with opponent unless we\u2019ve got the apple advantage.\n\nLET\u2019S GET THESE APPLES \u2014 keep it tight, keep it ruthless.

Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,7): legal but hugs the wall and reduces exits \u2014 bad for mid/late-game mobility.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,6): legal and safe, but no apple and doesn\u2019t close the gap to the leader.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,7): legal AND there\u2019s an apple at (2,7). Eats to tie the score (19-19), grows us, and keeps multiple follow-up choices (2,8 / 3,7 / 2,6). Opponent head is at (8,6) \u2014 too far to cause any immediate head-on. No collision risk this turn.\n\nDecision: take the apple and get aggressive. We\u2019re trailing by one \u2014 grabbing (2,7) ties it and gives us length to start cutting them off. We want to chain apples across y=7 (2,7 \u2192 3,7 \u2192 4,7) to snowball, then pivot to pressure their flank while always keeping an escape corridor. Only force a head-on when we\u2019re ahead on apples or can guarantee they hit our body. Play smart, keep options open, bully the map.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Eat (2,7) now to tie score.\n- Aim for (3,7) and (4,7) next to get ahead.\n- After chaining, shift toward center/right to hem their movement and threaten a head-on once we\u2019re leading.\n- Never run into our own neck/walls \u2014 maintain a 2+ option buffer.\n\nRIGHT",

My head is perched at (9,7) \u2013 the edge of the map, but I still have three potential exits: UP, DOWN, and LEFT? Wait LEFT is a death trap because it\u2019s my own tail. So only UP and DOWN survive the instant\u2011kill test. Which path offers more breathing room and apple potential? UP pushes me toward the coveted (9,9) apple and leaves me with two viable follow\u2011ups (UP or LEFT). DOWN grabs the (9,6) apple now but shackles me to a single downward corridor. I want to stay flexible, keep options open, and avoid getting boxed in. Also, staying on the right side keeps me away from snake #0\u2019s column. So the smart play is to go UP, chase the top\u2011right apple, and keep multiple escape routes.\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f LONG\u2011TERM PLAN: \ud83d\ude80 Keep climbing to (9,9) for that sweet apple, then swing left to (8,8) to widen the lead, and stay alert for any head\u2011on collisions with snake #0. Growth = domination!\n\nUP",

Dead move. \u274c\n\nLegal options:\n- UP \u2192 (3,8): safe, keeps options but passes on apples. OK.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,6): safe, open space but passive.

Eating this gives us the lead (21\u201320) and increases our length \u2014 perfect for applying pressure.\n\nOpponent head (9,7) has neck at (8,7) so they cannot move LEFT into us this turn; they can go UP or DOWN but they're far \u2014 no immediate head-on threat if we take the apple.\n\nWhy RIGHT is best:\n- Immediate apple pickup to take the lead and grow \u2014 now we can force tempo.\n- After (4,7) we still have multiple follow-ups (UP/DOWN/RIGHT), so we won\u2019t get boxed in immediately.\n- With the lead, we can start corralling toward the opponent\u2019s x=8 corridor and bait them into risky moves or a head-on when advantageous.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Eat at (4,7) now.\n- Push right/center (toward 5,7 then up/down as needed) to control lanes and shrink their safe space.\n- Maintain 2+ escape routes; only force head-on when we\u2019re clearly ahead or can bait them into our body.\n\nRIGHT",

No joke, we don\u2019t do that. \u274c\n\nCheck moves:\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,7): illegal (backwards).\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,7): legal, aggressive, moves us toward center/contest lanes\u2026 but HUGE caveat: from (5,7) our immediate follow-ups are almost blocked by our own body (5,8 and 6,7 are occupied), leaving only a narrow escape (likely DOWN). That\u2019s how players get boxed in. Not worth reducing options to 1. \ud83e\udd0f\ud83e\udea4\n- UP \u2192 (4,8): legal but also pretty constrained next turn (UP is into our body at 4,9; RIGHT is blocked by 5,8; DOWN is backwards). Only LEFT to (3,8) gives a route \u2014 so still a tight corridor. Meh. \ud83d\ude2c\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,6): legal and clean \u2014 gives multiple safe follow-ups (LEFT 3,6, RIGHT 5,6, DOWN 4,5). Keeps our mobility high, avoids committing into our own body, and preserves options to chase or box later. That\u2019s the play. \u2705\n\nOpponent head is at (9,8) with neck at (9,7) \u2014 they can\u2019t immediately threaten a head-on with us this turn. No rush to suicidal contact; force them into tight spaces later when we\u2019re ready.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Drop DOWN now to maximize escape routes and maintain board control.\n- From there, pivot left/right to control the mid-lane and slowly compress the opponent\u2019s safe area toward the x=8\u20139 corridor.\n- Only force a head-on when we have a clear apples advantage or can bait them into colliding with our body. For now, keep mobility and grow opportunistically.\n\nYou heard me \u2014 stay slick, keep options, pressure, then pounce. Ready for the choke? Let\u2019s make him run into us. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

If we go UP we have zero safe follow-ups next turn \u2192 virtual suicide. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5) is free and alive. It leaves at least one follow-up (LEFT to 4,5) and doesn\u2019t trap us immediately. \u2705\n\nOpponent head (8,9) cannot go RIGHT (back into 9,9) or UP (off board). They\u2019ll pick LEFT\u2192(7,9) to chase apples or DOWN\u2192(8,8). Neither threatens us this turn.\n\nDecision reasoning \u2014 be aggressive but alive:\n- UP is flashy but instant-box trap \u2014 don\u2019t be that guy. \ud83d\ude2c\n- RIGHT/LEFT are illegal.\n- DOWN is the only safe, non-suicidal move that preserves at least one escape and keeps pressure on the board. We can follow LEFT next to start squeezing the opponent\u2019s right/top corridor, or pivot depending on their movement. Stay alive, then force mistakes. \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to avoid the pocket.\n- Next turn go LEFT to (4,5) to reclaim space and threaten the right/top corridor.\n- If opponent commits to the top edge (7\u20139), compress their escape routes and force a head-on only if we\u2019re ahead or they blunder.

Conservative but not getting the immediate apple.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,5) is empty and legal. From (4,5) we have LEFT\u2192(3,5) apple next turn plus a safe fallback down to (4,4). UP is blocked by our body at (4,6) but we still retain two safe follow-ups.\n\nOpponent (7,9) can only go LEFT to (6,9) (there\u2019s an apple there) or DOWN to (7,8).

Why?\n- Aggressive and pragmatic: it sets up an immediate apple at (3,5) next turn to tie the score, without cornering ourselves.\n- Keeps multiple follow-ups (LEFT to apple or DOWN to 4,4), avoids the small pocket risk that UP earlier would\u2019ve created.\n- No head-on risk from the opponent this turn; we\u2019re not forcing a collision while behind on apples.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (4,5).\n- Next turn take the apple at (3,5) to even the score (22\u201322) if it\u2019s uncontested.\n- After eating, pivot to compress the opponent\u2019s right/top corridor when safe \u2014 but only force head-on if we hold the apple lead or they blunder.

Quick legal sweep from our head at (3,5):\n\n- Illegal: RIGHT \u2192 (4,5) is our neck (can\u2019t go backwards).  \n- Legal: UP \u2192 (3,6), DOWN \u2192 (3,4), LEFT \u2192 (2,5).\n\nKey read on the rival (head at 7,7, neck at 7,8): they cannot go UP (that\u2019s their neck), and RIGHT (8,7) is their own body, LEFT (6,7) is our body \u2014 so their only legal move this turn is DOWN to (7,6). That means they\u2019re about to walk into a tiny pocket where every exit next turn is blocked by bodies (our body at 6,6 and 7,5, and their own body at 8,6). Translation: they\u2019re forced into a choke point and WILL be in a losing position next turn unless something weird happens.\n\nOur priorities this turn:\n- Don\u2019t suicide into them. We must avoid any move that results in a head-on or gives them a safe escape cell next turn.\n- Preserve our blocking cells so they have no legal escape on their following move.\n- Stay aggressive and keep options open to finish the trap.\n\nWhy UP (3,6)?  \n- It\u2019s safe (not occupied).  \n- It keeps us distant from their immediate path so we won\u2019t accidentally create a head-on.  \n- We won\u2019t eat an apple (so tail moves, but the freed cell is (6,4) \u2014 irrelevant to the choke) \u2014 we maintain the critical blocks at 6,6 and 7,5 that guarantee their entrapment.  \n- It\u2019s the most aggressive of the safe moves: nudges us closer vertically to pressure and keeps multiple follow-ups open (LEFT/DOWN next turn to tighten if needed).\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Force them DOWN into (7,6) this turn. Next turn they\u2019ll have to move into one of our body segments and die. Don\u2019t take the cell they might be forced into \u2014 let them crash. If they somehow try a double-KO, only take it if we\u2019re winning by apples (we\u2019re tied now, so avoid that).\n- After they perish, clean up apples and secure the board, then use our body to box remaining space and hit 30.\n\nWe\u2019re about to watch them walk into our trap. Let\u2019s finish this \u2014 ruthless but clean. Do we want blood? You bet. Do we want to survive? Absolutely. Let\u2019s move.\n\nUP",

Time to be surgical and not throw the game.\n\nQuick legal sweep from our head at (3,6):\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,5) is our neck = immediate backstep = suicide. OUT.\n- UP \u2192 (3,7) is occupied by our own body. OUT.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,6) is occupied by our own body. OUT.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,6) is the only legal move and it\u2019s unoccupied. SAFE.\n\nOpponent check (head at 7,6, neck at 7,7): they literally have no safe non-self-colliding escape \u2014 their UP is their neck (illegal), RIGHT and many exits are blocked by their own body or our body at (6,6) and (7,5). Let them walk into the choke. Do NOT take any cell that causes a head-on or double-KO \u2014 we\u2019re tied, so avoid mutual death.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move LEFT to (2,6) \u2014 forced and safe.\n- Next turn: watch them get boxed into their body; do not move into their forced head cell. If they somehow try a head-on, only accept it if we\u2019re winning on apples (we\u2019re tied now, so avoid).\n- After they die, sweep apples and close the map to 30.\n\nWe keep it ruthless but smart. No risky grabs. LEFT",
