Moving left from (2,0) takes us to (1,0). Let's verify if moving LEFT is safe:\n\n- Moving left to (1,0): within bounds, no obstacle there, and not the snake body (since our body is at (3,0)). Safe.\n\nOther options from (2,0):\n\n- UP: to (2,1): check if safe. No obstacle or wall, safe.\n- RIGHT: to (3,0): which currently holds our body position? Our body is at (3,0), so moving RIGHT would lead onto our body if the snake length increases there. Since our snake is of length 1 now, moving onto (3,0) would be moving onto our own body, which is death.\n\n- DOWN: to (2,-1): outside bounds, invalid.\n\nSo moving LEFT or UP from current position are both safe options.\n\nHowever, we've thought about moving LEFT previously favorably because it leads to the apple at (1,0). The apple at (1,0) is close, and moving there would be safe.\n\nNext, after reaching (1,0), what are the options?\n\nFrom (1,0), options:\n\n- UP: to (1,1)\n- LEFT: to (0,0)\n- RIGHT: to (2,0) (our previous position)\n- DOWN: outside bounds.\n\nMoving UP from (1,0) to (1,1): safe if unoccupied, no obstacles.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,0): also safe.\n\nIf I proceed to go LEFT to (0,0), I risk trapping myself near the boundary, but it's safe; then I can head toward other apples later.\n\nAlternatively, going UP might lead to a better position to pursue larger apples like (5,3).\n\nSince our current priority is to get the closest apple, moving LEFT from (2,0) to (1,0), then possibly UP, we can start heading toward the nearby apple at (2,2).\n\nAlternatively, considering the current positions:\n\n- Moving UP from (2,0) to (2,1): safe, will move closer to (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,1), moving UP to (2,2): lands on apple, growing our length, which is good.\n\nThus, a path plan:\n\n1. From (2,0), move UP to (2,1).\n2. From (2,1), move UP to (2,2): eat apple, grow.\n3. Then, head towards other apples, such as (3,9) or (5,6), planning a safe route.\n\nConsidering safety:\n\n- Moving UP is safe; no obstacles.\n- Moving to the right after that is to progress toward other apples.\n- From the current position at (2,0), moving UP seems promising.\n\nGiven that, I will prioritize moving UP now.\n\nNext move:\n\n- From current position (2,0), move UP to (2,1).\n\nThus, my decision: **UP**."
