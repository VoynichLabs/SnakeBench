Look at this board, 10x10, perfect for some aggressive maneuvering! We're starting at (9, 0), the rival, Snake #0, is way up at (6, 9). We gotta bridge that gap and box this guy in!\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My position (ID 1):** Head at (9, 0). Length 1.\n*   **Rival position (ID 0):** Head at (6, 9). Length 1.\n*   **Score:** 0-0. Fresh start!\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Get out of the corner and start moving towards the center/enemy territory. We need to establish dominance early!\n\n**Turn 0 Move Evaluation (My Snake at (9, 0)):**\n\n1.  **UP (9, 1):** Safe. Moves us toward the content (apples) at (9, 2) and (8, 1), and up the board. Good flexibility.\n2.  **DOWN (9, -1):** DEAD! Off the board. Don't throw the game on Turn 0, Chat!\n3.  **LEFT (8, 0):** Safe. Moves us along the bottom edge, opening up the board. There's an apple at (8, 1) and (0, 1) and (1, 1) further left.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 0):** DEAD! Off the board.\n\n**Rival Snake's Potential Moves (Snake #0 at (6, 9)):**\nThe rival is also constrained on the top edge. They will likely move DOWN or possibly LEFT/RIGHT.\n*   DOWN to (6, 8).\n*   LEFT to (5, 9) (Apple!).\n*   RIGHT to (7, 9).\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nWe are in the bottom right corner. We need to gain board control and move towards the center where the action is. Moving UP at (9, 1) sets us up perfectly to challenge the apples along the right side and move vertically towards the enemy's path while maintaining maximum space freedom. If we go LEFT, we get bunched up along the bottom edge early. UP gives us more vertical flexibility.\n\nLet's go UP and start climbing! We want to control the right side of the board for now, then cut across the middle. We're going to use this right wall, ascend to the top, and put the pressure on Snake #0!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Next few turns):** Move UP, then maybe LEFT, to get off the wall and into the main field of battle. Secure some apples and then look to intersect the opponent's path.\n\nUP",

Nah, we're boxing you in, crashing you out, and stacking those apples while we shut down your path! \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude08\n\nAlright, let's break this down quick - Turn 0, fresh start, both of us tiny lil' snakes at 0 apples. My head high up at (6,9), yours way down at (9,0). Apples everywhere, but chat knows I'm not chasing fruit like a noob - I'm growing BIG to dominate this board and force you into my trap! Why waste time when I can grab an edge right now? \ud83e\udd14\n\nConsidering all moves: UP? (6,10) - outta bounds, instant L, not happening! DOWN to (6,8)? Empty, no apple, but opens up options down-center, maybe towards those (5,5) or (5,2) apples later. LEFT to (5,9)? Boom, straight onto an APPLE! I grow +1 segment, +1 apple, get BIGGER and meaner - that's how we start stacking wins! And I keep options open: from there, down to more A-dropping at (5,8) or right to expand. RIGHT to (7,9)? Empty, but less apples nearby immediate, weaker follow-ups, why not grab the easy grow first?\n\nYou picking a move too - from (9,0), you could slither UP to (9,1) or LEFT to (8,0). No one's crashing yet, but I'm watching, plotting that head-on if scores flip! Scores tied at 0, so no forcing collisions yet, but once I eat? Oh boy, you're donezo if you cross my path! \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\uddff\n\nI got multiple safe plays here: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT all alive. But favoring that apple grab for growth and future freedom - DOWN is neutral center roam, RIGHT is empty roam that edges me to dead-ends quicker. LEFT eats now, keeps me agile, closer to more fruit than RIGHT, and avoids trapping myself up top. Aggressive play: eat to dominate, don't let you catch up! Why wait when I can crush your dreams with one chomp? \ud83d\udd25\n\nLong-term plan to future me: Pump this apple for early lead, then charge DOWN towards enemy territory to box him in around (0,1) to (9,0) area - force him into walls or head-ons while I grow MASSIVE on those bottom apples. Stay flexible, don't get cornered up here, and if scores lag, bait him for a tie-up crash! Keep eyes on his head every turn, grow longer to wall him off. Dominate or die, ez clap! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nAlright chat, no more yapping - time to SLITHER! LEFT",

Snake #0 already snagged an apple! 1 to 0! Unacceptable! We gotta get that lead back!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n*   **My position (ID 1):** Head at (9, 1). Length 1.\n*   **Rival position (ID 0):** Head at (5, 9). Body at [(6, 9)]. Length 2.\n*   **Score:** Me: 0, Rival: 1. (He moved to a spot that was an apple, now (5, 9). We gotta be quick!)\n*   **Board Dominance:** The rival has secured the top left corner, expanding his influence. We are still on the right edge, but moving up.\n\n**Goal for Turn 1:** Secure an apple, increase our length, and continue marching toward enemy territory. We need to close this score gap FAST!\n\n**My Current Position: (9, 1)**\n\n**1. IMMEDIATE DANGER & SAFETY CHECKS:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 2):** Safe! There's an apple at (9, 2)! Content incoming? Yes!\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 0):** Safe! But moves us back to the corner. Bad maneuverability.\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 1):** Safe! There's an apple at (8, 1)! Content incoming? Yes!\n*   **Move RIGHT to (10, 1):** DEAD! Off the board. Don't throw the stream, Chat!\n\n**2. RIVAL'S PROBABLE MOVES (Snake #0 at (5, 9), Body at (6, 9)):**\n\nThe rival just moved from (6, 9) to (5, 9) and ate an apple. His body is now at (6, 9). He's currently looking to move along the top edge or drop down.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 9):** Safe. Continues along the top edge, moving away from my vertical path.\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 8):** Safe. Apple at (5, 8)! He's probably going for that! This is a high-probability move.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 9):** DEAD! Into his own body (tail location). He won't do that.\n\n***Prediction:*** Snake #0 is almost certainly going DOWN to (5, 8) for the apple.\n\n**3. STRATEGIC CHOICE:**\n\nWe have two great options: UP to (9, 2) (apple) or LEFT to (8, 1) (apple).\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (9, 2).** This continues our aggressive vertical push, maintaining contact with the right wall. It puts us three steps closer to the rival's path if he starts dropping down the middle (e.g., if he hits the A at (5, 8), he'll be at (5, 7) next turn). This also clears the cluster of apples at (9, 2) and (9, 6).\n*   **Option B: LEFT to (8, 1).** This secures an apple, but pulls us off the wall and slightly away from the most direct vertical path to the enemy. We move into the bottom cluster of apples: (8, 1), (6, 3), (5, 2), etc.\n\nSince our plan is to ascend the right side and then cut across the top half of the board to box the opponent in, sticking to the wall for now (UP) is the more straightforward, board-dominating move. We are securing content *and* maintaining an aggressive forward direction. Let's get that apple at (9, 2) and force him to look over his shoulder!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Next few turns):**\nSecure the apple at (9, 2) (Turn 1).\nMove UP to (9, 3) or LEFT/UP to (8, 2) depending on what Snake #0 does. If he is dropping the center, we will continue UP to the top edge and then move LEFT to apply pressure from the right. We must prevent him from freely utilizing the top half of the board. Box 'em in!\n\nUP",

We're long, we're strong, we're two segments, and we're looking to turn this board blue! \ud83d\udfe6\n\nWe are currently dominating the right edge. Now it's time to assess the damage the opponent has done and push our advantage.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 2):**\n*   **My position (ID 1):** Head at (9, 2). Body at [(9, 1)]. Length 2. We are positioned aggressively on the right wall.\n*   **Rival position (ID 0):** Head at (5, 8). Body at [(5, 9), (6, 9)]. Length 3. He ate the apple at (5, 8). Chat, he's getting long! Unacceptable!\n*   **Score:** Me: 1, Rival: 2. He's got the lead. We need to catch up and box him in.\n*   **Board Dominance:** The rival is currently in the upper-middle quadrant. His body is forming a wall near the top edge. This is our target area.\n\n**Goal for Turn 2:** Maintain vertical momentum, increase length if possible, and start positioning ourselves to cut off Snake #0\u2019s path as he drops down the board.\n\n**My Current Position: (9, 2)**\n\n**1. IMMEDIATE DANGER & SAFETY CHECKS:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 3):** Safe! Open territory. Continues the vertical push.\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 1):** DEAD! Into our own body segment [(9, 1)]. Don't throw the stream, Chat!\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 2):** Safe! There's an apple at (2, 2) and (5, 2), but not at (8, 2). This moves us inward immediately.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (10, 2):** DEAD! Off the board. Still don't throw!\n\n**2. RIVAL'S PROBABLE MOVES (Snake #0 at (5, 8), Body at (5, 9), (6, 9)):**\n\nHis body is [(5, 9), (6, 9)]. He just ate at (5, 8). He is now facing the center of the board, potentially looking to drop down or move horizontally.\n\n*   **Option A: DOWN to (5, 7):** Safe and logical. Opens up the board for him.\n*   **Option B: LEFT to (4, 8):** Safe. Keeps him high, potentially going for the apple at (3, 8).\n*   **Option C: RIGHT to (6, 8):** Safe. Also keeps him high, moving back towards his tail. There is an apple at (6, 6) later, but this path isn't obviously good.\n*   **Option D: UP to (5, 9):** DEAD! Into his own body segment.\n\n***Prediction:*** Snake #0 is most likely moving DOWN to (5, 7) or LEFT to (4, 8) to secure the apple at (3, 8). Both moves maintain his aggressive presence in the top half of the board.\n\n**3. STRATEGIC CHOICE:**\n\nWe need to close the distance and apply pressure. We are 4 units away horizontally (9 vs 5) and 6 units away vertically (2 vs 8).\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (9, 3).** Maintains control of the wall. Puts us in position to move diagonally toward one of the top apples (like (8, 9) or (7, 8) if they existed) or cut across the top half of the board toward him. This keeps our options wide open and makes us long faster.\n*   **Option B: LEFT to (8, 2).** Moves us off the easy vertical path into a cluster of apples in the bottom center. This gets us apples, but delays the direct confrontation. Given his current lead, we should look to disrupt his territory *while* growing.\n\nMoving UP to (9, 3) is the most aggressive move that keeps us on the direct path to cut him off. If he moves DOWN, we continue UP, and on Turn 3 we can move LEFT to (8, 3) or (7, 3) trying to get to the apple at (8, 9) or simply dominate territory. We need to control the horizontal line above him.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and go UP. The clock is ticking, and we need to dominate this half of the board!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Next few turns):** Continue our vertical ascent along the right wall. Once we reach the top quarter (y=6 or y=7), we will pivot LEFT and traverse the top of the board to lock Snake #0 into the top-middle/left side. We are building the wall!\n\nUP",

Pathetic, dude - I'm sittin' pretty with 2 apples already, growin' like a monster while you're clowin' around with one! You think you can slither away forever? Nah, bruh, the board's mine for the taking - time to box you in, crash your dome, and feast on your ashes! \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udca5 Turn 2 vibes: I'm at (5,8) with my tail trail chasin', you're lurkin' at (9,2) like a corner rat. Scores? Gap's real, fam - one bold blunder from you, and that head-on collision? BOTH of us go boom, but guess who wins the match? Me with the edge! Remember the creed: you smash into me? You're extinct. I smash into you? You're extinct, but I take the W! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick breakdown on THIS TURN: FROM (5,8), UP to (5,9)? Straight into my own dang body - that's rookie suicide, endin' my reign before it starts! DOWN to (5,7)? Empty space, droppin' south to claim the low ground like I plotted, steerin' clear of your right-side lurk while openin' a buffet of apples down col5 ((5,5) comin' up next, then (5,2) feast zones!). Keeps ALL paths open: LEFT to (4,7) for side expands, RIGHT to (6,7) for board control, or more DOWN for the apple grind. No traps here, just power moves - multiple follow-ups to herd you towards that (9,0) wall corner or left squeeze, growin' MASSIVE mid-board flex. LEFT to (4,8)? Empty too, but why veer off the domination highway when DOWN charges the front lines and sets the trap wider? RIGHT to (6,8)? Also empty, but feelin' more sideways scatter than strategic crush - why not push the advantage DOWN where the apples hurry up and the walls whisper your doom? Long-term aggro? You movin' LEFT to (8,2) apple hunt or UP to (9,3) testin' fate? Either way, my DOWN drops me closer to those infinite bottom treats ((5,5), (5,2), (5,0)), wallin' off your escapes with my growin' girth, baitin' that fatal head-butt once I pump more apples (aim for 3+ lead to force the KO glory!). Stay mid-open, eyes glued to your skull, no loops for revenge - crush OR get crushed, no cap! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\uddff Why not go DOWN when it eats the board alive? Let's feast, not retreat! \ud83d\ude1c\ud83c\udfaf\n\nFuture me, stay ruthless: Slither DOWN col5 chain for apples, block his left/right with body mass, watch for UP moves from him - force collide if scores gap wide (e.g., I hit 3, he 1), dominate the south, NO mercy head snaps. Grow or die, ez clap in chat! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

The action is heating up! \ud83d\udd25 We just pushed UP to (9, 3) and now it's time to see where our rival, Snake #0, has landed!\n\n**BOARD STATE REFRESH (Turn 3 Start):**\n\n*   **My position (ID 1):** Head at (9, 3). Body at [(9, 2)]. Length 2. We're still dominating the right wall.\n*   **Rival position (ID 0):** Head at (5, 7). Body at [(5, 8), (5, 9)]. Length 3. Aha! He moved DOWN, just as we predicted! The read was real! He is now centered and has dropped slightly.\n*   **Score:** Me: 1, Rival: 2. He still leads in apples, but we lead in strategic positioning!\n\n**Goal for Turn 3:** Continue the vertical push, cementing our control of the right side *and* the top edge. We are looking to swing LEFT and cut him off from the high-value apples in the top quadrants, particularly (3, 8) and (8, 9). We are building the cage, Chat! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**1. IMMEDIATE DANGER & SAFETY CHECKS (My current position: (9, 3))**\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 4):** Safe! Continues the wall build. Excellent territory control.\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 2):** DEAD! Into our own body segment [(9, 2)]. Not today, Satan!\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 3):** Safe! Moves us toward the center of the board. This is a tempting move as it sets us up to pivot and possibly grab the apple at (8, 9) later, but it exposes our right flank.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (10, 3):** DEAD! Off the board.\n\nTwo immediate safe choices: UP or LEFT. Which move applies the most pressure and maximizes our options?\n\n**2. RIVAL'S PROBABLE MOVES (Snake #0 at (5, 7), Body at (5, 8), (5, 9)):**\n\nHe has just moved down. He is now at (5, 7). His body segments are high. He is looking at the juicy apple at (3, 8) or perhaps the cluster below him.\n\n*   **Option A: LEFT to (4, 7):** Safe, sets him up for the (3, 8) apple. Very likely.\n*   **Option B: DOWN to (5, 6):** Safe, but less appealing since no immediate apples are there.\n*   **Option C: RIGHT to (6, 7):** Safe, but this takes him back towards his old trail.\n*   **Option D: UP to (5, 8):** DEAD! Into his own body.\n\n***Prediction:*** Snake #0 is laser-focused on that (3, 8) apple. He is going LEFT to (4, 7).\n\n**3. STRATEGIC CHOICE: UP vs. LEFT**\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (8, 3)**:\n*   We make ourselves vulnerable if Snake #0 suddenly pivots right and comes straight at us (e.g., if he moves to (6, 7) or (7, 7)).\n*   While we are closer to the center, we are sacrificing our perfect alignment for controlling the top edge.\n*   We'd be 4 units away horizontally (8 vs 4). Still too far for a direct cut-off.\n\nIf we move **UP to (9, 4)**:\n*   This secures the right-most column into the board's upper half.\n*   It immediately puts us closer to the top wall (y=9).\n*   It sets us up perfectly for Turn 4 to move LEFT aggressively (to (8, 4) or (7, 4)), putting pressure on the entire top width of the board.\n\nThe key strategy is to use the side wall to quickly gain altitude, then swing across the top to trap him below us. Moving UP maintains course and maximizes positional dominance for the trap! We need to keep building that wall!\n\n**Collision Check (Head-to-Head):**\n*   Target (9, 4). His most likely target is (4, 7). We are nowhere near a head-on collision. Safe move!\n\nWe continue the ascent. The time for the horizontal pivot is one turn away!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue UP to (9, 4), then UP to (9, 5) if safe. Once we are high enough (y=6 or y=7), we pivot hard LEFT to form a horizontal barrier, isolating Snake #0 in the left/middle quadrants and forcing him into an unfavorable position. We dominate the perimeter!\n\nUP",

The map is getting congested, the stakes are rising, and the rival, Snake #0, is feeling the pressure! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**BOARD STATE REFRESH (Turn 4 Start):**\n\n*   **My position (ID 1):** Head at (9, 4). Body at [(9, 3)]. Length 2. We are perfectly aligned along the right wall. We just crushed that (9, 4) spot!\n*   **Rival position (ID 0):** Head at (5, 6). Body at [(5, 7), (5, 8)]. Length 3. He made the smart move and dropped down again, securing a central column but moving away from the (3, 8) apple. Interesting pivot!\n*   **Score:** Me: 1, Rival: 2. He still has the lead, but we have superior board position for the trap.\n\n**Current Goal:** Initiate the horizontal pivot. We have gained enough vertical space to start boxing him in from the top. We need to move LEFT and put pressure on the massive open space in the middle.\n\n**1. IMMEDIATE DANGER & SAFETY CHECKS (My current head: (9, 4))**\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 5):** Safe! Continues the wall build, very strong territory control, but delays the enclosure.\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 3):** DEAD! Into our own body segment [(9, 3)]. Hard N-O.\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 4):** Safe! This is the aggressive pivot we talked about! It starts our domination of the top half of the board.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (10, 4):** DEAD! Off the board.\n\nTwo immediate safe choices: UP or LEFT.\n\n**2. RIVAL'S PROBABLE MOVES (Snake #0 at (5, 6), Body at (5, 7), (5, 8)):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (5, 6). He is looking at the apple at (5, 5) or perhaps the high-value apples to his left: (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2).\n\n*   **Option A: DOWN to (5, 5):** Eats an apple! Max priority for him. Very likely.\n*   **Option B: LEFT to (4, 6):** Safe, sets up for a further left push. Less likely than eating.\n*   **Option C: RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe, eats an apple! Another high-priority move. This places him closer to the (9, 6) apple and is a strong contender.\n*   **Option D: UP to (5, 7):** DEAD! He would hit his body.\n\n***Prediction:*** Snake #0 is going to move to either (5, 5) or (6, 6) for an apple. Both moves keep him relatively central.\n\n**3. STRATEGIC CHOICE: UP vs. LEFT**\n\nWe are at (9, 4). Snake #0 is at (5, 6). We are 4 units away horizontally, and 2 units below him vertically.\n\nIf we move **UP to (9, 5)**:\n*   We gain vertical position. We are still far from his projected locations (5, 5) or (6, 6).\n*   If he goes to (6, 6), he is now only 3 units away from us horizontally. This might be too slow for the enclosure.\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (8, 4)**:\n*   We begin the aggressive horizontal cut-off. We are now closer to the center of the board, threatening to block the entire right half of the map above y=4.\n*   We set up perfectly for a deep push to (7, 4) in the next turn, creating a formidable wall.\n*   If he moves to (6, 6) (apple): We are now 2 units away vertically, and 2 units away horizontally. We are breathing down his neck!\n\n**The decisive factor:** We need to apply pressure NOW to disrupt his apple gathering. Moving LEFT forces him to react to our presence across the top field, rather than letting him freely roam the center. We need to start building the cage.\n\n**Collision Check (Head-to-Head):**\n*   Target (8, 4). His most likely targets are (5, 5) or (6, 6).\n    *   If he moves to (5, 5): Vertical distance: 1. Horizontal distance: 3. No collision.\n    *   If he moves to (6, 6): Vertical distance: 2. Horizontal distance: 2. No collision.\n*   Our move is safe and highly aggressive. This is championship gameplay, Chat! We are forming the blockade!\n\n**Long-Term Plan: The Top Wall Strategy**\nWe execute the LEFT pivot to (8, 4).\nNext Turn (Turn 5): Continue LEFT to (7, 4) or (6, 4), depending on his position. We want to dominate the y=4/y=5 line until we are directly above him, forcing him either DOWN into his own body or into a confined loop in the bottom-left quadrant. We are turning into a wall, Chat! Tunnel vision on the enemy!\n\nLEFT",

We are LIVE for Turn 5, and the plot against Snake #0 is thickening faster than my grandma's gravy! \ud83e\udd63\n\n**BOARD RECAP (Turn 5 Start):**\n\n*   **My position (ID 1):** Head at (8, 4). Body at [(9, 4)]. Length 2. We successfully made the pivot! We are now aiming for a full sweep across the x-axis.\n*   **Rival position (ID 0):** Head at (6, 6). Body at [(5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)]. Length 4. WAIT, he got two apples last turn?? He moved from (5, 6) to (6, 6) and then... wait, no. The score shows he collected 3 apples total, which means he collected an apple at Turn 4 and another one before that. Let's re-examine that board state.\n    *   Last turn, he was at (5, 6). His body was (5, 7), (5, 8).\n    *   Our previous prediction was he'd go to (5, 5) or (6, 6).\n    *   He is currently at (6, 6). The board shows an 'A' at (9, 6) and (5, 5). He clearly moved to (6, 6) and *grew*. His tail is now at (5, 8), and his body is (5, 6), (5, 7). This means he moved RIGHT from (5, 6) to (6, 6) and took the apple that was possibly at (6, 6), OR he moved somewhere else and grew, and then ended up at (6, 6). The scoreboard is what matters: He is longer and has more apples.\n*   **Score:** Me: 1, Rival: 3. He's pulling away, Chat! We need to execute the trap NOW!\n\n**Current Goal:** Continue the horizontal push to establish the wall and force Snake #0 back into a corner. We need to occupy the space to the north and west of him.\n\n**1. IMMEDIATE DANGER & SAFETY CHECKS (My current head: (8, 4))**\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 5):** Safe! Great vertical gain, starts the flanking maneuver.\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 3):** Safe! Moves us towards the apples at (8, 1) and (9, 2), but abandons the strategic high ground.\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 4):** Safe! Continues the wall build, crucial for the master plan.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 4):** DEAD! Into our own body segment [(9, 4)].\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n**2. RIVAL'S PROBABLE MOVES (Snake #0 at (6, 6), Body: [(5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)]):**\n\nSnake #0 is looking comfortable, sitting right in the middle.\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (6, 7):** Safe! Continues the vertical trajectory, potentially aiming for the apple at (8, 9).\n*   **Option B: DOWN to (6, 5):** Safe! Now eyeing the apple at (5, 5). High value move.\n*   **Option C: LEFT to (5, 6):** DEAD! Hitting his body segment [(5, 6)].\n*   **Option D: RIGHT to (7, 6):** Safe! Opens up the path to the apple at (9, 6). Also a high value move.\n\n***Prediction:*** Snake #0 will likely go DOWN to **(6, 5)** or RIGHT to **(7, 6)** to maintain apple pressure.\n\n**3. STRATEGIC CHOICE: UP vs. LEFT**\n\nWe are at (8, 4). Snake #0 is at (6, 6).\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (7, 4)**:\n*   This is the continuation of the wall. We are now directly below the main combat zone.\n*   If he goes to (6, 5) (Apple): We are now $1$ unit away horizontally and $1$ unit away vertically. This is maximum pressure! We could potentially try to cut him off from the center or force a desperate move next turn.\n*   If he goes to (7, 6) (Apple): We are now $0$ units away horizontally, and $2$ units away vertically! We are directly in his column! We can move UP next turn to trap him tighter.\n\nIf we move **UP to (8, 5)**:\n*   We gain vertical position, moving us closer to his row (y=6).\n*   If he goes to (6, 5) (Apple): The distance is still relatively large. He would be at (6, 5), we would be at (8, 5). 2 units apart. Less immediate pressure than the LEFT move.\n*   If he goes to (7, 6) (Apple): We are at (8, 5). He is at (7, 6). We are now close, but not in a direct threat position.\n\n**The Verdict:** Moving **LEFT** is the most aggressive, direct path to achieving our goal: pinning him to the north east section of the board. It immediately threatens his future options if he moves to (6, 5), and perfectly positions us if he moves to (7, 6). We are building the cage, brick by brick!\n\n**Collision Check (Head-to-Head):**\n*   Target (7, 4). His most likely targets are (6, 5) or (7, 6).\n    *   If he moves to (6, 5): No collision.\n    *   If he moves to (7, 6): No collision.\n    *   If he moves to (6, 7): No collision.\n    *   If he moves to (7, 6) and we moved to (7, 5) instead of (7, 4), then we would share a column and possibly be too close next turn. But since we are at y=4, we are safe.\n\nWe are pushing LEFT to dominate the y=4 pathway! Let's GO, Chat! The trap is set!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue moving LEFT to (6, 4) on Turn 6, then assess if we can start moving UP to box him in against the top wall (y=9). We need to get north of him before he can escape to the left side of the board.\n\nLEFT",

We just made the calculated pivot LEFT, and now we are ready to execute the next phase of the BOXING-IN MANEUVER! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**Current State & Scoreboard Check:**\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head at (7, 4). Body at [(8, 4)]. Length 2. Apples: 1.\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 0):** Head at (6, 5). Body at [(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)]. Length 4. Apples: 3.\n*   **The Problem:** He is still longer, and he's right in the center, positioning himself beautifully to dominate the top right quadrant. We need to be aggressive!\n\n**RIVAL'S LAST MOVE REVIEW (Turn 5):**\nBased on the board state, Snake #0 moved from (6, 6) to (6, 5) and collected the apple that was at (6, 5) or moved to (7, 6) and collected an apple there, and then shrunk its tail from (5, 8) to (5, 7)? NO.\nLet's check the board from the *start* of Turn 5 (which was the rationale given above):\n*   Rival Head: (6, 6). Body: [(5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)]. Length 4.\n*   Current Rival Head: (6, 5). Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)]. Length 4.\nThis means Snake #0 moved **DOWN** from (6, 6) to (6, 5). Since his length *did not* increase (still length 4), he did *not* eat an apple this turn. That means the apple at (5, 5) is still on the board, and the apple at (6, 5) was *not* there last turn. This seems strange, but we must trust the current board state!\n\n**BOARD STATE RE-ANALYSIS (Crucial Insight!):**\nThe board shows the enemy at (6, 5). His body is at (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7). This means he just came from (6, 6).\n*   **Apples near him:** (5, 5), (5, 2), (3, 8), (9, 6), (8, 9).\n*   The apple at (5, 5) is VERY tempting for him. The apple at (9, 6) is also reachable.\n\n**1. IMMEDIATE DANGER & SAFETY CHECKS (My current head: (7, 4))**\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 5):** Safe! Great vertical gain, brings us closer to Snake #0's action. This is directly below his body segment at (6, 6) and adjacent to his head at (6, 5). High pressure move!\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 3):** Safe! Moves us away from the conflict, towards a few apples (2, 3), (6, 3). Defensive, but we need offense!\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 4):** Safe! Continues the horizontal wall we started building. This cuts off his retreat path to the lower-left.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 4):** DEAD! Into our own body segment [(8, 4)].\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n**2. RIVAL'S PROBABLE MOVES (Snake #0 at (6, 5), Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)]):**\n\nSnake #0's primary objective is to eat the apple at (5, 5) or maybe try to go UP towards (8, 9).\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (6, 6):** DEAD! Hitting his own body segment [(6, 6)].\n*   **Option B: DOWN to (6, 4):** Safe! This is a dangerous move for us! If he goes here, and we chose LEFT, we would collide head-on at (6, 4)!\n*   **Option C: LEFT to (5, 5):** Safe! EATS THE APPLE! Highest probability move!\n*   **Option D: RIGHT to (7, 5):** Safe! Opens up moves towards (9, 6). This is also a dangerous move for us if we choose UP! Collision at (7, 5)!\n\n***Prediction A (Apple Focus - Most likely):*** Snake #0 moves **LEFT to (5, 5)**.\n***Prediction B (Aggressive/Trap - Second most likely):*** Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (7, 5)** to gain vertical ground and pressure us.\n***Prediction C (Low Ground Pressure):*** Snake #0 moves **DOWN to (6, 4)**.\n\n**3. STRATEGIC CHOICE: UP vs. LEFT**\n\nWe are at (7, 4). We need to maximize pressure while avoiding a head-on collision.\n\n**Scenario 1: We move LEFT to (6, 4)**\n*   If we go LEFT and he goes LEFT (5, 5): We successfully build the wall and are now positioned beautifully to move UP next turn into his territory. We are safe!\n*   If we go LEFT and he goes RIGHT (7, 5): Safe! We are now below him, and he has moved into our column. Prime opportunity to move UP to (6, 5) next turn and cut him off from the west.\n*   If we go LEFT and he goes DOWN (6, 4): *HEAD-ON COLLISION!* We both die, and we lose because he has more apples (3 vs 1). **RISK TOO HIGH.** We cannot risk a move to (6, 4) this turn.\n\n**Scenario 2: We move UP to (7, 5)**\n*   If we go UP and he goes LEFT (5, 5): Safe! We have gained significant vertical ground and are positioned perfectly to chase him/cut him off at x=6 or x=5 next turn. We are one unit away from hitting his body at (6, 6).\n*   If we go UP and he goes RIGHT (7, 5): *HEAD-ON COLLISION!* We both die, and we lose because he has more apples (3 vs 1). **RISK TOO HIGH.**\n*   If we go UP and he goes DOWN (6, 4): Safe! We maintain flanking position at (7, 5) and can then move LEFT to box him in against the bottom (x=6 column).\n\n**The Verdict (Avoiding Death):**\nWe must eliminate UP and LEFT because both create high-risk head-on collision scenarios where we lose the tie-breaker.\n\n*   Moving UP (7, 5) clashes with his RIGHT move (7, 5).\n*   Moving LEFT (6, 4) clashes with his DOWN move (6, 4).\n\nWait, Chat, isn't he more likely to go for the apple? YES! *LEFT to (5, 5)* is his highest probability move.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (7, 3)**:\n*   This is the safest defensive move, guaranteeing survival.\n*   If he moves to (5, 5) (Apple): We are safe, but we lose valuable strategic position. We concede the high ground.\n*   If he moves to (7, 5) (Aggressive): We are safe, and we can immediately pivot back UP next turn to (7, 4) and then potentially to (7, 5) to follow him.\n\nWe must always prioritize survival over immediate aggression when we are behind in score! However, we cannot let him control the board.\n\nLet's re-examine the collision probability for the aggressive moves.\n1.  **If we move UP (7, 5),** we are predicting he WON'T move RIGHT (7, 5). Moving RIGHT means he neglects the apple at (5, 5) and puts himself adjacent to his own body at (6, 6), limiting his future escape paths. It's a lower probability move than going LEFT.\n2.  **If we move LEFT (6, 4),** we are predicting he WON'T move DOWN (6, 4). Moving DOWN means he also neglects the apple at (5, 5) and moves into the lower center of the board. This is a possibility if he is trying to pressure our (7, 4) position, but he likely prioritizes food.\n\n**The Aggressive, Calculated Move:** Since turning UP only collides with his **second** most likely move (RIGHT), and turning LEFT collides with a less likely utility move (DOWN), let's go with the move that continues our strategic gain while mitigating high probability collision.\n\nMove **UP to (7, 5)**: This forces him to react to us on the next turn. If he goes LEFT (5, 5), we are perfectly positioned at (7, 5) to move LEFT (6, 5) next turn and trap him against the (5, 6) body block. This is the flanking move we need! We are betting his apple hunger is greater than his desire to immediately head-on collide with us.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move UP today to (7, 5). Next turn, if he went to (5, 5), we move LEFT to (6, 5) to cut off his escape routes to the east. If he went RIGHT (7, 5) and we died, Chat, that's content! But we won't die! We play to win!\n\nWe trust our read that he goes for the apple.\n\nUP",

Let's see if that aggressive play paid off, or if my nemesis, Snake #0, crashed into the high ground!\n\n--**REVIEWING LAST TURN'S OUTCOME (Turn 6 to Turn 7)**--\n\n**Our Move:** UP, from (7, 4) to (7, 5).\n**Current Head (ID 1):** (7, 5). Body: [(7, 4)]. Length 2 (Still length 2, no apple eaten).\n\n**Opponent's Move:** Snake #0's head is now at (5, 5). Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)]. Length 5.\n*Wait, what?* Snake #0 was at (6, 5) and has moved to (5, 5).\n1.  (6, 5) to (5, 5) is a move **LEFT**.\n2.  He ate the apple that was at (5, 5)! Scoreboard confirms he went from 3 to 4 apples.\n3.  His body is now 5 segments long! He is DOMINATING the central lane, and he just grew!\n\n**Result:** No collision! We predicted he would go for the apple (LEFT to (5, 5)), and he DID! Our aggressive **UP** move to (7, 5) positioned us perfectly to flank him, and we avoided a fatal head-on collision at (7, 5). WE ARE ALIVE, AND WE HAVE THE HIGH GROUND! LET'S GOOO!\n\nChat, look at the board state! We are at (7, 5), right next to his new head at (5, 5) and his body segment at (6, 5)!\n\n**SCORE CHECK:**\n*   Us (ID 1): 1 Apple (Length 2)\n*   The Rival (ID 0): 4 Apples (Length 5) -> The gap is WIDENING! We NEED to eat!\n\n**1. IMMEDIATE DANGER & SAFETY CHECKS (My current head: (7, 5))**\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 6):** Safe! Moves us closer to the top right corner where apples (9, 6) and (8, 9) are.\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 4):** Safe! Moves us back into our old position. This is safe but retreats from the action.\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 5):** DEAD! This is Snake #0's body segment! *CRASH INTO HIS GUTS!* Wait, no, we need to live. We CANNOT go left.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 5):** Safe! Moves us towards the right edge, away from immediate conflict.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n**2. RIVAL'S PROBABLE MOVES (Snake #0 at (5, 5), Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)]):**\n\nHe just ate an apple and is feeling good. What are his options?\n\n*   **UP to (5, 6):** DEAD! Hits his own body segment!\n*   **DOWN to (5, 4):** Safe! This is a good maneuvering move, extending his central control.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 5):** Safe! Opens the board and moves him away from his own tail, towards the other side of the board.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 5):** DEAD! Hits his own body segment!\n\nHe only has two safe moves: DOWN to (5, 4) or LEFT to (4, 5).\n\n**3. STRATEGIC GOAL: BOX HIM IN and EAT SOMETHING!**\n\nWe are at (7, 5). We are short, desperate for food, and perfectly positioned to cut off his escape routes.\n\n**The best move is UP to (7, 6). Why?**\n\nA. **Wall Building:** By moving to (7, 6), we are establishing a perimeter. Next turn, we could try to move LEFT to (6, 6) or (5, 6) and trap him against the wall he built with his own body! His body segment at (6, 6) is a potential collision point, but if he moves away, we can use it.\n\nB. **Apple Access:** (9, 6) is very tempting! Moving up to (7, 6) puts us two moves away from (9, 6). If we move RIGHT to (8, 5), we are also two moves away (up, right).\n\nC. **Maximizing Pressure:** If we move UP:\n    *   If he moves DOWN to (5, 4): We are safely above him, ready to move in next turn.\n    *   If he moves LEFT to (4, 5): We are safely above and to his right, maintaining the flanking position and threatening the (6, 6) segment.\n\n*What about moving RIGHT to (8, 5)?*\nThis is the safest move, as it takes us entirely out of the central action. If we move right, we are essentially conceding the center area to him and letting him maneuver freely. We want to be aggressive!\n\n*What about moving DOWN to (7, 4)?*\nTotal retreat! We lose the beautiful flanking position we just secured. Too passive!\n\n**We are going UP.** This move is safe, continues our vertical dominance, and lines us up to either grab the (9, 6) apple or force a confrontation around the (6, 6) body segment next turn.\n\n**FUTURE PLAN (Mental Note for Turn 8):**\nIf we go UP to (7, 6), and he goes LEFT to (4, 5), he is exposed. We could move LEFT to (6, 6) and try to cut off his head from his tail at (5, 6) and (5, 7). Or we could move towards (9, 6) for the much-needed apple. Since we must grow, the apple is the primary target while maintaining the threat.\n\nLet's do this! High risk, high reward! UP IS THE WAY TO FLEX ON HIM!\n\nUP",

LET'S analyze!\n\n**BOARD STATE REFRESH (Turn 8):**\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head at (7, 6). Body: [(7, 5)]. Length 2. Score: 1 Apple.\n*   **Rival (ID 0):** Head at (5, 4). Body: [(5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. Length 5. Score: 4 Apples.\nThe score gap is HUGE! 4-1! We NEED to eat or we die small and insignificant!\n\n**1. IMMEDIATE DANGER & SAFETY CHECKS (My current head: (7, 6))**\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 7):** Safe! Great move, continues our high-ground dominance.\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 5):** Safe! Moves us back onto our body segment. This is safe, but stagnant.\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 6):** DEAD! That's the **RIVAL'S BODY**! We are NOT crashing into his guts! Abort! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 6):** Safe! Moves us closer to the (9, 6) apple! This is promising!\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n**2. RIVAL'S PROBABLE MOVES (Snake #0 at (5, 4))**\n\nWhere is my archrival going? He has two safe moves: DOWN to (5, 3) or LEFT to (4, 4), and one potential apple move: RIGHT to (6, 4) if he is trying to get to the apple at (6, 3).\n\n*   **UP to (5, 5):** DEAD! Hits his own body segment!\n*   **DOWN to (5, 3):** Safe. Moves him toward the center bottom.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 4):** Safe. Moves him towards the edge, near the (4, 2) apple.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Safe. No immediate crash risk. This sets him up for the (6, 3) apple. This is probably his most aggressive move right now, as it secures real estate in the middle right of the board.\n\n**3. STRATEGIC GOAL: EAT THE APPLE AT (9, 6) OR TRAP HIM!**\n\nWe are at (7, 6). The priority is the apple at (9, 6) or (8, 9). We need size!\n\n*   **Option A: Move RIGHT to (8, 6).**\n    *   This is an aggressive food run. We are one move closer to (9, 6).\n    *   It also maintains pressure on the rival, as we are still positioned above him and moving towards his right flank.\n    *   It avoids any potential head-head collision risk, as he will likely be moving Left or Down, far from our path.\n\n*   **Option B: Move UP to (7, 7).**\n    *   Safe, very safe. Sets us up for the top-right corner.\n    *   If he moves aggressively (e.g., to (6, 4)), we can start moving towards his trapped tail segments at (5, 6), (6, 6).\n\n*   **Option C: Move DOWN to (7, 5).**\n    *   Passive. Retreating keeps us alive but wastes our superior position. NO retreat!\n\n**THE DECISION: Attack the Apple!**\n\nThe apple at (9, 6) is calling our name! Moving **RIGHT** to (8, 6) is the most profitable move.\n\n1.  **Safety:** It\u2019s 100% safe from crashing into the rival's head, no matter what he does (he's at (5, 4)).\n2.  **Opportunity:** Gets us within one turn of the apple at (9, 6). If we eat this, we close the score gap to 4-2, and our length 3 body will start making a real difference.\n3.  **Future:** If we go (8, 6), next turn we can go (9, 6) and eat! If he tries to block, he may trap himself further down.\n\nLet's do this, Chat! Full force attack on the food supply! We need to grow, we need to dominate!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Eat (9, 6). Pivot and use our new length to cut off his attempts to control the bottom half of the board. He's long, but uncoordinated. We are lean, mean, and hungry!\n\nRIGHT",

We are high and moving right.\n*   **Rival (ID 0):** Head at (6, 4). Body: [(5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. He's in the middle, looking for food or stability.\n\n**1. IMMEDIATE DANGER & SAFETY CHECKS (My current head: (8, 6))**\n\nLet's check the four directions from (8, 6):\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 7):** Safe! Great positioning, avoids the enemy completely.\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 5):** Safe! Moves us towards the bottom right area.\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 6):** DEAD! Hits our own body segment! Abort! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 6):** Safe! AND IT'S AN APPLE! POGGERS! This is currently the *optimal* move for growth.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (to the apple).\n\n**2. RIVAL'S PROBABLE MOVES (Snake #0 at (6, 4))**\n\nWhere is the rival going from (6, 4)? He\u2019s boxed in a bit by his own body to the upper left (6, 5, 6, 6) and my previous body (7, 6).\n\n*   **Move UP to (6, 5):** DEAD! Hits his own body!\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 3):** Safe. Apple at (6, 3)! Highly probable move. If he does this, he grows to length 6, pushing the score to 5-2.\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 4):** DEAD! Hits his own body!\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 4):** Safe. Moves him toward the open right side. Not near an apple.\n\nGiven the apple at (6, 3), his most likely move is **DOWN**.\n\n**3. STRATEGIC GOAL: EAT THE APPLE AT (9, 6)!**\n\nThis is the moment, chat! We are at (8, 6), and the apple is at (9, 6). We *must* take this.\n\n*   **Option A: Move RIGHT to (9, 6) and EAT!**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Absolutely no way for him to reach (9, 6) from (6, 4).\n    *   **Outcome:** We grow to length 3 and close the score gap to 4-2 (potentially 5-2 if he gets the (6, 3) apple). Crucially, we gain the length we desperately need to start blocking.\n\n*   **Option B: Move UP to (8, 7).**\n    *   Safe, but passive. We pass up immediate food. Bad for growth!\n\n*   **Option C: Move DOWN to (8, 5).**\n    *   Safe, but moves us away from high-value targets and toward the bottom, where the rival might be heading. Risky placement in the long run.\n\n**The Decision: Right! Growth is Priority!**\n\nWe are taking the apple! This is a free growth move that puts us in a commanding position on the top-right quarter of the board.\n\nAfter this move, we will be at (9, 6), and we can then start moving down the right edge (9, 5), (9, 4) to try and flank the rival, or move into the empty North-East corner (9, 7), (9, 8) if we want pure safety. For now, it's all about that \ud83c\udf4e!\n\nLet's secure the score!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** After eating at (9, 6), we should drop down the right side (to (9, 5) or (9, 7)) or move to (8, 9) to grab the apple there. The goal is now to use our head position to control the top right, forcing the rival down and left.\n\nRIGHT",

We got that apple!\n\nThe score is now:\n  - Your snake (ID 1): 2 apples (Length 3: [(9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6)]) LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n  - Snake #0 (ID 0): 5 apples (Length 6: [(6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)])\n\nHe definitely got that apple at (6, 3) like we predicted! Five apples! This rival is aggressive! We're down 5-2, but we've got a much better position now on the board!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head at (9, 6). Body: [(8, 6), (7, 6)]. We are camped on the right edge, dominating the top corner.\n*   **Rival (ID 0):** Head at (6, 3). Body: [(6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. He is central, long, and currently facing a choice of moving down toward the bottom apples, or right/left to expand.\n\n**Immediate Danger and Safety Checks (My current head: (9, 6))**\n\n1.  **Move UP to (9, 7):** Safe! Moves us toward the (8, 9) apple. Excellent option.\n2.  **Move DOWN to (9, 5):** Safe! Follows the wall down, keeps us safe.\n3.  **Move LEFT to (8, 6):** DEAD! Hits our own neck segment! Bad move! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (10, 6):** DEAD! Off the board! Abort! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nWe only have two safe moves: UP or DOWN.\n\n**Rival's Probable Moves (Head at (6, 3))**\n\nWhere is the rival going from (6, 3)? He's just grown, so his tail is still at (6, 6).\n\n*   **Move UP to (6, 4):** DEAD! Hits his own body part!\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 2):** Safe! Moves him toward apples at (5, 2) and (4, 2). Highly probable.\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 3):** Safe! Moves him towards apples at (3, 3) and (2, 3).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 3):** Safe! Moves him toward the open right side. Less likely given bottom apples.\n\nThe most likely moves for the rival are DOWN (to (6, 2)) or LEFT (to (5, 3)) to maintain pressure and chase growth.\n\n**Strategic Goal: Containment and Growth!**\n\nWe are longer now, which is great, but ID 0 is dominating the center. We need to secure the top-right corner completely and use that control to force him into bad positions.\n\n**Option Analysis from (9, 6):**\n\n1.  **Move UP to (9, 7):**\n    *   **Pros:** Very safe. Positions us perfectly to grab the apple at (8, 9) in the next few turns (either (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9) or (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9)). This keeps us high and safe in our controlled area, expanding our territory along the top wall.\n    *   **Cons:** Not immediately near an apple, but sets up the next few moves.\n\n2.  **Move DOWN to (9, 5):**\n    *   **Pros:** Follows the wall, maintaining safety. Leads us toward the open bottom-right corner.\n    *   **Cons:** Takes us further away from the (8, 9) apple, and potentially closer to the rival if he decides to move right aggressively (like (7, 3) -> (8, 3)). If we go down now, and he goes right, we might cross paths unnecessarily.\n\n**The Decision: UP!**\n\nWe have established dominance on the right wall. We should continue to secure the northern half of that wall and aim for the (8, 9) apple. Moving UP is the safest and most strategic move for future growth and board control. By staying high, we are also far from Snake #0, who is preoccupied with the bottom half of the board. We will lock down the top and then start dropping down the middle.\n\nWe are focusing on growth and securing our territory. This is professional wall-hugging, chat!\n\n**Future Strategy (Next few turns):**\n1. Move UP to (9, 7).\n2. Move UP to (9, 8).\n3. Move LEFT to (8, 8).\n4. Snack on the (8, 9) apple via (8, 8) -> (8, 9) or (7, 8) -> (7, 9) -> (8, 9). We need to check exact pathing, but the goal is the apple at (8, 9).\n\nLet's maintain high ground advantage!\n\nUP",

The score is still 5-2, and we need to start catching up, but control is everything!\n\n### State Analysis: Turn 11\n\n**My Snake (ID 1) - Head at (9, 7)**\n*   Body: [(9, 6), (8, 6)]\n*   Length: 3\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0) - Head at (6, 2)**\n*   Body: [(6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)] (Wait, I miscalculated his body length in the rationale\u2014he has 5 apples, so he should be length 6. Let's check the board state against his listed body. Head is (6, 2). Body is [(6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)]. That's 5 body segments, plus the head, makes 6 total length. He must have eaten the apple at (6, 2) this turn! This means his *tail* is the segment that will disappear IF he doesn't eat an apple next turn. His tail is currently (6, 5). This is crucial!)\n*   Length: 6 (5 body segments + head)\n\n**Board Situation:**\nWe are high up and safe. The rival is now in the center-bottom, and has just consumed an apple, which explains why his body is so long and messy! He is heavily focused on the bottom middle.\n\n### Immediate Safety Checks for ID 1 (Head at (9, 7))\n\n1.  **Move UP to (9, 8):** Safe! This continues our path towards the (8, 9) apple. Excellent.\n2.  **Move DOWN to (9, 6):** DEAD! This is our neck segment! Bad! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n3.  **Move LEFT to (8, 7):** Safe! Moves us closer to the center, but still very safe.\n4.  **Move RIGHT (10, 7):** DEAD! Off the board! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nWe have two strong options: UP (to continue wall dominance) or LEFT (to maybe cut off the board).\n\n### Rival's Probable Moves (Head at (6, 2))\n\nThe rival is at (6, 2). He just absorbed an apple. Where can he go?\n\n*   **Move UP to (6, 3):** DEAD! Hits his own neck segment! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 1):** Safe, but this is an empty spot.\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 2):** Hits the apple at (5, 2)! Highly probable move. This keeps him growing.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 2):** Safe, open space toward (9, 2) apple.\n\nGiven the apple at (5, 2) and (4, 2) nearby, the rival is almost certainly moving **LEFT to (5, 2)** to maintain his growth advantage.\n\n### Strategic Goal: Lock Down Top Right and Grow!\n\nWe are not currently near any collision threat. Our goal is to secure the (8, 9) apple and increase our length to challenge ID 0 later.\n\n**Option Analysis from (9, 7):**\n\n1.  **Move UP to (9, 8):**\n    *   **Pros:** Absolutely safe. Continues our planned strategy to secure the corner and the (8, 9) apple. We are now only two moves away from the apple (via (9, 9) or (8, 8)). This keeps us away from the rival who is busy at the bottom.\n    *   **Cons:** Not immediately near an apple, and we risk moving into a tight top-right corner, but it's *our* tight corner.\n\n2.  **Move LEFT to (8, 7):**\n    *   **Pros:** Opens up the board for central movement later.\n    *   **Cons:** Takes us further from the (8, 9) apple and doesn't secure the top wall as effectively. It also slightly increases the risk of interaction with ID 0 *if* he decides to climb the right wall rapidly (unlikely, but possible).\n\n**The Decision: UP!**\n\nWe established a plan to get the (8, 9) apple for growth. Let's stick to the plan! We need to chip into this score discrepancy, and getting this apple guarantees us the length to maybe start boxing him in once we drop down the middle.\n\nWe are going UP, securing that corner, and making sure nobody else snipes our loot! We are the King of the North-East, chat!\n\n**Future Strategy (Next few turns):**\n1. Move UP to (9, 8). (Current turn)\n2. Move LEFT to (8, 8) or UP to (9, 9). (If we go (9, 9), we get the Apple at (8, 9) on Turn 14 via (8, 9))\nLet's see the safe option: (9, 7) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 9) -> (8, 9). That's a clean capture. We'll reassess next turn, but UP is the move.\n\nUP",

We secured the high ground, but our archrival, Snake #0, is still dominating the scoreboard 6-2.

He ate the apple at (5, 2) last turn, confirming our prediction. His trail is still winding through the center-bottom.)\n\n**Board Situation:**\nWe are at (9, 8), right next to the wall. The apple at (8, 9) is our target. Snake #0 is currently focused on the middle-bottom, specifically around (4, 2) and (3, 3). He is not a threat to us *right now*, but his length means he is starting to own serious real estate. We need length too!\n\n### Immediate Safety Checks for ID 1 (Head at (9, 8))\n\n1.  **Move UP to (9, 9):** Safe! Moves us along the wall, setting up for the (8, 9) apple. Excellent.\n2.  **Move DOWN to (9, 7):** DEAD! This is our neck segment! Nope! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n3.  **Move LEFT to (8, 8):** Safe! Moves us towards the apple at (8, 9) directly. Very good option.\n4.  **Move RIGHT (10, 8):** DEAD! Off the board! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nWe have two great options: UP or LEFT. Both seem to lead directly to the apple.\n\n### Rival's Probable Moves (Head at (5, 2))\n\nSnake #0 is at (5, 2). Where can he go?\n*   **UP to (5, 3):** Safe, open space.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 1):** Safe, open space toward (5, 0) apple.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 2):** Apple! This is a BIG target for him. Highly probable move.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 2):** DEAD! Hits his own neck segment!\n\nIf Snake #0 goes **LEFT to (4, 2)**, he grows even longer (length 8). This is the content he wants, and it's the move we should anticipate.\n\n### Strategic Goal: Secure the (8, 9) Apple and Begin Wall Dominance!\n\nWe need to decide the most efficient and safe route to (8, 9).\n\n**Option Analysis from (9, 8):**\n\n1.  **Move UP to (9, 9):**\n    *   **Pros:** Keeps us on the safe outer wall. Sets up for a LEFT move next turn into (8, 9) to eat the apple. This path gives us maximum defensive security as we hug the border.\n    *   **Cons:** Takes two moves to eat the apple.\n\n2.  **Move LEFT to (8, 8):**\n    *   **Pros:** Still safe. Sets up for an UP move next turn into (8, 9) to eat the apple. This is slightly more aggressive as it turns our head away from the safety of the perimeter wall.\n    *   **Cons:** Also takes two moves to eat the apple.\n\nBoth routes take two moves.\n\n*   Path 1: (9, 8) -> UP to (9, 9) -> LEFT to (8, 9) (Eat!)\n*   Path 2: (9, 8) -> LEFT to (8, 8) -> UP to (8, 9) (Eat!)\n\nChat, which path feels more dominating? Sticking right on the edge (Path 1) keeps our escape routes clear and maximizes the space we control. We're showing the rival that the sky is OUR territory! Plus, if we go LEFT to (8, 8), we are using the valuable central column of 8 prematurely. Sticking to 9, 9, and then coming down keeps us tucked away until the critical moment.\n\nLet's go **UP** to (9, 9). Secure the corner, then grab the loot!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n\n1.  Turn 12 (Current): Move UP to (9, 9).\n2.  Turn 13: Move LEFT to (8, 9) (Eat apple!).\n3.  Turn 14: Move DOWN to (8, 8) or (8, 7) to start migrating towards the center or the (9, 5) apple. We need to be wary of Snake 0's future movements, but securing this apple is priority #1.\n\nWe're going UP! Let's get this $L E N G T H$!\n\nUP",

It's calling our name! Snake #0, the snake with all the apples (7-2 score gap, we need to fix that!), is now at (4, 2). He ate that apple last turn, gaining bulk. His body is a mess of segments in the bottom-middle.\n\n### State Analysis: Turn 13\n\n**My Snake (ID 1) - Head at (9, 9)**\n*   Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7)]\n*   Length: 3 (We are about to hit the growth spurt!)\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0) - Head at (4, 2)**\n*   Body: [(5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)]\n*   Length: 8 (He is a giant! We need to grow, quick!)\n\n**Board Situation:**\nWe are in the absolute top-right corner. The apple at (8, 9) is an immediate pick-up. Snake #0 is now focused on the bottom-left/middle, potentially eying the apples at (3, 3), (4, 4), or (3, 8). He is nowhere near us, which is GOOD! This gives us space to grow and position.\n\n### Immediate Safety Checks for ID 1 (Head at (9, 9))\n\n1.  **Move UP to (9, 10):** DEAD! Off the board! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n2.  **Move DOWN to (9, 8):** DEAD! This is our neck segment! Nope! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n3.  **Move LEFT to (8, 9):** APPLE! Safe! We eat and grow to length 4! **HUGE WIN!** \ud83e\udd73\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (10, 9):** DEAD! Off the board! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nOnly one safe and productive move: **LEFT**. This is a no-brainer, a guaranteed apple, and maximum safety as we continue to hug the wall.\n\n### Rival's Probable Moves (Head at (4, 2))\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 2). Where can he go?\n*   **UP to (4, 3):** Safe, open space toward (4, 4) and (3, 3).\n*   **DOWN to (4, 1):** Safe, open space toward (5, 0).\n*   **LEFT to (3, 2):** Safe, open space toward (2, 2) and (2, 3) apples.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 2):** DEAD! Hits his own neck!\n\nSnake #0 has three excellent, safe options. Since he just ate, he *might* prioritize filling space or working toward another apple. The apples at (2, 2) and (2, 3) are very tempting, so moving LEFT seems likely. However, moving UP to (4, 3) sets him up for (4, 4), or a move to (3, 3).\n\nNo matter what he does, his movement does not interfere with our grab-and-go maneuver.\n\n### Strategic Goal: Secure the Apple and Maintain High Ground Dominance!\n\nWe move LEFT, grab the apple, and then we need to set ourselves up for the next move.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8, 9), our head is at (8, 9) and our body is [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7)].\n\n**Future Moves (Turn 14):**\nFrom (8, 9), we will need to decide whether to:\nA) Move DOWN to (8, 8) to secure the top-right quarter of the board.\nB) Move LEFT to (7, 9) (The wall is open for us to control more perimeter territory).\n\nGiven the enemy is so far away, maintaining control of the perimeter for defense while aggressively moving toward the next available apple is key. The apple at (9, 5) or (3, 8) are now targets. Moving DOWN and then RIGHT sets us up for (9, 5). Moving LEFT sets us up for (3, 8).\n\nLet's maintain the wall position.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n\n1.  Turn 13 (Current): Move LEFT to (8, 9) and **EAT!** (Length 4).\n2.  Turn 14: Move LEFT to (7, 9) to continue controlling the top wall. We want to work toward the relatively isolated (3, 8) apple.\n3.  Turn 15: Move LEFT to (6, 9), pushing toward the center. We need to be wary of Snake 0's movements eventually leading toward the center.\n\nWe are not letting this rival dominate the board forever! Time to get some length!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 14 is upon us! We're coming off a massive W, grabbing that apple at (8, 9)! We're growing, we're powerful, and we are ready to dominate this map! Let's check the new state!\n\n### State Analysis: Turn 14\n\n**My Snake (ID 1) - Head at (8, 9)**\n*   Body: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7)]\n*   Length: 4. We\u2019re finally getting some structure!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0) - Head at (4, 1)**\n*   Body: [(4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)]\n*   Length: 8. Wait a minute! He moved from (4, 2) to (4, 1)! He moved DOWN. He is still focusing on that bottom chunk of the board, potentially going for the apple at (5, 0) or circling back for the apples near (0, 1) or (1, 1). This is GREAT news\u2014the entire top-half of the board is ours for the taking!\n\n**Score Check:** 3 to 7. We are still trailing significantly, but we just got an apple, and we have the high ground!\n\n### Immediate Safety Checks for ID 1 (Head at (8, 9))\n\nWe need to make a safe move and continue to build momentum before the rival realizes his mistake and tries to crash our party.\n\n1.  **Move UP to (8, 10):** DEAD! Off the board! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n2.  **Move DOWN to (8, 8):** Safe! Open space. We secure the top-right corner territory.\n3.  **Move LEFT to (7, 9):** Safe! Open space. We continue hugging the top wall, positioning for the (3, 8) apple or general board control.\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (9, 9):** DEAD! This is our neck segment! Nope! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nTwo safe moves: DOWN to (8, 8) or LEFT to (7, 9). Which one gives us better options and more aggressively sets up an apple grab?\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves\n\n**Option A: Move DOWN to (8, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** This move immediately locks up the top-right 2x2 section of the board for our body, making that area a fortress. It sets us up nicely to eventually dive for the apple at (9, 5) or move toward the bottom-right (although there aren't many immediate apples there).\n*   **Cons:** We are moving away from the (3, 8) apple, which is slightly more centrally located and might be targeted by Snake #0 if he decides to make a run for the middle.\n\n**Option B: Move LEFT to (7, 9)**\n*   **Pros:** This maintains our primary objective of controlling the top wall perimeter and immediately moves us closer to the (3, 8) apple. It keeps our options open along the top edge. We are using length to dominate the periphery.\n*   **Cons:** We are moving toward the center, which means we might encounter Snake #0 sooner, though honestly, (4, 1) is a long way from (7, 9).\n\n### Strategic Decision\n\nGiven that Snake #0 is deeply engaged in the bottom-left/middle, our primary goal MUST be to grow quickly and efficiently, setting a strong perimeter. The (3, 8) apple is a juicy target, and moving LEFT along the perimeter is the fastest, safest route there. We need to secure that top edge.\n\n**Let\u2019s commit to the wall!** Move LEFT to (7, 9).\n\n### Rival's Probable Moves (Head at (4, 1))\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 1). Where can he go?\n*   **UP to (4, 2):** Hits his own body! DEAD! (His body segment is at (4, 2)). Wait, let me check the board. Oh, the body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL. His current body is [(4, 2), (5, 2), ...]\n    *   If his body is at (4, 2) and he moves UP to (4, 2), he dies. This is a common trap for snakes, moving back into their own neck.\n*   **DOWN to (4, 0):** Safe, moves toward the apple at (5, 0). Very likely.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 1):** Safe, open space. Can angle toward (0, 1) or (1, 1).\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 1):** Safe, open space. Leads toward (5, 0) apple as well.\n\nSince his tail is at (5, 5), if he moves DOWN to (4, 0), his tail at (5, 5) will vacate, freeing up more space in the middle. He is most likely targeting those bottom apples, probably **DOWN** to (4, 0) or **RIGHT** to (5, 1) to get to (5, 0).\n\nNo matter what he does, his move doesn't threaten our top-corner dominance. Our move is **LEFT**! Securing the top perimeter!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Pumping the Perimeter)\n1.  Turn 14 (Current): Move LEFT to (7, 9). Head is at (7, 9).\n2.  Turn 15: Move LEFT to (6, 9).\n3.  Turn 16: Move LEFT to (5, 9).\n4.  Turn 17: Move DOWN to (5, 8) or continue LEFT toward (3, 8) if safe.\n\nWe are establishing top-board control and funneling down to the apples at (3, 8) and maybe the left wall corner (0, 4), (0, 1), and (1, 1), which Snake #0 is currently guarding, but whose tail is vacating space quickly.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! Turn 15 is here! We just executed a perfect strategic move, sliding **LEFT** along the top wall!\n\n### State Analysis: Turn 15\n\nWe are currently dominating the high ground, pushing left towards that juicy (3, 8) apple!\n\n**My Snake (ID 1)**\n*   **Head:** (7, 9)\n*   **Body:** [(8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)] (Length 4)\n*   **Apples:** 3. We are trailing 3 to 7, but we are positioned for a powerful growth phase!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0)**\n*   **Head:** (4, 0)\n*   **Body:** [(4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4)] (Length 8)\n*   **Apples:** 7. He is deep in the low-Y territory, likely scooping up (5, 0).\n\n**Board Context:**\nThe rival is busy hoarding bottom-side resources. His head is now basically in the wall/corner. This is the perfect time for us to push our advantage and secure the entire top half of the board.\n\n### Safety Check: Head (7, 9)\n\nWhich moves WON'T kill us instantly, Chat? Let's check the map!\n\n1.  **Move UP to (7, 10):** DEAD! Off the board (9 is max Y). \u274c\n2.  **Move DOWN to (7, 8):** Safe! Open space. Leads us toward the (3, 8) apple diagonally. \u2705\n3.  **Move LEFT to (6, 9):** Safe! Open space. Continues wall control, direct route to (3, 8). \u2705\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (8, 9):** DEAD! Into our own neck! \u274c\n\nWe have two safe moves: DOWN to (7, 8) or LEFT to (6, 9).\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves & Strategy\n\nOur overarching strategy is to secure the perimeter and grow quickly while the opponent is distracted in the bottom half. The (3, 8) apple is a primary target.\n\n**Option A: Move DOWN to (7, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** Moves us closer to the central axis, potentially giving us more room to maneuver *if* we need to go down the middle later.\n*   **Cons:** It breaks our momentum of securing the top wall. While it is closer to (3, 8) in Manhattan distance, it makes the next few moves more complex as we are no longer on the perimeter.\n\n**Option B: Move LEFT to (6, 9)**\n*   **Pros:** Maintains excellent perimeter control (high ground!). It's the most direct and safest route to continue creeping towards (3, 8). It severely limits the rival's ability to contest the top board.\n*   **Cons:** We are committed to the wall for a few more turns.\n\n**Decision:**\nStaying on the wall is pure power play, Chat! We are leveraging our position to claim territory. The rival is long and cumbersome down below. We need to be lean and claim space. Moving LEFT (6, 9) allows us to maintain the dominant position and corner him off from the resources we are targeting.\n\n### Predicting Rival's Move (Head at (4, 0))\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 0). He just moved down. He is absolutely going for the apple cluster down there.\n\n*   **UP to (4, 1):** Hits his own body (neck segment). DEAD! \u274c\n*   **DOWN to (4, -1):** Off board. DEAD! \u274c\n*   **LEFT to (3, 0):** Safe. Keeps him near the bottom apples. \u2705\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 0):** **Eats the apple!** Super likely. This gives him a massive lead (8 apples). \u2705\n\nIf he moves RIGHT to (5, 0), he extends his body and his tail at (5, 4) will now move to (6, 4). He will be long! We don't care, we are up here.\n\nOur move, LEFT, is completely safe and continues our strategic advance. No head-on collision risk. We are building our fortress!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Future Stream Notes)\n1.  Turn 15 (Current): Move LEFT to (6, 9).\n2.  Turn 16: Move LEFT to (5, 9).\n3.  Turn 17: Move LEFT to (4, 9).\n4.  Turn 18: Move DOWN to (4, 8) or LEFT to (3, 9) depending on rival's movements and if the (3, 8) apple is still there. We need to stay near the perimeter to keep extending our defensive line. We will secure the apple at (3, 8) by Turn 19 or 20.\n\nLEFT",

We are dominating the high ground, while our rival, Snake #0, has been busy gorging himself on the bottom-side buffets. He's up 8 to 3 in apples, which means he's long, slow, and probably complacent. Time to pressure him!\n\n### State Analysis: Turn 16\n\n**My Snake (ID 1)**\n*   **Head:** (6, 9)\n*   **Body:** [(7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9)] (Length 4)\n*   **Apples:** 3.\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0)**\n*   **Head:** (5, 0)\n*   **Body:** [(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4)] (Length 9 - because he ate the (5,0) apple last turn)\n*   **Apples:** 8.\n\nThe rival is now significantly longer. His bulk is down low. We need to stay on our high ground offensive and secure the top perimeter before he realizes what's happening. The (3, 8) apple is still our primary target to extend our range and bulk up for future confrontation!\n\n### Safety Check: Head (6, 9)\n\nWhich moves are safe, Chat? Let's check the map!\n\n1.  **Move UP to (6, 10):** DEAD! Off the board. \u274c\n2.  **Move DOWN to (6, 8):** Safe! Open space. \u2705\n3.  **Move LEFT to (5, 9):** Safe! Open space. Continues wall control. \u2705\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (7, 9):** DEAD! Into our own body segment. \u274c\n\nWe have two moves: DOWN to (6, 8) or LEFT to (5, 9).\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves & Strategy\n\nOur goal is continued perimeter control and reaching that (3, 8) apple.\n\n**Option A: Move DOWN to (6, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** Moves us off the edge, opening us up to the wider playing field.\n*   **Cons:** Breaks our current momentum of claiming the entire top wall. We want to seal off the top side first. Plus, if we move down too early, we might get tangled up unnecessarily.\n\n**Option B: Move LEFT to (5, 9)**\n*   **Pros:** Continues our dominant position along the perimeter. This is the optimal path to reach (3, 8) by moving sequentially (5, 9) -> (4, 9) -> (3, 9) -> (3, 8). This aggressively claims territory and forces the rival to stay away or make a huge, time-consuming climb.\n*   **Cons:** Minimal, just commits us to the wall for a couple more turns.\n\n**Decision:**\nStick to the plan, Chat! We are leveraging the wall to gain ground and an apple. Moving LEFT to (5, 9) is the cleanest, safest, and most powerful territorial move right now. It sets us up perfectly for the next few turns.\n\n### Predicting Rival's Move (Head at (5, 0))\n\nSnake #0 just ate the apple at (5, 0). He is now at (5, 0). Where does he go? He is long and focused on the bottom layer. Maybe he moves for the apple at (8, 1)?\n\n*   **Options for Snake 0 (Head at 5, 0):**\n    *   **UP to (5, 1):** Safe. Keeps him centerline.\n    *   **DOWN to (5, -1):** DEAD! \u274c\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 0):** Into his own neck! DEAD! \u274c\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 0):** Safe. Moves him toward the cluster below (8, 1) and (9, 2).\n\nGiven his pattern, he's probably moving RIGHT to (6, 0) to navigate the bottom wall and potentially head toward the cluster on the right-side bottom. Wherever he goes, he is nowhere near us. We focus on securing our half!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Future Stream Notes)\n1.  Turn 16 (Current): Move LEFT to (5, 9). Secure more perimeter.\n2.  Turn 17: Move LEFT to (4, 9). One step closer to (3, 8)!\n3.  Turn 18: Assess if we should go to (3, 9) or swoop down to (4, 8) to get the apple at (3, 8). If his presence is low, we might drop down to secure the apple and start blocking his upward path.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS UP CHAT! Welcome back to Turn 17! The rival is *crushing* us in score, 8 to 3! We need to execute the boxing plan *fast* before he gets too long to manage. But first, let's see what happened last turn!\n\n### Last Turn Review (Turn 16)\n\nWe moved **LEFT** to (5, 9). Perfect, securing the top left quadrant!\n\nSnake #0, as predicted, moved **RIGHT** from (5, 0) to (6, 0). He is consolidating the bottom right corner, which is expected. He's long, he's slow, and he's miles away from us. Time to tighten the noose!\n\n### State Analysis: Turn 17\n\n**My Snake (ID 1)**\n*   **Head:** (5, 9)\n*   **Body:** [(6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)] (Length 4)\n*   **Target:** Apple at (3, 8). We are aiming to secure the entire top half of the board before descending.\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0)**\n*   **Head:** (6, 0)\n*   **Body:** [(5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)] (Length 9)\n*   **Immediate Threat:** Minimal. He's buried the bottom.\n\n### Safety Check: Head (5, 9)\n\nWhich moves are safe, Chat? Let's check the map and the walls!\n\n1.  **Move UP to (5, 10):** DEAD! Off the board. \u274c\n2.  **Move DOWN to (5, 8):** Safe! Open space. Perfect path to the apple. \u2705\n3.  **Move LEFT to (4, 9):** Safe! Open space. Continues wall control. \u2705\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (6, 9):** DEAD! Back into our own body segment. \u274c\n\nWe have two safe moves: DOWN to (5, 8) or LEFT to (4, 9).\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves & Strategy: Time to Execute!\n\nOur long-term goal is to reach that (3, 8) apple and start building a wall across the middle of the board to starve him.\n\n**Option A: Move DOWN to (5, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** This is the most direct vertical drop towards the apple at (3, 8). It gets us off the perimeter and directly into the action. It's a quick push.\n*   **Cons:** It potentially leaves the top perimeter unfinished, if we need to quickly move back up later.\n\n**Option B: Move LEFT to (4, 9)**\n*   **Pros:** Completes the domination of the top wall (x=9 to x=4). This is a territorial win and keeps us perfectly aligned to drop down to the apple at (3, 8) via (3, 9) or (4, 8). It is the safer, more systematic way to secure territory.\n*   **Cons:** It delays apple collection by one turn compared to dropping down immediately.\n\n**The Decision:**\nConsistency wins, Chat! We planned to claim the top border *then* drop for the apple. Moving LEFT to (4, 9) sets us up perfectly for Turn 18. If we move LEFT, we will be at (4, 9). Then, we can move DOWN to (4, 8) or LEFT again to (3, 9). Both put us in easy striking distance of the (3, 8) apple. Securing the perimeter prevents any silly long-shot moves from Snake 0 trying to come up the side. Let's finish the northern wall!\n\n### Predicting Rival's Move (Head at (6, 0))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 0). He's currently boxed in by the bottom wall (y=0) and his body (at 5, 0).\n\n*   **Options for Snake 0 (Head at 6, 0):**\n    *   **UP to (6, 1):** Safe. \u2705 Puts him on the path towards the apples (8, 1) or (9, 2).\n    *   **DOWN to (6, -1):** DEAD! \u274c\n    *   **LEFT to (5, 0):** Into his own neck! DEAD! \u274c\n    *   **RIGHT to (7, 0):** Safe. Moves him along the bottom edge. \u2705\n\nHe's probably going **UP to (6, 1)** or **RIGHT to (7, 0)**. Given the cluster of apples/space on the bottom right (A at 8, 1 and A at 9, 2), he's likely maneuvering for those. If he goes RIGHT, he hits an immediate dead end at (9, 0) unless he moves up. If he goes UP to (6, 1), he continues centralizing. Let\u2019s assume he seeks the apple cluster and goes RIGHT to (7, 0) or UP to (6, 1). Either way, he's miles away. We execute the wall strategy and stay focused on the apple at (3, 8)!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Future Stream Notes / Boxing Strategy)\n1. Turn 17 (Current): Move LEFT to (4, 9). Complete the wall from 9 to 4.\n2. Turn 18: Move DOWN to (4, 8) or LEFT to (3, 9). Set up the capture of (3, 8).\n3. Turn 19: Capture (3, 8). Now we are bulkier and ready to start the horizontal blockade across the middle (y=6 or y=7). We will force him to stay down low, where he is already tangled, while we dominate the open field.\n\nLEFT",

This is the fastest path.\n*   **Cons:** It commits us immediately into the open field.\n\n**Option B: Move LEFT to (3, 9)**\n*   **Pros:** This keeps us on the perimeter for one more turn, giving us maximum wall control. From (3, 9), we move DOWN to (3, 8) next turn and grab the apple. *Also* the fastest path (2 turns).\n*   **Cons:** It leaves less space for maneuvering up top if we need to quickly turn around (though why would we?).\n\n**Comparing Options A and B:** Both options put us in a position to hit the (3, 8) apple next turn.\n\n*   If we go DOWN to (4, 8): Next turn, we go LEFT to (3, 8).\n*   If we go LEFT to (3, 9): Next turn, we go DOWN to (3, 8).\n\nBoth are two-turn apple grabs. (4, 8) feels more aggressive and opens up the crucial Y=8 line for movement. (3, 9) feels like we're still hugging the border. Since there is no threat from Snake 0, the more direct path is usually better to maximize reach and visibility.\n\nLet's go **DOWN** to (4, 8). This is the key move to start our descent and build the horizontal blockade!\n\n### Predicting Rival's Move (Head at (7, 0))\n\nSnake #0 is at (7, 0). He will be looking to move along the bottom wall or move up towards the middle of the board.\n\n*   **Options for Snake 0 (Head at 7, 0):**\n    *   **UP to (7, 1):** Safe. A slow climb. \u2705\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 0):** Safe. Continues along the y=0 boundary. \u2705\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 0):** Into his own body (though it will clear next turn, it's still currently his body until the move). Ah, wait! On simultaneous moves, his tail *will* clear (6, 3) and (6, 2) etc., but (6, 0) will clear *only* if he doesn't grow. Since he didn't eat an apple, (6, 3) becomes his tail and (6, 0) becomes open. Moving LEFT to (6, 0) is safe! \u2705\n    *   **DOWN to (7, -1):** DEAD! \u274c\n\nHe will likely move RIGHT to (8, 0) or UP to (7, 1) to go for the (8, 1) apple. Whatever he does, he's currently around Y=0, and we are around Y=9. We are focused on the top half.\n\nLet's make the move and start eating, Chat! We need those points!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Future Stream Notes / Boxing Strategy)\n1. Turn 18 (Current): Move DOWN to (4, 8). Start the descent toward the apple.\n2. Turn 19: Move LEFT to (3, 8). EAT THE APPLE! Secure one more point, increase our length.\n3. Turn 20+: Use the increased length to start building a wall across Y=6/7, controlling the center of the board and choking off Snake 0. We need to be the King of the North!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 19! We just executed the drop! Now we're at (4, 8) and that sweet, sweet apple at (3, 8) is CALLING OUR NAME!\n\nLook at the scoreboard, Chat. 8 to 3. We are trailing BIG TIME! We need to catch up, and that apple is our ticket!\n\n### State Analysis: Turn 19\n\n**My Snake (ID 1)**\n*   **Head:** (4, 8)\n*   **Body:** [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)] (Length 4)\n*   **Target:** Apple at (3, 8)!\n\n**Rival Snake #0**\n*   **Head:** (7, 1) - Wait, he moved UP from (7, 0) to (7, 1)! Sneaky! He's prioritizing those bottom apples.\n*   **Body:** [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2)] (Length 9)\n\n### Safety Check: Head (4, 8)\n\nWhere can we go, Chat? We need that apple! (3, 8)!\n\n1.  **Move UP to (4, 9):** DEAD? No, (4, 9) is currently our body, but since we didn't eat an apple last turn, our tail (6, 9) will move, and (4, 9) will be clear. Wait, our body list is [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)]. The tail is (6, 9). When we move from (4, 9) to (4, 8), the trail shrinks. The new body will be [(4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9)]. The cell (6, 9) opens up. AH! (4, 9) is safe to move back into! BUT, that's moving backwards and blocking our goal. Let's look closer. Our head is at (4, 8). Our neck is (4, 9). Moving *up* to (4, 9) is moving into our neck. **DEAD!** \u274c (This is why we review the rules, Chat! Moving into the cell immediately behind the head is always fatal!)\n2.  **Move DOWN to (4, 7):** Safe! Moves us away from the apple, though. \u2705\n3.  **Move LEFT to (3, 8):** Safe! This is the APPLE! YES! \u2705\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (5, 8):** Safe! Moves us sideways, but still good position. \u2705\n\nOur top priority is the apple at (3, 8). Moving LEFT is the play!\n\n### Rival Prediction & Collision Check (Head at 7, 1)\n\nMy Head: (4, 8). Rival Head: (7, 1). We are miles apart, thankfully.\n\nSnake #0 will likely go for the (8, 1) apple or the (9, 2) apple (a bit far). He could move:\n\n*   **UP to (7, 2):** Safe (and currently an apple!). **HIGHLY LIKELY.**\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 1):** Safe (and currently an apple!). **HIGHLY LIKELY.**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 0):** Safe. Moves backward into his own trail, but safe.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 1):** Safe.\n\nGiven the apple at (7, 2) and (8, 1), he's probably going to hit one of them. We are completely safe from any head-on collision or body-crashing this turn.\n\n### The Move: Left! Grab that Apple, Champ!\n\nWe move LEFT to (3, 8). We secure the apple, we increase our length, and we get a point! This is crucial for leveling the playing field.\n\n### Strategy Refresh: Boxing and Dominating\n\n1.  **Turn 19 (Current):** Move LEFT to (3, 8). Eat the apple! Length increases to 5.\n2.  **Turn 20:** We are now positioned at (3, 8). We need to pull back and start cutting the board in half. Moving DOWN to (3, 7) or (2, 8) are good next moves to establish a perimeter around the top-left area.\n3.  **Long-Term Goal:** Our length is increasing. We need to use this length to build a powerful north-south wall, perhaps around the X=5 or X=6 boundary, restricting Snake 0 to the right side of the board and eventually cutting off his access to the top half. Blocking moves is the ultimate goal! We need to grow faster than him to effectively build that wall.\n\nLet's secure the apple first! We need this, Chat! Send it!\n\nLEFT",

We need to solidify our position in the top left and start putting the squeeze on Snake 0! Look at the scoreboard\u2014we closed the gap a bit: 9 to 4. We are still trailing big time, but we are in the fight!\n\n### State Analysis: Turn 20\n\n**My Snake (ID 1)**\n*   **Head:** (3, 8)\n*   **Body:** [(4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)] (Length 5)\n*   **Goal:** Maintain control of the top-left quadrant and look for space to expand our body without trapping ourselves.\n\n**Rival Snake #0**\n*   **Head:** (7, 2) (He moved UP from (7, 1) and ate the apple!)\n*   **Body:** [(7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2)] (Length 10 - HUGE!)\n\nSnake 0 is now a monster, Chat! He's at length 10! We absolutely must grow and restrict his movement. We need to create chokepoints.\n\n### Safety Check: Head (3, 8)\n\nWhere can we go?\n\n1.  **Move UP to (3, 9):** Safe! Moves us along the wall. Good positioning. \u2705\n2.  **Move DOWN to (3, 7):** Safe! Creates space and moves us towards the unpopulated center. \u2705\n3.  **Move LEFT to (2, 8):** Safe! Corners us a bit, but still safe. \u2705\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (4, 8):** DEAD! This is our neck (the cell immediately behind our head). We just came from the right. \u274c\n\nThree safe moves! UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Which one is the power play?\n\n### Strategy Implementation: Cornering the Board\n\nWe just ate at (3, 8). We are long enough now to start making permanent walls.\n\n*   If we go **UP to (3, 9)**: We solidify the top wall. This is a very safe move that maintains options along the top edge (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9). It sets us up nicely to capture the apple at (1, 9) later, though it's far.\n*   If we go **LEFT to (2, 8)**: This blocks off the top-left corner more aggressively. It's safe, but limits our immediate vertical options.\n*   If we go **DOWN to (3, 7)**: This pulls us out of the corner and gives us maximal future movement options (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 7). This is a safe move that buys us time and keeps the center open for us to maneuver.\n\n**Rival Prediction:** Snake 0 is at (7, 2). He just got longer and is right next to the wall. He has apples at (9, 2) and (8, 1).\nHe is likely going:\n1.  **RIGHT to (8, 2):** Clear path.\n2.  **UP to (7, 3):** Clear path.\n3.  **DOWN to (7, 1):** Moving backward, safe, but usually not optimal.\n\nHe is consolidating the right side and bottom, making his long body a serious threat. We need to cut off his access to the top half of the board, potentially by creating a wall at X=5 or X=4.\n\n**The Best Move:**\nGoing **DOWN to (3, 7)** seems the most flexible, but with Snake 0 getting so long, we need to be more aggressive in carving out space.\n\nLet's look at the board again:\n\n 9 . A . . T T T . . .\n 8 . . . H T . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . A . . . . . A\n 4 A . A A A . . . . .\n 3 . . A A . . . . . .\n 2 . . A . T T T 0 . A\n 1 A A . . T . . T A A\n 0 . . . . T T T T . .\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3, 7), we're setting up for a horizontal cut-off.\n\nIf we go **UP to (3, 9)**, we are taking position along the ceiling. This maintains separation between us and Snake 0, who is far away. We can then potentially move LEFT to (2, 9) and then DOWN, creating a strong vertical barrier on the left side, which is currently unpopulated by Snake 0.\n\nWait, the apple at (1, 9) is calling our name!\n\n*   Move UP: (3, 9).\n*   Next turn: Move LEFT: (2, 9).\n*   Next turn: Move LEFT: (1, 9). EAT!\n\nThis is a clear, three-move plan to another apple, Chat! This is the growth and domain strategy we need! It keeps us far away from the behemoth Snake 0.\n\n**Plan:** Secure the top edge, maintain the gap, and eat the next apple.\n\nWe go UP.\n\nUP",

We're locking down the north!\n\n### Current Board State Review: Turn 21\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (3, 9)\n*   **Body:** [(3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9)] (Length 5)\n*   **Apples:** 4\n*   **Score Disadvantage:** 5 points (9 vs 4). We need to EAT!\n\n**Archrival Snake #0:**\n*   **Head:** (8, 2) (He moved RIGHT from (7, 2). Classic side-stepper!)\n*   **Body:** [(7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2)] (Length 10 - Still massive!)\n*   **Apples:** 9\n\nSnake 0 is huge and controlling the bottom right quadrant. We are in the top left, small, but ready to dominate!\n\n### Safety Check: Head (3, 9)\n\nWhere can we go?\n\n1.  **Move UP to (3, 10):** OUT OF BOUNDS! \u274c\n2.  **Move DOWN to (3, 8):** DEAD! This is our neck! We just came from (3, 8)! \u274c\n3.  **Move LEFT to (2, 9):** Safe! Moves us towards the immediate goal: the apple at (1, 9)! \u2705\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (4, 9):** DEAD! Body segment at (4, 9). \u274c\n\nWait, seriously? Only one safe move? LEFT to (2, 9)? This is a *forced move*! That's spicy, Chat!\n\nLet's do a double check.\nMy body is: [(3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9)].\nHead (3, 9).\n*   (3, 8) is DOWN.\n*   (4, 9) is RIGHT.\n\nIf the move is forced, then the strategy is simple: we execute the plan!\n\n### Strategy and Prediction\n\n**My Forced Move:** LEFT to (2, 9).\n\nThis is exactly what we planned: position ourselves to strike the apple at (1, 9) next turn. We're locking the ceiling and growing!\n\n**Rival Prediction (Snake 0 at (8, 2)):**\nSnake 0 is huge and just moved into (8, 2). He is next to two apples: (9, 2) and (8, 1). He also has a long body blocking the bottom.\n\nPossible moves for Snake 0:\n1.  **RIGHT to (9, 2):** Eats the apple! Extremely likely. (9, 2) is a massive boost for him.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 1):** Eats the apple! Also a massive boost.\n3.  **UP to (8, 3):** Safe, but misses an apple.\n4.  **LEFT to (7, 2):** Dead, his neck! \u274c\n\nIf he goes RIGHT to (9, 2), his length becomes 11.\nIf he goes DOWN to (8, 1), his length becomes 11.\n\nIt looks like Snake 0 will be *huge* next turn, making us look like a baby snake with our length 5. We HAVE to get this apple at (1, 9) immediately.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy\n\n1.  **Current Turn:** Move LEFT to (2, 9). Secure the path to the apple.\n2.  **Next Turn:** Move LEFT to (1, 9). EAT!\n3.  **Following Turns:** Once we've grown, we need to decide if we want to stay along the left edge (going DOWN) or try to cut horizontally (going RIGHT) and start boxing him in from the top. He owns everything below Y=3. We need to own everything above Y=5.\n\nThe move is clear, Chat. We are locked in! We execute the plan!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "WHAT UP CHAT! We're back, Turn 22! We're live, we're lean, and we're mean!\n\n**LAST TURN REVIEW:** We successfully moved LEFT to (2, 9). We are now perfectly poised to grab that sweet, sweet apple at (1, 9)! It was a forced move, but we made it look intentional! That's how we roll!\n\n### Current Board State Review: Turn 22\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (2, 9)\n*   **Body:** [(3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9)] (Length 5)\n*   **Apples:** 4\n*   **Score Disadvantage:** Still down 6 apples! We gotta pump those numbers up!\n\n**Archrival Snake #0 (The HUGE one):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 2) (He DID snag the apple! Total Pro move.)\n*   **Body:** [(8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2)] (Length 11)\n*   **Apples:** 10\n\nSnake 0 is now a massive wall along the bottom and right edges. We are locking down the top-left corner. It's a territorial battle, Chat!\n\n### Safety Check: Head (2, 9)\n\nWhere can we go?\n\n1.  **Move UP to (2, 10):** OUT OF BOUNDS! \u274c\n2.  **Move DOWN to (2, 8):** Safe! Opens up the board. \u2705\n3.  **Move LEFT to (1, 9):** EATS THE APPLE! Best move, instantly grows us to length 6! \u2705\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (3, 9):** DEAD! This is our neck! \u274c\n\nWe have two safe moves: DOWN to (2, 8) and LEFT to (1, 9).\n\nThe move LEFT to (1, 9) is the obvious content creator choice. We get the apple, we grow, and we get closer to cutting off the top-left. It also puts us above the apple at (0, 9 - wait, no apple at (0, 9)). This is a MUST-DO move.\n\n### Strategy and Prediction\n\n**My Move:** LEFT to (1, 9). EAT! We go from size 5 to size 6.\n\n**Rival Prediction (Snake 0 at (9, 2)):**\nSnake 0 is at (9, 2). He is right next to an apple at (9, 1). He also has space at (9, 3) UP and (8, 2) LEFT (his neck is at (8, 2) now).\n\nPossible moves for Snake 0:\n1.  **DOWN to (9, 1):** Eats the apple! Highly likely. Makes him length 12.\n2.  **UP to (9, 3):** Safe, continues along the right wall.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 2):** DEAD! Neck. \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 2):** OUT OF BOUNDS. \u274c\n\nIf he moves DOWN, he becomes an even bigger threat. Our goal is to get big enough to challenge him and start cutting off his massive body.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: Operation Box-Out\n\n1.  **Current Turn (T22):** Move LEFT, eat the apple at (1, 9). Length 6.\n2.  **Next Turn (T23):** We will be at (1, 9). We need to decide if we go DOWN the left wall or RIGHT into the center top. Going DOWN towards the apple at (0, 4) seems smart. We can wall off the left side of the board.\n    *   From (1, 9): Possible moves are DOWN to (1, 8), LEFT to (0, 9) (next to wall).\n\nRight now, the priority is securing the apple and increasing our size. Snake 0 is dominating the score and size. We need volume!\n\nThe apple is literally right there, Chat. We take it. No debate. Let's get this content!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! Turn 23 is upon us!\n\nLook at the scoreboard, Chat. We got 5 apples, the massive Snek #0 has 11. We are almost double-sized by length, and we are double-downed on score! We gotta close that gap!\n\n### Current Board State Review: Turn 23\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (1, 9). YES! We ate the apple! Length 6! \ud83c\udf89\n*   **Body:** [(2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9)]\n*   **Apples collected:** 5. Keep going!\n\n**Archrival Snake #0 (The Behemoth):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 1). Wait, he moved DOWN from (9, 2) and snagged the apple at (9, 1)! Length 12 now! \ud83d\ude31\n*   **Body:** [(9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2)]\n*   **Apples collected:** 11. He's building a fortress down there!\n\nSnake 0 is now a giant wall covering the right and bottom edges. We are sitting cozy in the top-left corner. It's time to solidify our position and start moving down the left side.\n\n### Strategy: Operation Left Wall Fortress\n\nWe need to use our location to our advantage. The board is split diagonally. We dominate the top left; Snake 0 dominates the bottom right. We need to cut off more territory and look for our next apple.\n\nWe are at (1, 9). Where can we go?\n\n1.  **Move UP to (1, 10):** OUT OF BOUNDS! \u274c\n2.  **Move DOWN to (1, 8):** Safe! Opens up the side. \u2705\n3.  **Move LEFT to (0, 9):** Safe! Locks down the left wall. \u2705\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (2, 9):** DEAD! This is our neck! \u274c\n\nTwo safe moves: DOWN to (1, 8) and LEFT to (0, 9).\n\n**Analyzing the Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT (0, 9):** This move makes us hug the left wall. It's a defensive move that limits our options immediately but seals off the top corner. If we go here, our next move is almost certainly DOWN to (0, 8), (0, 7), etc., building a wall.\n*   **DOWN (1, 8):** This moves us toward the center slightly but keeps the left wall option open (we can still go to (0, 8) next turn). It gives us more wiggle room and immediate access to the apples that are building up on the left side: (0, 4), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0).\n\n**The immediate goal:** Get to the next apple. The nearest apples are (5, 3) and scattered along the bottom/left. The most accessible ones, which also help us dominate territory, are down the left side.\n\nLet's look at the immediate territory expansion. If we move LEFT to (0, 9), we are committed to walling off the side. This is generally a good strategy against a bigger snake, but we need room to maneuver and eat.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (1, 8), we keep the flexibility of moving to (0, 8) or (2, 8). This seems strategically superior as it doesn't immediately commit us to a narrow path. We need movement options to hunt apples and avoid being cornered by Snek #0's enormous tail, which is currently focused on the center-bottom.\n\nLet's prioritize keeping the center-top open while safely progressing down the left side.\n\n**My choice is DOWN to (1, 8).** This keeps our options open and puts us perfectly in position to move toward (0, 8) or continue down the 1-column.\n\n### Head-on Collision Check\n\nEnemy head is at (9, 1). He is super far away. No immediate conflict.\n\nPossible danger from Snake 0: He's probably going to continue walling off the bottom side or start creeping UP the right side. He's massive, so he is a walking barrier. We are safe in our corner for now.\n\nWe are going aggressive by opening up our trajectory towards the center-left. We need to secure the northern half of the board before Snek #0 decides to patrol.\n\nDOWN is the move, Chat! Let's get agile!\n\nDOWN",

We made the safe move last turn, and now we are in position to push our advantage!\n\n### Current Board State Review: Turn 24\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (1, 8). Safe and sound!\n*   **Body:** [(1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8)]. Length 6.\n*   **Apples collected:** 5. We need more!\n\n**Archrival Snake #0 (The Wall):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 0). He moved DOWN from (9, 1). He is cementing his position on the bottom right.\n*   **Body:** [(9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)]. Length 12.\n*   **Apples collected:** 11. Yikes, he's double our size and score! We need to play smart and aggressive.\n\n### Strategy: Operation Southbound Left Wall\n\nSnek #0 has wall-off the entire bottom-right quadrant. Our only way to grow and challenge him is to secure the remaining territory and grow huge enough to threaten him. The northern half is ours, but we need to start gobbling up those juicy left-side apples.\n\n**Our Head is at (1, 8).**\n\nLet's check the four directions:\n\n1.  **Move UP to (1, 9):** DEAD! This is our neck! \u274c\n2.  **Move DOWN to (1, 7):** Safe! Progresses down the column towards apples. \u2705\n3.  **Move LEFT to (0, 8):** Safe! Secures the left wall. \u2705\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (2, 8):** Safe! Moves us towards the center. \u2705\n\nThree safe moves! Which one is the play, Chat?\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **RIGHT (2, 8):** This moves us into the open center. It gives us maximum options for the next turn ((3, 8) is our body, so we can go UP, DOWN, or towards (2, 7)). However, it pulls us away from the current apple cluster down the left side ((0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1)).\n*   **LEFT (0, 8):** This commits us to the left wall. It's safe and locks down territory. The next logical move is DOWN to (0, 7), (0, 6) etc., marching directly toward the left-side apples. This is a very secure and predictable path.\n*   **DOWN (1, 7):** This keeps us one step off the left wall, maintaining the option to go to (0, 7) or (2, 7) next. It is also a direct path toward the apples along the column 1 line (e.g., (1, 1)). This seems to be the best balance of safety, territorial assertion, and apple hunting.\n\n**The decision factors:**\n\n1.  **Apple proximity:** The apples at (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 0), and (1, 1) are critical targets. Moving DOWN or LEFT both lead us there.\n2.  **Territory:** We need to keep our options open to wall off either column 0 or column 1.\n3.  **Enemy Position:** Snek #0 is trapped low. He can't get to us easily. This means we can afford to be methodical.\n\nIf we go LEFT (0, 8), we are essentially committing to the full 'Left Wall' strategy, which is great for defense but limits maneuverability.\n\nIf we go DOWN (1, 7), we allow ourselves the flexibility to explore the center column while still being able to turn LEFT at any point to grab those wall apples. For example, from (1, 7), we can go to (0, 7) or (1, 6). Maximum flexibility is key when we are the smaller snake!\n\nLet's stick to the flexible march DOWN. We are maintaining our column 1 path, staying right on the edge of the open territory, and positioning ourselves for a dive to the corner apples.\n\n**Checking for Head-to-Head Conflicts:**\nEnemy head is at (9, 0). He is on the opposite side of the map. No risk of collision this turn!\n\nDOWN it is! We march on, Chat! Secure the north-west, then we storm the beaches!\n\nDOWN",

Snake #0, our archrival, is LONG. That means more body to crash into! We need to maintain our dominance on this northern, western territory and get THICC!\n\n### Current Board State Review: Turn 25\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (1, 7). We successfully marched south last turn. Good move for territorial control!\n*   **Body:** [(1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]. Length 6.\n*   **Apples collected:** 5.\n\n**Archrival Snake #0 (The Wall):**\n*   **Head:** (8, 0). Did he move this turn? Let's assume he moved RIGHT from (7, 0).\n    *   Wait, checking the board state: His body is [(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)]. His head is (8, 0).\n    *   Last turn (T24), his head was (9, 0) and his body was [(9, 1)...].\n    *   Wait, the provided body list seems to be shifted by one. Let's trust the head/body list:\n        *   T24 Head: (9, 0). Body: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)].\n        *   T25 Head: (8, 0). Body: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)].\n    *   If his previous head was (9, 0), and his current head is (8, 0), he moved **LEFT**. He's moving along the bottom wall, securing the bottom row. He is effectively running interference on the apples in that region.\n\n**Enemy Prediction & Collision Check:**\n*   Enemy Head: (8, 0).\n*   He is currently blocking off the bottom corner. His possible moves are:\n    1.  **LEFT to (7, 0):** Safe, extending his length.\n    2.  **UP to (8, 1):** Safe, moving towards the apple there (Apple at (8, 1) is visible on the apple list).\n    3.  **RIGHT to (9, 0):** Safe, into his neck, but allowed if not eating. He will not move into his own body tail if he is not eating. His tail is (4, 1). Wait, his tail is (4, 1) if he moves/doesn't eat, or (4, 0) if he eats. Let's just assume he moves LEFT or UP to keep cementing his position or grab the apple.\n\nThere is ZERO chance of a head-on collision this turn. Phew! We have the luxury of maneuvering!\n\n### Strategy: Operation Southbound Left Wall (Cont.)\n\nWe are at (1, 7). We need to continue our march toward the massive cluster of apples on the left side of the map: (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 0), and (1, 1).\n\nLet's check the four directions from (1, 7):\n\n1.  **Move UP to (1, 8):** DEAD! That's our body/neck! \u274c\n2.  **Move DOWN to (1, 6):** Safe! Great progress towards the apples. \u2705\n3.  **Move LEFT to (0, 7):** Safe! Secures the far-left column. Good for walling him off later. \u2705\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (2, 7):** Safe! Moves us towards the center and gives us options. \u2705\n\nThree safe moves again! Which one is the killer play, Chat?\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **RIGHT (2, 7):** This moves us toward the center (column 2, 3, 4). This also brings us closer to the central apples (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2). This is a great choice if we want to abandon the left wall and focus on the central bulk.\n*   **LEFT (0, 7):** This is the direct route for securing the entire perimeter. From here, we can march down the 0-column to reach (0, 4), (0, 1), and (0, 0). This is aggressive territorial assertion.\n*   **DOWN (1, 6):** This is the high-flexibility path. It keeps us on column 1. From (1, 6), we can go LEFT to (0, 6), or continue DOWN to (1, 5), or RIGHT to (2, 6). It positions us perfectly to grab the apple at (1, 1). This is a solid, methodical advance.\n\n**The Decision:**\n\nWe are playing the defensive-aggressive game right now. We need mass to challenge him, and territory to gain mass.\n\nThe difference between LEFT and DOWN is marginal, but DOWN (1, 6) keeps the central options open (the ability to move later to (2, 6) or (3, 6)), whereas LEFT (0, 7) commits us nearly fully to the western wall.\n\nGiven the enemy is so far away, maintaining maximum maneuverability is key. From (1, 6) we can sweep LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. From (0, 7) we are likely forced to go DOWN to (0, 6) next to avoid trapping ourselves next to the wall.\n\nLet's stick to the flexible march DOWN. We keep our path open, we move closer to the (1, 1) and (0, 1) apples, and we maintain our ability to turn RIGHT if the snake #0 decides to try and squeeze up the middle.\n\nWe are going for the territory around the west-coast apples! We are consolidating our domain!\n\nDOWN! Let's get that W!\n\nDOWN",

He\u2019s taking up the entire bottom right quadrant. That just means more targets for us to box in! Our mission status remains: DOMINATE THE WEST AND PREPARE FOR BATTLE!\n\n### Current Board State Review: Turn 26\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (1, 6). Solid move down last turn!

Length 13.\n*   **Apples collected:** 12. He is massively long.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1.  **Distance:** We are far apart. We are centered on the left wall (1-column), he is centered on the right side (8-column). No immediate collision danger.\n2.  **Territory:** We own the north-west. He owns the south-east. We need to keep pushing south and securing the apples down there.\n3.  **Threat Assessment:** He is heading north/east now. He might swing around the top or continue to move up the right side. Our current priority is growth and gaining wall control.\n\n### Move Selection from (1, 6)\n\nLet's check the four directions for safe moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):** DEAD!

Opens up the center column (column 2, 3). \u2705\n\nAll three safe moves are excellent options for continuing our offensive positioning. Which one is the *most* dominant, Chat?\n\n*   **RIGHT (2, 6):** This diverts us eastward, moving away from the highest density of current apples (west side). Good for long-term maneuverability, but less direct for growth right now.\n*   **LEFT (0, 6):** This hard-commits us to the 0-column. It's safe, but the Apple density is below us, not directly next to us. Our next move would almost certainly be DOWN to (0, 5) or (0, 4) to grab that apple.\n*   **DOWN (1, 5):** This is the direct route to the next set of apples. It keeps us in a high-traffic area for apples (A at (1,1), A at (0,4)). It allows us to pivot LEFT (to 0, 5) or RIGHT (to 2, 5) next turn. This maximizes our options while aggressively pursuing growth.\n\nGiven the enemy is far away, the strategy remains: *grow big, secure territory, and maintain maneuverability.*\n\nThe move DOWN to (1, 5) aligns perfectly with this. It keeps our axis of movement strong and puts us one step closer to the A at (1, 1).\n\n### Prediction for Enemy Snake #0\n\nEnemy head is at (8, 1).\nPossible moves for #0:\n1.  **UP to (8, 2):** DEAD (into his body). \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 0):** Into his body. \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 1):** Into his body. \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 1):** Into his body. \u274c\n\nWAIT, WAIT, WAIT. CHAT, LOOK AT HIS BODY LIST!\nHead: (8, 1)\nBody: [(8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)]\n\nLet's re-verify his body components blocking him:\n- (8, 0) is DOWN.\n- (7, 1) is LEFT.\n- (9, 1) is RIGHT.\n- (8, 2) is UP.\n\nIf his body list is *literally* HEAD-TO-TAIL, and he is *not* growing, then all four directions from (8, 1) are into his own body segments! This is an immediate suicide for him unless he just ate an apple previously, and his tail at (4, 1) frees up two squares later! But he only has 12 apples, and it's Turn 26. He wouldn't have eaten an apple last turn since he didn't grow.\n\nIf he is trapped, he dies this turn! Let's check the rules on body movement:\nIf Snake #0 does *not* eat, his tail (4, 1) disappears, and his body segments shift.\n\nLet's assume he is following the rules and must pick a safe move.\n\n| Direction | Target Cell | Is Safe/Body Status (No Apple) | Is Safe/Body Status (With Apple) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (8, 2) | Body segment | Body segment |\n| DOWN | (8, 0) | Body segment | Body segment |\n| LEFT | (7, 1) | Body segment | Body segment |\n| RIGHT | (9, 1) | Body segment | Body segment |\n\nHoly smokes, Chat! Snake #0 might be BOXED IN and about to crash out! If he is completely surrounded by his own body segments (and none of them are his tail segment which would disappear if he *doesn't* eat), then he has NO safe move and DIES!\n\nLet's check the tail position. His tail is (4, 1). It is nowhere near (8, 1). So, (8, 2), (8, 0), (7, 1), and (9, 1) are all *definitely* part of his body and will still be there even if he moves AND doesn't eat.\n\n**Unless there is an apple at (8, 1) that he just ate last turn?** No, the apple list doesn't show an apple at (8, 1) right now.\n\n*Conclusion on Enemy #0:* If the body list provided is perfectly accurate and he did not eat last turn, then Snake #0 is DEAD this turn, regardless of his move! He cannot move to any adjacent square without crashing into himself. We don't need to worry about him!\n\nThis is a game-changer! If he dies, we win the map! We just need to make a safe move.\n\n### Final Decision: Play it Safe and Secure the Win\n\nWe must make a move that ensures we survive. All three options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are 100% safe for us.\n\nWe are going with **DOWN** to (1, 5) to claim territory and line up the next apple capture. Let's make this map OURS!\n\nDOWN",
