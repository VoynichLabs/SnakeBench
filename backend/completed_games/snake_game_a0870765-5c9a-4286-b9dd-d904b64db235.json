While it does push me toward a corner, the board is still large enough that I won't get trapped immediately. The (4, 9) apple is still accessible afterward, and I can maneuver around the board.\n\n**Future Strategy Note:**\nAfter eating the apple at (9, 8), I'll have 3 apples. Next turn, I should move LEFT or DOWN depending on the board situation. The goal is to grab the (4, 9) apple next to build up my score. The enemy is still far away on the left side (at x=1), so I have room to operate in the upper-right quadrant. Focus on collecting the cluster of apples at (4, 9), then work my way to (5, 2) and (0, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

This is strategic progress toward collecting more apples while maintaining distance from the enemy.\n- **LEFT to (6, 9):** Moves me away from my body but keeps me at the top of the board, limiting downward flexibility.\n\nMoving DOWN is superior because:\n1. It positions me to eventually navigate to (6, 1), the closest isolated apple\n2. It gets me away from the top boundary\n3. It keeps me on a path that avoids the enemy snake\n4. It maintains flexibility for future moves\n\n**Long-term Plan (next 5-10 turns):**\n1. Move DOWN toward row 1-3 to collect the apple at (6, 1)\n2. After (6, 1), assess the board - consider moving toward (4, 3) if safe\n3. Monitor enemy snake movements - currently at (4, 6), heading generally southwest\n4. Avoid collision risks with enemy by maintaining distance\n5. Eventually collect apples while staying ahead on score (6-4)\n6. Keep building length advantage through apple collection\n\nDOWN",

I'm only 4 moves away if I continue moving DOWN.\n\nThe enemy snake head is currently at (6, 3). This is problematic! If I move DOWN to (6, 4), the enemy could move DOWN to (6, 2) on the next turn. More critically, if the enemy moves UP from (6, 3), it could reach (6, 4) where I'd be moving, causing a head-on collision!\n\nLet me check possible enemy moves from (6, 3):\n- UP to (6, 4) - This is where I'd be moving DOWN! Head-on collision risk!\n- DOWN to (6, 2) - Moving toward the apple at (6, 1)\n- LEFT to (5, 3) - Into its own body, won't do this\n- RIGHT to (7, 3) - There's an apple there!\n\nThe enemy is well-positioned to either:\n1. Go UP and collide with me\n2. Go DOWN to intercept the (6, 1) apple before me\n3. Go RIGHT to grab the (7, 3) apple\n\nMoving DOWN risks a head-on collision with the enemy if it moves UP. Given that both snakes are competing for apples in similar areas, the enemy might indeed move UP.\n\n**Alternative paths:**\n- LEFT to (5, 5): Moves away from my target but keeps me safe. However, this doesn't advance toward any nearby apples.\n- RIGHT to (7, 5): Moves toward the (7, 3) apple! This could be a good alternative. From (7, 5), I could move DOWN and reach (7, 3) in 2 moves, potentially beating the enemy to that apple.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: the enemy at (6, 3) might go RIGHT to (7, 3) to grab that apple. If I go RIGHT to (7, 5), then DOWN to (7, 4), I'd be adjacent but not conflicting.\n\n**Decision:** Given the collision risk with moving DOWN directly into the enemy's potential path, I should move RIGHT to (7, 5). This keeps me safe, maintains flexibility, and positions me to reach the (7, 3) apple or continue with other options.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**\n- Turn 27: Move RIGHT to (7, 5)\n- Turn 28: Move DOWN toward (7, 3) apple\n- Monitor enemy position; if it moves away from (7, 3), take it. If blocked, reassess and potentially pivot toward (6, 1) or other apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Let me check what moves the enemy might make:\n- UP to (7, 4) - Could collide with me if I move DOWN!\n- DOWN to (7, 2) - Moves toward the (6, 1) apple area\n- LEFT to (6, 3) - Safe for them\n- RIGHT to (8, 3) - Safe for them\n\nKey observation: If I move DOWN to (7, 4) and the enemy moves UP to (7, 4), we have a head-on collision and both die. This is dangerous given we're tied at 6 apples each.\n\n**Evaluating remaining safe moves:**\n\n1. **DOWN to (7, 4)**: Risk of head-on collision with enemy moving UP. The enemy might move UP to intercept or pursue. NOT IDEAL.\n\n2. **UP to (7, 6)**: Moves me away from most apples. Limited strategic value. I'd be moving toward the (5, 2) apple but it's not close. This keeps me safe but doesn't advance toward victory.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (8, 5)**: Moves me to the right edge. This increases distance to all available apples. Not strategic.\n\n**Re-evaluation:**\n\nActually, looking more carefully at apple positions: (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (6, 1), (5, 2)\n\nThe closest reachable apple is (6, 1), which is 4 moves down from (7, 5) if I move DOWN and keep going. However, the enemy at (7, 3) could intercept.\n\nLet me reconsider DOWN more carefully: If the enemy is at (7, 3) and I move to (7, 4), the enemy would need to move UP to (7, 4) to collide. But the enemy might not choose that move. However, it IS a possibility we should avoid if possible.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider UP to (7, 6). From there, I can:\n- Move LEFT to (6, 6) - toward my own body, bad\n- Move DOWN back down\n- Continue UP\n\nThis doesn't really open good paths.\n\n**Decision:** Among the safe moves, DOWN to (7, 4) is most strategically sound despite the collision risk, because:\n1. It directly moves me toward the (6, 1) apple\n2. The enemy is more likely to move LEFT or DOWN rather than UP\n3. If we do collide, we tie at 6 apples and both die - but the game continues with potential for redemption\n\nActually, I need to think about this more carefully. Given the stakes of a tie situation, I should avoid likely collisions. Let me go UP to (7, 6) instead, which keeps my options open for the next move.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Turn 28: Move UP to (7, 6) - safe and buys me time\n- Turn 29: Reassess enemy position and move DOWN or LEFT accordingly\n- Target the (5, 2) or (6, 1) apples depending on enemy movement\n\nUP",

Looking at the board layout, the enemy is moving upward through the middle-right area. Let me consider where the enemy might move:\n- UP to (7, 3) - but that's occupied by their own body, IMPOSSIBLE\n- DOWN to (7, 1) - moving down\n- LEFT to (6, 2) - moving left\n- RIGHT to (8, 2) - moving right\n\nWait, I need to reconsider the enemy body. The enemy body is [(7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)], so (7, 3) is the first segment after the head at (7, 2). The enemy cannot move UP.\n\nClosest apples to me:\n- (5, 2) is 2 squares left and 4 squares down\n- (6, 1) is 1 square left and 5 squares down\n\n**Evaluating remaining safe moves:**\n\n1. **UP to (7, 7)**: Moves me toward the top of the board away from apples. Limits my downward mobility. Not strategic.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (8, 6)**: Moves me right toward the edge. Also moves away from apples. After RIGHT, I could move DOWN to pursue (6, 1) or other apples.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. If I move RIGHT to (8, 6), next turn I can:\n- DOWN to (8, 5) \u2192 (8, 4) \u2192 (8, 3) \u2192 (8, 2) to get close to (6, 1)\n- LEFT to (7, 6) - back to where I was\n- UP to (8, 7)\n\nThe RIGHT move keeps options open for pursuing the (6, 1) apple on the next turn by moving LEFT and DOWN.\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 7), I'm moving away from all apples and limiting my ability to pursue them next turn.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is the more strategic move as it keeps future options open and doesn't waste positioning. From (8, 6), I can maneuver down and left to pursue the (6, 1) apple in the next few turns.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 29: Likely move DOWN from (8, 6) to start pursuing the (6, 1) apple\n- Turn 30+: Continue DOWN and then LEFT to intercept apples while monitoring enemy position\n- Watch for enemy moving right toward (6, 1) as well; if they get closer, consider alternative apple targets like (5, 2)\n\nRIGHT",

Let me evaluate which is better:\n\n- **UP to (6, 5):** This moves me closer to the apple at (6, 7). The apple is directly above in the same column. This is a clear path to a high-value target. Moving up also avoids the enemy snake cluster which is mostly in the lower-left area.\n\n- **LEFT to (5, 4):** This moves me toward the enemy snake. The enemy head is at (4, 2) and has body segments around (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), etc. Moving left puts me closer to this concentration. While not immediately dangerous, it reduces my distance from the enemy.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nThe apple at (6, 7) is isolated and relatively safe to pursue. Moving UP positions me perfectly for a direct approach. The lower apple cluster at (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (3, 2) requires navigating the board more and potentially encountering the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that I'm at (6, 4) and the apple is at (6, 7), moving UP is 3 moves away from the apple with a clear vertical path. This seems like the optimal greedy strategy.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nContinue UP toward (6, 7) to secure that isolated apple. After collecting it, reassess whether to pursue the lower apple cluster or continue farming other available apples based on snake positions.\n\nUP",

Suboptimal.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nLEFT is the obvious choice. I collect the apple at (5, 7) and bring myself to 8 apples, getting within 1 of the enemy. The enemy snake is still in the lower-left area and poses no immediate threat. After this move, I'll be well-positioned near the remaining apples.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**\n- Turn 36 (current): Collect (5, 7) with LEFT \u2192 8 apples\n- Turn 37+: After collecting (5, 7), reassess. The lower-left cluster at (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1) should be pursued next. Also monitor (9, 4) on the right side. Stay aware of enemy snake #1's movements to avoid collisions while maintaining apple-collecting momentum.\n\nLEFT",
