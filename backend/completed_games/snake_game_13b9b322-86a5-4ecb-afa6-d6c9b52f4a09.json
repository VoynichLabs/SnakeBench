Continuing left keeps the shortest path to (1,1). \n\nStrategy next turn: from (2,1), continue LEFT to grab the apple at (1,1), then head UP to collect the apple at (1,2).  \nNext move: LEFT"

That square is now empty (I ate the apple there last turn).  \n\nStrategy for next turns:\nAfter moving DOWN to (0,8), I\u2019ll continue down to (0,7) and then sweep right across row 7 or lower to avoid my own body and reach apples at (4,5), (1,2), and (1,1). I need to navigate around my current body segments clustered on rows 8 and 9.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"
