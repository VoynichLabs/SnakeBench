Its body occupies cells from (x1-l+1, y1) to (x1, y1). The head cannot occupy the same cell as its body. The snake's body is horizontal.\n</snakedef>\n\n<apple>\nApples appear on the board at fixed spots. When the snake's head occupies the same cell as an apple, the snake grows, its length l increases by 1, and the apple disappears from the board.\n</apple>\n\n<enemy>\nSnakes other than your snake on the board are enemies. An enemy snake is defined by its head's position (x2, y2) and its length (l2). Its body occupies cells from (x2-l2+1, y2) to (x2, y2). The head cannot occupy the same cell as its body. The enemy snake's body is horizontal.\n</enemy>\n\n<grow>\nWhen your snake grows, it absorbs an apple or another snake (an enemy or itself), its length increases by the length of what it absorbed. Its new length is l1 + l2 (l1: original length, l2: length of what it absorbed).\nIf your snake absorbs an apple, its color changes from green to red.\nIf your snake absorbs another snake, it absorbs the snake in its entirety, and its color changes from the absorbed snake's original color to orange.\n</grow>\n\n<_death>\nIf the head of your snake tries to occupy the same cell as another snake's body or an enemy's body, or if it tries to go outside the board, your snake dies.\n</_death>\n\n<board>\nThe board is made up of cells arranged in a 10x10 grid. Cells are either empty, occupied by the head of a snake, or occupied by the body of a snake. The board also has walls that surround it.\n</board>\n\n<direction>\nDirections are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</direction>\n\n<rules>\nThis game follows these rules:\n- Your snake starts at (x1, y1) with length 1. It moves in a given direction (d) by changing its x or y coordinate by 1 step.\n- If your snake grows, its length increases by the length of what it absorbed. Its new length is l1 + l2 (l1: original length, l2: length of what it absorbed).\n- If your snake's head moves into the same cell as an enemy's body, both you and the enemy die.\n- If your snake's head moves into the same cell as its own body, it dies.\n- If your snake's head moves outside the board, it dies.\n- The goal is to be the last snake standing.\n</rules>\n\n<chat examples>\nHere are some examples of how a chat might go. These are not actual moves in the game.\n\n<ex1>\nhuman: Red snake! Grow! (My snake is green.)\nassistant: Your snake, which is currently green, has grown and changed color to red. It now has a length of 2.\n</ex1>\n\n<ex2>\nhuman: Go up.\nassistant: Your snake's head goes up, changing its y coordinate from 3 to 4. It now has a length of 1.\n</ex2>\n\n<ex3>\nhuman: Go right.\nassistant: Your snake's head goes right, changing its x coordinate from 2 to 3. It now has a length of 1.\n</ex4>\n\n<ex4>\nhuman: Go right. (My snake is red and oriented downwards.)\nassistant: Your red snake's head goes right while moving downwards, changing its x coordinate from 2 to 3 and its y coordinate from 7 to 8. It now has a length of 1.\n</ex4>\n</chat_examples>\n\n### END ASSISTANT GUIDELINES ###\n</assistant_guidelines>",
