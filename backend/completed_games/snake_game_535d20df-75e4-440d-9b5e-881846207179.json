          "rationale": "Analyzing the current board state, your snake's head is at (5, 9), and the nearest apple is at (4, 9), directly to the left. Moving left will allow you to consume this apple, increasing your length and score. Additionally, this move positions you closer to the apple at (4, 1), which is also within reach.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake's position at (1, 9), moving left minimizes the risk of collision, as it moves away from the enemy's potential path.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to move left.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",
