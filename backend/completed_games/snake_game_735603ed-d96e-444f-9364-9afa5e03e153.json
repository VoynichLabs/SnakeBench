Moving RIGHT is not advantageous because there is no immediate apple to the right and because the board edge is at (9,9). Moving DOWN seems the most direct way to reach the apple at (7,4).\n\nAlso, since our snake has no body segments, there's no risk of self-collision.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go DOWN to get closer to (7,4) and collect the apple in the next turn.\n\nStrategy: Move towards the nearest reachable apple that is accessible without obstacles, prioritizing direct routes.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n- Our snake's head is at (7,6).\n- Our body segment is at (6,6), which is directly to the left.\n  \nSince our last move was LEFT, now moving LEFT again would mean going from (7,6) to (6,6), which is occupied by our own body (body segment at (6,6)). Moving onto ourselves is forbidden\u2014so moving LEFT again is dangerous and will result in death.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n1. **UP (7,7)**:\n   - Is (7,7) safe?\n     - Check surrounding:\n       - No obstacle or body at (7,7).\n     - Moving up from (7,6) is safe.\n   - Is it strategic?\n     - It's away from immediate danger.\n     - It positions us to explore the upper portion.\n   - The apple at (9,6) is to the right, so moving UP isn't directly pursuing an apple but keeps us safe.\n\n2. **RIGHT (8,6)**:\n   - Is (8,6) safe?\n     - From the board, (8,6) appears free, no obstacles.\n   - Moving right progresses toward the apple at (9,6).\n   - Good potential, as it moves toward a nearby apple.\n\n3. **DOWN (7,5)**:\n   - Down from (7,6) to (7,5), which contains a body part:\n     - Our own body at (7,5). Moving down is unsafe.\n\n4. **LEFT** is invalid due to self-collision (already occupied).\n\nSummary:\n\n- Moving left is invalid (occupied by own body).\n- Moving down is unsafe (body).\n- Moving up is safe and positions us higher.\n- Moving right is safe and toward an apple.\n\nGiven our current position and goal of optimizing for apples, moving RIGHT seems the best move because:\n\n- It is safe.\n- It is heading toward the apple at (9,6) \u2014 two steps right.\n- It keeps us in an advantageous position to potentially chase other apples.\n\nNext turn, I will plan to monitor the position after moving right, perhaps planning to move up or right further, while avoiding snakes and walls.\n\n**Decided move: RIGHT**"

Let's evaluate the possible moves:\n\n1. **UP to (7, 7):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Opens up access to the apple at **(2, 8)** over subsequent moves.\n     - Increases vertical space, providing more maneuverability.\n     - Keeps a safe distance from the enemy snake at **(0, 4)**.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - No immediate apple to collect in this direction.\n     - Moving away from the apple at **(9, 6)**, which is nearby.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 5):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Moves closer to the lower apple at **(4, 3)** over time.\n     - Keeps horizontal space open for future rightward movements.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - No immediate apple to collect.\n     - Potentially leads away from the apple at **(9, 6)**.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 6):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Revisiting the previous position could position the snake for strategic movements.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Immediate collision with my own body segment at **(6, 6)**, resulting in death.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 6):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Continues towards the apple at **(9, 6)**, allowing for immediate point gain in the next move.\n     - Maintains a direct path towards the wall on the right, which could be advantageous if timed correctly.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Approaching the wall increases the risk of getting trapped if not carefully navigated in subsequent moves.\n     - Limited space on the right side, potentially reducing maneuverability.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nWhile moving **RIGHT** towards **(8, 6)** keeps me on a path to collect the nearby apple at **(9, 6)**, it also brings me closer to the wall, which could limit future movement options. Moving **UP** to **(7, 7)**, on the other hand, opens up more vertical space and positions me closer to another apple at **(2, 8)** without immediate risks.\n\nConsidering the balance between immediate point gain and long-term maneuverability, moving **UP** provides a safer and more strategic positioning, allowing for flexibility in future moves and access to multiple apples.\n\n**Next Move:** UP"
