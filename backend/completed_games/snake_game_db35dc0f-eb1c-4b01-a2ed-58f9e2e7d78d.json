Now I need to consider which is best:\n\n- **DOWN to (6, 4)**: Moves toward the lower part of the board. No immediate apple nearby. Could move me closer to (5, 1) area eventually, but that's now occupied by enemy snake #0.\n\n- **LEFT to (5, 5)**: Moves closer to apple at (5, 6), which is just one square up. This positions me to grab (5, 6) next turn easily. Good strategic move.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7, 5)**: Moves toward apple at (9, 6). This is reachable but requires more moves. Takes me away from the closer apple at (5, 6).\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT to (5, 5) is the best move because:\n1. It's safe\n2. It positions me directly below the apple at (5, 6)\n3. I can easily collect that apple next turn\n4. It keeps me in a central position with good access to multiple apples\n5. The apple at (5, 6) is the closest reachable apple\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 14: Move UP to (5, 6) and collect the apple (my 5th apple)\n- Then reassess based on remaining apple positions and enemy location\n- Continue targeting the apples at (1, 6), (1, 3), (0, 3) as they become accessible\n- Monitor enemy snake position to avoid collisions\n\nLEFT",
