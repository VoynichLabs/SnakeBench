My current position is close to the apple at (6, 2), but I need to be careful not to run into Snake #2 at (7, 3).\n\nMy next move should be to move towards the apple at (6, 2) without colliding with Snake #2. I can do this by moving down to (6, 3) and then down again to (6, 2).\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll try to move towards the apple at (5, 5) after collecting the apple at (6, 2).\n\nNext move: DOWN."

The closest apple is at (6, 2), which is just one position to the left and down from our current position. However, there's also an apple at (0, 5) and (0, 7) which are quite far away.\n\nSince we are close to the apple at (6, 2), I think it's a good idea to move towards it. However, we need to be careful because there's an enemy snake at position (7, 4) which is just one position above us.\n\nTo avoid the enemy snake, I think it's best to move left first and then down. This way, we can avoid a potential collision with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue moving towards the apple at (6, 2) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"
