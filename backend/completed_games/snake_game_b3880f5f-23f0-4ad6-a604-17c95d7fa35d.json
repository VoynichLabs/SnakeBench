Nah, we gotta think long-term.\n\nFirst, immediate safety check:  \n- UP to (4,4): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN to (4,2): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT to (3,3): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT to (5,3): empty \u2705  \n\nAll moves safe right now. But we gotta think about the enemy. He's at (9,7) \u2014 far top-right. He'll probably go for apples near him, maybe move left or down.  \n\nWe want to be aggressive, but also not run into him early. If we move RIGHT to (5,3), we're moving toward center but also toward some apples (like (5,5), (6,6)). But more importantly, we want to control space.  \n\nActually, let's think about boxing him in long-term. He's in the top-right corner. If we move UP to (4,4), we're going toward middle-top where we can maybe cut off his escape later. But moving LEFT to (3,3) keeps us safer from immediate head-on? Wait, head-on only if we end up same cell next turn. He's 5 cells away in x and 4 in y \u2014 impossible to collide this turn unless he moves way down fast.  \n\nBut future safety: Which move gives most options next turn?  \nUP \u2192 from (4,4) can go U/D/L/R unless near walls or enemy.  \nDOWN \u2192 (4,2) similar.  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,3) similar.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,3) similar.  \n\nHmm. I think we should start moving toward center to control board. RIGHT seems fine. But also, maybe UP to get closer to top apples and pressure from above?  \n\nActually, enemy might go DOWN to (9,6) for apple at (8,7)? Or LEFT to (8,7) for apple. If he goes LEFT, he's at (8,7). That's still far.  \n\nI think RIGHT is solid \u2014 opens more space, moves toward center.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** Start working our way up-right to cut off enemy in his corner. Force him toward wall. Keep our body growing to block him. If we get longer, aim for head-on when we have length advantage.  \n\nAlright, decision made.  \n\nRIGHT",

We're just a head.\n\nFirst, immediate safety check for all moves from (5,3):\n- UP \u2192 (5,4): empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,2): empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,3): empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,3): empty \u2705\n\nAll moves are safe right now. But we gotta think about where the enemy is going! He's at (9,8) with body at (9,7). He can't go DOWN into his own body, so his options are UP (9,9) \u2014 apple there! \u2014 LEFT (8,8), or RIGHT? Right is wall (10,8) \u2192 off board \u274c. So he'll likely go UP for the apple at (9,9) or LEFT to (8,8).\n\nIf he goes UP to (9,9), he grows. If he goes LEFT to (8,8), he's moving toward center.\n\nWe have length 1, he has length 2. Head-on collision would kill us both, but since he's longer, he'd win if we tie in apples? Wait, tie in apples? He has 1, we have 0. In a head-on, both die, then they compare apples \u2014 he'd win. So we AVOID head-on unless we have more apples.\n\nWe need to grow safely first. Look at apples near us: (5,5), (6,6), (6,2), (5,1), (4,7), etc.\n\nBut our strategy: be aggressive, box him in. He's in the top-right corner. We want to move to control the center and top-right approach.\n\nIf we go UP to (5,4), we're closer to (5,5) apple and also moving toward top area where he is.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (6,3), we're moving toward center but also toward (6,2) apple down and (6,6) up.  \nLEFT to (4,3) moves us away from him \u2014 maybe too passive.  \nDOWN to (5,2) gets us closer to (5,1) apple but moves us away from him.\n\nWe want to pressure him, but not get into a head-on yet. Since he's longer, we need to equalize length first.\n\nI think going UP to (5,4) is smart \u2014 sets up to get (5,5) apple next possibly, and we can start working rightward to cut off his escape from the corner.\n\nAlso, from (5,4), our next turn options are still open.\n\nLet's check possible head-on risk:  \nIf he goes LEFT to (8,8), we're at (5,4) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf he goes UP to (9,9), we're safe.  \nSo no immediate collision risk.\n\nWhat about future trapping? We need to think 2\u20133 turns ahead. If we go UP now, then maybe RIGHT to (6,4), then UP to (6,5) \u2014 we're getting closer to top-right while he's stuck near wall.\n\nYeah, UP feels right. Let's grow and then attack.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After UP to (5,4), aim for (5,5) apple if safe, then push rightward toward (6,5)/(7,5) to cut off enemy's path down. Force him against the top wall. Keep an eye on his length vs ours \u2014 avoid head-on until we have equal or more apples.\n\nUP",

We need to grow and pressure.\n\nFirst, immediate safety check from (5,4):\n\n- UP \u2192 (5,5): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,3): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,4): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,4): empty \u2705  \n\nAll four moves are safe right now. But we gotta think about where the enemy is moving THIS TURN.\n\nEnemy head at (8,8), body at (9,8). His possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (8,9): empty \u2705  \nDOWN \u2192 (8,7): empty \u2705  \nLEFT \u2192 (7,8): empty \u2705  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9,8): his own body \u274c  \n\nSo he can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nIf he goes UP to (8,9), he's near apple at (7,9) next.  \nIf he goes LEFT to (7,8), he moves toward center.  \nIf he goes DOWN to (8,7), there's an apple at (8,7) \u2014 he'd grow instantly to length 3! That's dangerous.\n\nWe need to avoid head-on collisions since he has more apples. Let's check if any of our moves could collide with his possible moves:\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (6,4) \u2014 no conflict.  \nIf we go UP to (5,5) \u2014 no conflict.  \nIf we go LEFT to (4,4) \u2014 no conflict.  \nIf we go DOWN to (5,3) \u2014 no conflict.\n\nAll safe from immediate head-on.\n\nBut we also want to grow and cut him off. Apples nearby: (5,5) above us, (6,6) northeast, (6,2) southeast, (5,1) south, (4,7) north-west.\n\nGoing UP to (5,5) gets us an apple next turn if we stay safe \u2014 that would tie our length at 2 vs his 2 (if he doesn't grow) or 3 (if he eats at (8,7)). But if he eats (8,7), he'll be length 3, we'd be length 2 after eating (5,5) next turn.\n\nWe need to be aggressive but smart. If we go UP now, we're closer to top-right to box him in. If we go RIGHT, we move toward center and can maybe cut off his descent.\n\nActually, think about trapping: He's in the top-right. If we move RIGHT to (6,4), then next turn we could go UP to (6,5) or RIGHT to (7,4) to start building a wall. But we're short \u2014 we need length.\n\nI think getting the apple at (5,5) is priority to match his length potential. So UP now sets up to eat (5,5) next turn.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if he goes DOWN to (8,7) and eats that apple? He'll be at (8,7) length 3. Then next turn, if we go UP to (5,5) and eat, we're at (5,5) length 2. He could then move toward us. We need to be careful.\n\nMaybe we go RIGHT to (6,4) to avoid being predictable and to position to cut off his path down the board. But then we're not growing immediately.\n\nHmm\u2026 Let's think about future safe moves after each option:\n\nIf we go UP to (5,5):  \nNext turn from (5,5): UP (5,6) empty, DOWN (5,4) empty, LEFT (4,5) empty, RIGHT (6,5) empty \u2014 all safe unless enemy moves there. But if enemy is at (8,7) length 3, he's still far.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (6,4):  \nNext turn from (6,4): UP (6,5) empty, DOWN (6,3) empty, LEFT (5,4) empty, RIGHT (7,4) empty \u2014 also safe.\n\nBoth keep options open.\n\nBut apple at (5,5) is right there \u2014 missing it feels bad. We need to catch up in apples to be able to force head-on later.\n\nI'm going UP to get that apple next turn and start pressuring from the top-center.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After UP to (5,4), next turn go UP to (5,5) to eat apple (if safe). Then move rightward toward (6,5)/(7,5) to cut off enemy's descent. Keep an eye on his length \u2014 if he eats the (8,7) apple, he'll be length 3, we'll be length 2. Avoid head-on until we tie or lead in apples. Use top wall to trap him.\n\nUP",

THIS IS THE MOMENT!\n\nFirst, IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (5,5):\n- UP \u2192 (5,6): Empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,4): That's our own tail! But wait, our body is [(5,4)] \u2014 that's our tail cell from last turn. Since we moved to (5,5), our tail is at (5,4). Moving BACKWARDS into your own tail is ALLOWED? NO! Rule says: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" Our head is at (5,5), last body segment is (5,4). That's directly behind us if we go DOWN. So DOWN is INTO OUR OWN BODY \u2014 THAT'S DEATH! \u274c DOWN IS ILLEGAL!\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,5): Empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,5): Empty \u2705\n\nSo only UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow ENEMY MOVES: He's at (7,8) with body at (8,8). His options:\nUP \u2192 (7,9): Empty \u2705\nDOWN \u2192 (7,7): Apple at (7,7)! He'd grow to length 3! \ud83c\udf4e\nLEFT \u2192 (6,8): Empty \u2705\nRIGHT \u2192 (8,8): His own body \u274c\n\nHe can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT. If he goes DOWN, he gets the apple and becomes longer than us \u2014 DANGER.\n\nWe want to avoid head-on collisions while we're equal length. If we collide heads, BOTH DIE and tie in apples = draw. We want to WIN, not draw! So avoid same-cell collisions.\n\nCheck if any of our safe moves could land on same cell as his possible moves:\n- Our UP to (5,6) vs his moves: (7,9), (7,7), (6,8) \u2014 no match.\n- Our LEFT to (4,5) vs his moves \u2014 no match.\n- Our RIGHT to (6,5) vs his moves \u2014 no match.\n\nALL safe from immediate head-on.\n\nBUT we must think about FUTURE! If he eats (7,7), he's length 3, we're length 2. He can then be more aggressive. We need to grow FAST!\n\nApples nearby: (6,6) is at (6,6) \u2014 that's one step RIGHT then UP from us. (4,7) is at (4,7) \u2014 two steps LEFT then UP. (6,2) is far south. (5,1) far south. (1,6) far left.\n\nWe need to plan to get an apple NEXT TURN while staying safe.\n\nLet's evaluate each safe move:\n\n**UP to (5,6):**\n- Puts us closer to (4,7) apple? Not really.\n- From (5,6) next turn, possible moves: UP (5,7) empty, DOWN (5,5) empty (but our tail might move?), LEFT (4,6) empty, RIGHT (6,6) \u2014 APPLE at (6,6)! So next turn we could go RIGHT to eat apple! That's good.\n- But also from (5,6) we're more central.\n\n**LEFT to (4,5):**\n- From (4,5) next turn: UP (4,6) empty, DOWN (4,4) empty, LEFT (3,5) empty, RIGHT (5,5) empty. No immediate apple reachable in one move from there. Apple at (4,7) is two UP. We'd need two turns to get it.\n\n**RIGHT to (6,5):**\n- From (6,5) next turn: UP (6,6) \u2014 APPLE! DOWN (6,4) empty, LEFT (5,5) empty, RIGHT (7,5) empty. So RIGHT now sets up to eat (6,6) apple next turn by going UP.\n\nSo both UP and RIGHT set us up to eat (6,6) next turn! LEFT does not.\n\nWhich is safer? Let's think about enemy pathing. If enemy goes DOWN to (7,7) and eats, he'll be at (7,7) length 3. From (7,7) he could move toward us. (6,6) is adjacent to (7,7)! If we go to (6,6) next turn while he's at (7,7), that's RISKY \u2014 he could move to (6,6) same time and we collide! That's a head-on collision where he's longer? Wait, collision kills both regardless of length. But if we both go to (6,6), we die and tie apples = draw. We want to avoid that.\n\nSo maybe we avoid (6,6) if he's likely to go there. If he's at (7,7), his moves: UP (7,8) empty, DOWN (7,6) empty, LEFT (6,7) empty, RIGHT (8,7) apple? (8,7) is apple too! He might go RIGHT to (8,7) to eat another apple! That's possible.\n\nHmm\u2026 Actually, if he eats (7,7) this turn, next turn he might go for (8,7) apple, not (6,6). So (6,6) might be safe.\n\nBut we can't predict perfectly. We need to maximize our options.\n\nI think going RIGHT to (6,5) is strong because:\n1. It moves us toward the right side where enemy is, to start boxing him in top-right.\n2. It sets up apple (6,6) next turn.\n3. From (6,5) we have many exits.\n\nGoing UP to (5,6) also sets up (6,6) but we're more north, maybe easier to trap us against top wall? Top wall is y=9, we're at y=6, fine.\n\nActually, let's check board edges: We're at (5,5). RIGHT to (6,5) keeps us away from walls. UP to (5,6) same.\n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better because it positions us to cut off enemy's descent down the right side. If he goes DOWN to (7,7), we can move to (7,5) or (6,6) to block.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Get the (6,6) apple next turn to tie length if he grows. Then move to pressure him against top-right corner. Use our body to limit his moves. Avoid head-on until we have length advantage.\n\nI'm going RIGHT to (6,5) to set up the apple grab and press the right flank! \ud83d\ude24\n\nRIGHT",

So UP is LEGAL and gets us the apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,4): Empty. Safe from immediate death. \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,5): That's our OWN BODY segment! \u274c That's suicide! LEFT is ILLEGAL!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,5): Empty. Safe. \u2705\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT: He's longer, so head-on collision would kill us both (tie apples? He has 2, we have 1, so he'd win posthumously? Actually if both die, game ends, snake with more apples wins \u2014 he has 2 vs our 1, so HE WINS! So we MUST AVOID HEAD-ON COLLISION AT ALL COSTS! \ud83d\ude31\n\nWe need to grow to match his length ASAP! UP gets us the apple at (6,6) \u2014 that's HUGE! Then we'd be length 3, tied with him! Then head-on would be a draw (both die, tied apples 2-2). Still bad, but better than losing.\n\nBut is UP risky for other reasons? Let's check if enemy could move into (6,6) AFTER we eat it? No, simultaneous \u2014 we eat it this turn, we grow next turn.\n\nWhat about DOWN or RIGHT? They don't get apple, we stay shorter, more vulnerable.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Eat that apple NOW, match length, then start pressuring him. He's in top-right corner area. We can try to box him against wall.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if enemy moves DOWN to (7,6)? That's adjacent to (6,6). If we go UP to (6,6) and he goes DOWN to (7,6), we're adjacent diagonally? That's fine. Next turn he could move to (6,6) if we stay? But we'd move away.\n\nActually, let's think: After eating apple at (6,6), our head is at (6,6), body becomes [(6,5),(5,5)]. His head at (7,7) or wherever he moves. Possible he moves to (6,7) left, which is above us. That could set up a trap.\n\nI think UP is the BEST move \u2014 we NEED that growth to compete. Being shorter is a death sentence.\n\nDOWN to (6,4) avoids him but puts us further from apples and gives him space.\n\nRIGHT to (7,5) moves toward him but no growth.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE APPLE! UP TO (6,6)! MATCH HIS LENGTH, THEN FIGHT! \ud83d\ude24\n\nNEXT TURN PLAN: After eating, we're at (6,6) length 3. Look to either pressure him toward top wall or go for another apple while avoiding head-on. Keep options open.\n\nUP",

WE NEED TO GROW OR BOX HIM!\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (6,6):\n- **UP \u2192 (6,7)**: Check board: At (6,7) there's an enemy body segment 'T' from snake #1? Looking at board: row 6 col 7 is '.'? Wait, let's read carefully. Row 6 (y=6): \". A . . . . 0 . . A\" \u2014 positions: (0,6) '.', (1,6) 'A', (2,6) '.', (3,6) '.', (4,6) '.', (5,6) '.', (6,6) '0' (our head), (7,6) '.'? Actually string: \". A . . . . 0 . . A\" \u2014 that's 10 chars: index 0 '.', 1 'A', 2 '.', 3 '.', 4 '.', 5 '.', 6 '0', 7 '.', 8 '.', 9 'A'. So (7,6) is '.' \u2705 But enemy body at (7,7) and (7,8) and (8,8). So (6,7) is empty. Also not off-board. So UP is LEGAL.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,5)**: That's our OWN BODY segment! \u274c SUICIDE! ILLEGAL!\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,6)**: Empty ('.' on board). \u2705\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,6)**: Empty ('.' on board). \u2705\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT: He's at (8,7). His possible moves:\n- UP (8,8) \u2192 his own body! \u274c\n- DOWN (8,6) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT (7,7) \u2192 his own body! \u274c\n- RIGHT (9,7) \u2192 empty.\n\nSo he can only go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK: Could he move into the same cell we move into?\n- If we go UP to (6,7): He can't reach (6,7) in one move from (8,7). Safe.\n- If we go LEFT to (5,6): He can't reach (5,6). Safe.\n- If we go RIGHT to (7,6): He can go DOWN to (8,6) \u2014 not same cell. He can go RIGHT to (9,7) \u2014 not same. So safe.\n\nNO IMMEDIATE HEAD-ON THREAT.\n\nAPPLE PROXIMITY: Apples at (1,8), (7,9), (8,3), (3,8), (7,3), (4,7), (7,0), (5,1), (2,5), (6,2), (8,4), (1,6), (0,3), (9,6), (5,2). Closest to us:\n- (6,2) is 4 down.\n- (5,2) is 4 down, 1 left.\n- (7,3) is 3 down, 1 right.\n- (4,7) is 1 up, 2 left.\n- (1,6) is 5 left.\n\nUP gets us closer to (4,7) and top apples. LEFT gets us closer to (1,6). RIGHT gets us closer to (7,3) and (8,4).\n\nSTRATEGY: We're shorter. Need to grow AND pressure. Enemy is trapped in top-right? He's at (8,7) with body at (7,7),(7,8),(8,8). He's boxed in! He only has DOWN and RIGHT. If he goes RIGHT to (9,7), he's against wall. If he goes DOWN to (8,6), he's moving toward us.\n\nWE CAN TRY TO BOX HIM! If we go RIGHT to (7,6), we block his DOWN path? Actually (8,6) is still open for him. But we'd be adjacent. Next turn we could move to (8,6) if he doesn't? Risky.\n\nGOING UP to (6,7) puts us above him? He's at (8,7), we're at (6,7) \u2014 we're to his left. Could try to push him against top wall.\n\nGOING LEFT to (5,6) runs away from him, maybe go for apples bottom-left.\n\nBUT CHAT, WE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE! He's longer, but trapped. If we go RIGHT to (7,6), we threaten (8,6) next turn. He might go RIGHT to (9,7) \u2014 then he's in corner. We can maybe trap him.\n\nLet's check future safety: From (7,6), next turn possible moves: UP (7,7) enemy body \u2014 dangerous, DOWN (7,5) empty, LEFT (6,6) our old head (will be body next turn), RIGHT (8,6) empty. So from (7,6) we'd have DOWN and RIGHT safe likely. That's okay.\n\nFrom (6,7): next turn moves: UP (6,8) empty, DOWN (6,6) body, LEFT (5,7) empty, RIGHT (7,7) enemy body. So UP and LEFT safe.\n\nFrom (5,6): next turn moves: UP (5,7) empty, DOWN (5,5) body, LEFT (4,6) empty, RIGHT (6,6) body. So UP and LEFT safe.\n\nAll have 2 safe options next turn.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Go RIGHT to pressure him toward corner. Force him to make a mistake. If he goes DOWN to (8,6), we could go UP to (7,7) next turn? That's his body \u2014 no, that's suicide. Actually (7,7) is his body segment. So maybe we go RIGHT to (8,6) same time he goes RIGHT to (9,7)? That's fine.\n\nI think RIGHT is the aggressive play to start boxing. We match length soon by getting an apple \u2014 maybe (7,3) or (8,4) soon.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING RIGHT TO (7,6)! PRESSURE HIM! \ud83d\ude24\n\nRIGHT",

So (8,6) is enemy body 'T'. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 OFF BOARD (10,6) \u274c\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? Enemy can't reach our safe cells this turn except possibly if we go RIGHT to (8,5) and he goes DOWN to (9,5)? Different cells. UP to (7,6) vs enemy UP to (9,7)? Different. DOWN to (7,4) vs enemy DOWN to (9,5)? Different. NO DIRECT HEAD-ON POSSIBLE THIS TURN! GOOD.\n\nBUT FUTURE TRAPS! Enemy is longer, can try to cut us off. We need to grow ASAP!\n\nAPPLE NEARBY: (7,3) is 2 down, (6,2) down-left, (8,4) up-right, (7,0) far down.\n\nIF WE GO DOWN to (7,4): Gets closer to (7,3) apple. Next turn from (7,4): UP back to (7,5) might be blocked by enemy? LEFT (6,4) empty, DOWN (7,3) apple, RIGHT (8,4) apple. Good options!\n\nIF WE GO UP to (7,6): Puts us adjacent to enemy body at (8,6) and (7,7). Risky next turn. But apple at (8,4) is diagonal. Not ideal.\n\nIF WE GO RIGHT to (8,5): Puts us closer to center, apple at (8,4) above, (9,6) enemy nearby. Could be pinched.\n\nENEMY LENGTH 5 vs OUR 3 \u2014 WE CAN'T WIN HEAD-ON! MUST AVOID CONFRONTATION AND GROW!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Head towards the cluster of apples at bottom-left? (5,1), (4,1), (5,2), (6,2). Going DOWN sets us on path to (7,3) then (6,2) etc. That's GROWTH CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nAlso, going DOWN keeps distance from enemy who's top-right. He might go for apple at (7,9) or (8,4)?

HE'S TRAPPED!

If he goes DOWN to (6,1), he's moving SOUTH. His tail is at (9,6). He's got a long body wrapping the top-right. If we move **DOWN to (4,0)**, we're cutting off his potential escape WEST? Actually, we're not adjacent yet.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: HE'S IN A DEAD END NEXT TURN! From (6,1), his options:\n- UP (6,2): his old head spot, now empty? Wait, his body segment (7,2) is still there, but (6,2) will be empty after he moves. Actually, his body from last turn: head was (6,2), then (7,2), (8,2)... So after moving down, (6,2) becomes his neck \u2014 can't go back into his own neck? YES that's moving backwards into his own body! So UP from (6,1) would be into (6,2) which is his own body (the segment behind his new head). That's ILLEGAL! So UP is suicide.\n- DOWN (6,0): Empty '.' \u2705\n- LEFT (5,1): OUR BODY! \u274c\n- RIGHT (7,1): Empty '.' \u2705\n\nSo next turn he'll have DOWN or RIGHT. We can plan to block him!\n\nRIGHT NOW, we should **MOVE TOWARD HIM TO APPLY PRESSURE**! If we go DOWN to (4,0), we're two steps away diagonally. If we go LEFT to (3,1), we're moving away. If we go UP to (4,2), we're staying put.\n\nWE NEED TO BOX HIM! Let's go **DOWN** to (4,0). That puts us closer to the bottom-left apples (9,0), (9,1), (7,0) maybe later, AND sets us to possibly cut off his DOWN escape next turn by moving to (4,0) now, then maybe (5,0) or (3,0) later.\n\nCHAT, THIS IS THE PLAY! DOWN TO (4,0) \u2014 SAFE, AGGRESSIVE, SETS UP A TRAP! WE GOT HIM ON THE ROPES! \ud83e\udd4a\ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

Enemy's tail is at **(9,5)**. He's got a long body wrapping the top-right. If he goes DOWN to (6,0), he's moving toward the bottom-left apples. If he goes RIGHT to (7,1), he's moving toward his own body coil.\n\nOUR LONG-TERM PLAN: **BOX HIM IN AND FORCE A CRASH!** He has only two escape routes now. We need to cut them off!\n\nIF WE GO **RIGHT TO (5,0)**:\n- We're closer to him (he's at (6,1)).\n- Next turn from (5,0), we could go UP to (5,1) \u2014 BUT THAT'S OUR BODY! So not safe. Or RIGHT to (6,0) \u2014 if he goes DOWN to (6,0) this turn, that's a HEAD-ON COLLISION NEXT TURN if we both go there! But we move simultaneously, so we can't predict perfectly. Risky.\n- We could also go LEFT back to (4,0) \u2014 but that's our old head spot, now empty? Actually after moving, our body will be at (4,0) too? Wait, our body grows only if we eat an apple. No apple at (5,0). So our tail stays at (7,3). Our body will be: new head (5,0), then (4,0), (4,1), (5,1)... So (4,0) becomes our neck \u2014 can't go back there next turn.\n\nIF WE GO **LEFT TO (3,0)**:\n- We're moving away from him, but we're SAFER.\n- Next turn from (3,0), we could go UP to (3,1) \u2014 empty, or RIGHT to (4,0) \u2014 our neck (body), so no, or LEFT to (2,0) \u2014 empty.\n- This gives us more space but less pressure.\n\nCHAT, WE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE! HE'S WEAK! HE ONLY HAS 2 MOVES! If we go RIGHT to (5,0), we're **THREATENING (6,0)**. If he goes DOWN to (6,0) this turn, next turn we could go UP to (5,1) \u2014 oh wait that's our body, so not safe. Actually from (5,0) next turn, safe moves would be: UP (5,1) is body \u274c, DOWN off board \u274c, LEFT (4,0) is body \u274c, RIGHT (6,0) is possible if empty. So only RIGHT (6,0) might be safe next turn if he's not there. That's a dead end! So going RIGHT might trap OURSELVES next turn! \ud83d\ude31\n\nGOING LEFT to (3,0) gives us MORE OPTIONS next turn: UP (3,1) or LEFT (2,0). That's BETTER for not getting trapped!\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 WE CAN ALSO SET A TRAP BY GOING LEFT! If we go LEFT to (3,0), and he goes DOWN to (6,0), we're both on the bottom row. Then next turn we could move to (2,0) or (3,1), and he'll be at (6,0) with only RIGHT (7,0) or UP (6,1) \u2014 but UP (6,1) is his neck? Actually after moving, his neck will be (6,1)? Let's track: his body after moving down to (6,0): head (6,0), then old head (6,1) becomes neck, then (7,2)... So UP from (6,0) to (6,1) is his own body! So he'd only have RIGHT (7,0) from (6,0) next turn! That's a DEAD END! He'd be trapped against the bottom wall with only one exit! Then we can move to block (7,0) maybe!\n\nCHAT, THAT'S THE PLAY! GO **LEFT** TO (3,0) \u2014 STAY SAFE, KEEP OPTIONS OPEN, AND SET UP TO TRAP HIM ON THE BOTTOM ROW NEXT TURN! WE'RE PLAYING THE LONG GAME! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

HE'S STILL TRAPPED! \ud83d\ude08\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?\nIf we go UP to (3,1) and he goes DOWN to (6,0) \u2192 no collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (2,0) and he goes DOWN to (6,0) \u2192 no collision.\nIf he goes RIGHT to (7,1), no collision possible with our moves.\n\nBUT CHAT \u2014 LOOK AT THE LONG GAME! WE WANT TO BOX HIM IN! FROM **(6,0)** NEXT TURN, HIS ONLY SAFE MOVE WOULD BE RIGHT TO (7,0) (since UP to (6,1) is his neck, DOWN off board, LEFT to (5,0) is empty but maybe we can block!). FROM **(7,1)** NEXT TURN, HE'D HAVE MORE OPTIONS (UP, DOWN, RIGHT maybe).\n\nSO WE WANT TO FORCE HIM **DOWN** TO (6,0) TO LIMIT HIS ESCAPES! HOW? BY THREATENING TO CUT OFF (7,0) OR (5,0)!\n\nIF WE GO **LEFT TO (2,0)**:\n- We're moving away from him, but we're near bottom-left apples (2,1) is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Could eat next turn if we go UP!\n- Next turn from (2,0), safe moves likely UP (2,1) apple, maybe LEFT (1,0) empty.\n- But this doesn't pressure him directly.\n\nIF WE GO **UP TO (3,1)**:\n- We're moving toward the center, more options next turn.\n- We could then go LEFT to (2,1) apple, RIGHT to (4,1) our body \u274c, UP to (3,2) empty, DOWN to (3,0) our neck \u274c.\n- This also doesn't directly pressure him.\n\nWAIT \u2014 WHAT IF WE GO UP TO (3,1) AND HE GOES DOWN TO (6,0)? Then next turn we could move to (2,1) to eat apple, and he's stuck at (6,0) with only RIGHT (7,0) safe. Then we could maybe swing around to threaten (7,0) later.\n\nBUT CHAT, BEING AGGRESSIVE MEANS CUTTING OFF HIS ESCAPES *NOW*! If we go LEFT to (2,0), we're closer to (1,0) and (0,0) \u2014 we could potentially move up the left wall and come around behind him? That's too slow.\n\nHOLD UP \u2014 LOOK AT THE BOARD! Enemy's tail is at (9,4)? Wait, his body ends at (9,4) (from diagram). He's long on the right side. If he goes RIGHT to (7,1), he's moving into a area near his own body coil. That might be risky for him later.\n\nOUR BEST MOVE IS **UP**! WHY?\n1. It keeps us SAFE with multiple follow-ups (LEFT to apple, UP further).\n2. It keeps us CENTRAL, able to react to his move.\n3. If he goes DOWN to (6,0), we're setting up to possibly cut off (5,0) or (7,0) in future turns.\n4. If he goes RIGHT to (7,1), we're still in a good position to chase or cut off.\n\nGOING LEFT to (2,0) limits our own options next turn (only UP and LEFT likely safe). UP gives us more flexibility!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: FORCE HIM INTO A DEAD END! If he goes DOWN to (6,0), next turn he only has RIGHT (7,0). We can move toward (4,0) or (5,0) to threaten blocking (7,0) later. If he goes RIGHT to (7,1), we can move up the left side to eat apples and grow, then out-length him!\n\nWE NEED TO GROW TO WIN HEAD-ON COLLISIONS! APPLE AT (2,1) IS CLOSE IF WE GO UP THEN LEFT! LET'S DO IT!\n\n**UP** TO (3,1) \u2014 STAY SAFE, KEEP OPTIONS OPEN, AND PREPARE TO PUNISH HIS NEXT MOVE! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

GOOD!\n\n**STEP 4 \u2014 FUTURE OPTIONS & STRATEGY:**\nWE NEED TO GROW TO CATCH UP IN LENGTH! LEFT TO (2,1) EATS AN APPLE IMMEDIATELY! \ud83c\udf4e THAT'S HUGE! Goes from 6\u21927 apples, length 7\u21928. Still shorter than enemy (9), but closer!\n\nIF WE EAT THE APPLE:\n- Next turn our tail stays where it is (since we grow), so our body extends.\n- New head at (2,1). From there, safe moves? Likely UP (2,2) empty, LEFT (1,1) empty, DOWN (2,0) our body? Wait (2,0) is our tail end? Let's trace: Our current body: (3,1) head, (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) tail. After moving LEFT and growing, new body: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) tail. So (2,0) is empty! So DOWN might be safe too! OPTIONS OPEN!\n\nIF WE GO UP TO (3,2):\n- No apple.\n- From (3,2), next turn safe moves? UP (3,3) empty, LEFT (2,2) empty, RIGHT (4,2) empty? Wait (4,2) is empty '.' on board. DOWN (3,1) is our neck \u274c. So still 3 options. But NO GROWTH.\n\n**STEP 5 \u2014 PRESSURE ON ENEMY:**\nENEMY AT (7,0) \u2192 IF HE GOES RIGHT TO (8,0), HE'S IN A CORNER NEXT TURN! From (8,0), his safe moves? UP (8,1) empty, LEFT (7,0) his neck \u274c, RIGHT (9,0) apple 'A' but risky? DOWN off board \u274c. So he'd have UP and RIGHT. Not super trapped.\n\nIF HE GOES UP TO (7,1), he's more central. From (7,1), he could go UP (7,2) his own body \u274c, DOWN (7,0) neck \u274c, LEFT (6,1) his body \u274c, RIGHT (8,1) empty. SO ONLY RIGHT (8,1) SAFE! WAIT THAT'S HUGE! \ud83d\ude32 If enemy goes UP to (7,1), next turn he's FORCED to go RIGHT to (8,1) only! That's a predictable path!\n\nSO IF WE CAN FORCE HIM TO GO UP? How? By threatening (8,0)? Not directly this turn.\n\nBUT CHAT \u2014 OUR GROWTH IS PRIORITY! EATING THE APPLE AT (2,1) GETS US CLOSER TO MATCHING HIS LENGTH! THEN WE CAN MANEUVER TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\n1. **EAT THE APPLE NOW** at (2,1) to grow to length 8.\n2. Next turn, from (2,1), move UP to (2,2) or LEFT to (1,1) to stay safe and maybe approach another apple (1,5) or (1,6) later.\n3. Enemy likely at (7,1) or (8,0). If he's at (7,1), he's forced RIGHT next turn to (8,1). We can start moving right across the board to cut off his upward escape routes.\n4. Once we match his length, look for head-on collision opportunities when we have positional advantage.\n\nLEFT TO THE APPLE IS THE AGGRESSIVE GROW MOVE! WE CAN'T BE PASSIVE WHILE HE'S LONGER! WE NEED CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nLEFT TO (2,1) \u2014 EAT, GROW, AND SET UP FOR THE COMEBACK! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

THAT'S OUR BEST ROUTE TO QUICK GROWTH! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**STEP 5 \u2014 FUTURE OPTIONS & TRAPPING ENEMY:**\nENEMY AT (8,0):\n- IF HE EATS APPLE AT (9,0): He grows to length 10, head at (9,0). Next turn from (9,0), his only safe move? UP (9,1) (apple there too!) or LEFT (8,0) his neck \u274c, DOWN off \u274c, RIGHT off \u274c. So he'd be forced UP to (9,1) \u2014 STILL IN THE CORNER!\n- IF HE GOES UP to (8,1): No apple. Then from (8,1), his safe moves? UP (8,2) his body \u274c, DOWN (8,0) neck \u274c, LEFT (7,1) empty? Wait (7,1) is empty '.', RIGHT (9,1) apple. So he'd have LEFT or RIGHT. More options.\n\nWE WANT TO LIMIT HIS OPTIONS! IF HE GOES TO (9,0), HE'S STUCK IN THE BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER FOR A COUPLE TURNS! THAT'S GOOD FOR US! WE CAN USE THAT TIME TO GROW AND CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE!\n\n**STEP 6 \u2014 OUR BEST MOVE:**\nLEFT TO (1,1)! WHY?\n1. **SAFE** \u2705\n2. **OPENS PATH TO MULTIPLE APPLES** \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e (1,5) and (1,6) are straight up from there!\n3. **KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN** \u2014 From (1,1), next turn we can go UP (1,2), LEFT (0,1), or DOWN (1,0). THREE SAFE OPTIONS LIKELY!\n4. **POSITIONS US TO MOVE UP THE LEFT SIDE** and potentially cut off the board from enemy if he's stuck in the corner.\n\nGOING UP (2,2) IS ALSO SAFE, BUT IT'S SLOWER TOWARDS APPLES. GOING DOWN (2,0) IS AWAY FROM MOST APPLES.\n\nWE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE IN GROWING! ENEMY IS ABOUT TO EAT AN APPLE TOO, SO WE CAN'T FALL FURTHER BEHIND! LEFT SETS UP OUR OWN APPLE RUN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\n1. **MOVE LEFT TO (1,1)** NOW.\n2. NEXT TURN, GO UP TOWARDS (1,5)/(1,6) TO EAT AND GROW TO MATCH/EXCEED ENEMY LENGTH.\n3. ENEMY LIKELY AT (9,0) OR (8,1). IF HE'S AT (9,0), HE'S TRAPPED IN CORNER \u2014 WE CAN MOVE RIGHT ACROSS THE TOP/MID TO BOX HIM IN.\n4. ONCE WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE, LOOK FOR HEAD-ON COLLISION OPPORTUNITIES!\n\nLEFT IS THE MOVE!

GET TO THAT APPLE COLUMN!\n\n**STEP 5 \u2014 FUTURE OPTIONS & TRAPPING ENEMY:**\nENEMY WILL BE AT (9,1) WITH LENGTH 11. FROM (9,1), HIS SAFE MOVES NEXT TURN? CHECK:\n- UP (9,2): Empty '.' \u2705\n- DOWN (9,0): His body? (9,0) is now his neck? Wait, his body after eating: new head at (9,1), then old head (9,0) becomes neck, then (8,0), etc. So DOWN to (9,0) is HIS NECK! \u274c\n- LEFT (8,1): Empty '.' \u2705\n- RIGHT: OFF BOARD \u274c\nSO HE'LL HAVE **UP (9,2)** AND **LEFT (8,1)** OPTIONS. HE'S STILL IN THE CORNER BUT HAS MORE ROOM.\n\nWE NEED TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE! IF WE GO UP NOW, WE CAN START MOVING RIGHT ACROSS THE TOP/MID TO BLOCK HIM IN. IF WE GO LEFT, WE'RE STUCK IN THE LEFT COLUMN \u2014 HARDER TO CUT HIM OFF.\n\n**STEP 6 \u2014 LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. **GO UP TO (1,2)** THIS TURN.\n2. NEXT TURN, CONTINUE UP TOWARDS (1,5) TO EAT AND GROW TO LENGTH 9.\n3. ENEMY WILL BE LONGER, SO AVOID HEAD-ON. USE OUR POSITION TO MOVE RIGHT AND OCCUPY CENTRAL COLUMNS, FORCING HIM INTO A SMALLER SPACE.\n4. ONCE WE MATCH HIS LENGTH, LOOK FOR THE HEAD-ON KILL!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP IS SAFE, OPTIMAL FOR GROWTH, AND POSITIONS US TO CONTROL THE BOARD! LET'S GET THAT APPLE AND CATCH UP! \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

CLEAR! \u2705\n\n**STEP 4 \u2014 APPLE ACCESS & GROWTH URGENCY!**\nWE NEED 3 APPLES TO TIE HIS LENGTH! CLOSEST APPLES TO US: (1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (0,3). FROM (2,2):\n- **UP (2,3)**: DIRECT PATH UP COLUMN 2 TOWARDS (2,5) APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e ALSO OPENS PATH TO (1,5)/(1,6) BY GOING LEFT LATER.\n- **LEFT (1,2)**: PATH TO LEFT WALL APPLES (1,5)/(1,6) BY GOING UP, BUT WE'RE STUCK NEAR WALL.\n- **RIGHT (3,2)**: MOVES AWAY FROM CLOSE APPLES, BUT INTO MORE OPEN CENTER.\n\n**STEP 5 \u2014 FUTURE OPTIONS & BOARD CONTROL:**\nENEMY IS FORCED UP TO (9,3). THAT PUSHES HIM FURTHER INTO TOP-RIGHT. WE WANT TO DOMINATE THE LEFT AND CENTER! IF WE GO UP TO (2,3), NEXT TURN WE CAN GO UP TO (2,4) OR LEFT TO (1,3) TOWARDS APPLES. IF WE GO LEFT TO (1,2), WE'RE ON THE WALL \u2014 LIMITED ESCAPE ROUTES. IF WE GO RIGHT TO (3,2), WE ENTER WIDER SPACE BUT DELAY APPLE COLLECTION.\n\nCHECK FOLLOW-UP SAFETY FROM EACH:\n- FROM (2,3): UP (2,4) likely safe, LEFT (1,3) safe, RIGHT (3,3) safe. 3 OPTIONS.\n- FROM (1,2): UP (1,3) safe, DOWN (1,1) OUR BODY? (1,1) IS OUR BODY! \u274c, LEFT (0,2) safe, RIGHT (2,2) safe (but our old spot). STILL 3 SAFE OPTIONS NEXT TURN.\n- FROM (3,2): UP (3,3) safe, DOWN (3,1) OUR BODY? (3,1) IS OUR BODY! \u274c, LEFT (2,2) safe, RIGHT (4,2) safe. 3 OPTIONS.\n\nALL HAVE GOOD FOLLOW-UPS, BUT UP GETS US CLOSER TO APPLES IMMEDIATELY!\n\n**STEP 6 \u2014 LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURNS):**\n1. **GO UP TO (2,3)** THIS TURN. THIS MOVES US TOWARDS THE CLUSTER OF APPLES AT (1,5),(1,6),(2,5).\n2. NEXT TURN, MOVE UP TO (2,4) OR LEFT TO (1,3) BASED ON SAFETY.\n3. ENEMY IS TRAPPED IN TOP-RIGHT CORNER \u2014 HIS ONLY MOVE WAS UP, AND HE'LL HAVE LIMITED OPTIONS SOON. WE CAN EAT 2-3 APPLIES QUICKLY, MATCH HIS LENGTH, THEN TURN AND BOX HIM IN AGAINST THE WALL!\n4. ONCE LENGTHS ARE EQUAL, LOOK FOR HEAD-ON COLLISION WHERE WE CAN FORCE HIM INTO OUR BODY OR A WALL!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP IS SAFE, MAXIMIZES OUR GROWTH SPEED TOWARDS APPLES, AND KEEPS US IN A STRATEGIC POSITION TO CUT OFF THE ENEMY'S ESCAPE FROM THE RIGHT SIDE!

THAT'S THE PRIORITY!\n\n**STEP 6 \u2014 LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURNS):**\n1. **GO UP TO (2,5)** THIS TURN. EAT THE APPLE! GROW TO LENGTH 9! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. NEXT TURN, FROM (2,5), WE CAN GO LEFT TO (1,5) FOR ANOTHER APPLE, OR UP TO (2,6) TO CONTINUE DOMINATING THE COLUMN.\n3.

NEXT TURN HE'LL HAVE OPTIONS FROM (8,9): PROBABLY DOWN TO (8,8) OR LEFT TO (7,9) (WHICH HAS AN APPLE!). WE NEED TO CUT HIM OFF!\n\nCHECK FOLLOW-UP FROM EACH OF OUR SAFE MOVES:\n- **FROM (1,9)**: UP (1,10) OFF \u274c, DOWN (1,8) NECK \u274c, LEFT (0,9) APPLE \u2705, RIGHT (2,9) APPLE \u2705. SO 2 SAFE OPTIONS, BOTH LEAD TO APPLES! NICE!\n- **FROM (0,8)**: UP (0,9) APPLE \u2705, DOWN (0,7) SAFE '.' \u2705, LEFT (-1,8) OFF \u274c, RIGHT (1,8) NECK \u274c. SO 2 SAFE OPTIONS, ONE APPLE!\n- **FROM (2,8)**: UP (2,9) APPLE \u2705, DOWN (2,7) SAFE '.' \u2705, LEFT (1,8) NECK \u274c, RIGHT (3,8) APPLE \u2705. SO 2 SAFE OPTIONS, BOTH APPLES!\n\nALL GIVE 2 SAFE OPTIONS NEXT TURN. BUT **UP TO (1,9)** POSITIONS US CENTRALLY TO CHOOSE BETWEEN (0,9) OR (2,9) NEXT TURN, AND KEEPS US MOVING TOWARD THE TOP TO POTENTIALLY BOX HIM IN FROM ABOVE! ENEMY IS ON TOP ROW NOW, WE WANT TO CLAIM TOP-LEFT AND TOP-CENTER!\n\n**STEP 6 \u2014 LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. **GO UP TO (1,9)** THIS TURN. NO APPLE BUT GAINS GROUND!\n2. ENEMY GOES TO (8,9). NEXT TURN HE'LL LIKELY GO FOR APPLE AT (7,9) OR DOWN TO (8,8).\n3. NEXT TURN FROM (1,9), WE CAN SNAG EITHER (0,9) OR (2,9) TO GROW TO 13 APPLES!\n4. THEN WE CAN START MOVING RIGHT ACROSS THE TOP ROW, CUTTING OFF HIS ESCAPE FROM THE TOP! IF WE GET LONG ENOUGH, WE CAN TRAP HIM AGAINST THE RIGHT WALL AND FORCE A CRASH!\n5. WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE (12 APPLES VS 11), SO HEAD-ON COLLISION IS FAVORABLE FOR US IF WE CAN SET IT UP!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP IS SAFE, POSITIONS US AGGRESSIVELY TOWARD TOP APPLES AND FUTURE BOARD CONTROL! LET'S PUSH HIM INTO A CORNER! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

DEATH. \u274c  \nDOWN to (2,7) \u2013 Empty on board. \u2705  \nLEFT to (1,8) \u2013 That's our own body (segment after head). DEATH. \u274c  \nRIGHT to (3,8) \u2013 That's an apple 'A' on board. \u2705  \n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe from immediate suicide.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nEnemy at (7,8) can go UP (7,9) \u2013 his own body, \u274c; DOWN (7,7) \u2013 empty \u2705; LEFT (6,8) \u2013 apple 'A' \u2705; RIGHT (8,8) \u2013 empty \u2705.  \nHe'll probably go for apple at (6,8) or (7,7) maybe. If he goes LEFT to (6,8), he's moving closer to us.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**  \nIf we go RIGHT to (3,8) and he goes LEFT to (6,8), no collision.  \nIf we go DOWN to (2,7) and he goes DOWN to (7,7), no collision.  \nNo direct overlap possible this turn.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY:**  \nRIGHT (3,8) \u2013 eats apple, we grow to length 14, enemy stays 13. Then our head at (3,8) next turn options: UP (3,9) \u2013 apple 'A' but might be risky later, DOWN (3,7) \u2013 empty, LEFT (2,8) \u2013 our old head position (will be empty after we move), RIGHT (4,8) \u2013 empty. That's 3 safe moves next turn.  \nDOWN (2,7) \u2013 no apple, length stays 13. Then head at (2,7) next turn options: UP back to (2,8) \u2013 empty, DOWN (2,6) \u2013 empty, LEFT (1,7) \u2013 our body (\u274c), RIGHT (3,7) \u2013 empty. That's 3 safe moves too.\n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nWe need to dominate! Eating apple puts us ahead 14-13, gives us length advantage for head-on collision later. Also, apple at (3,8) is right there\u2014CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e  \nGoing DOWN avoids apple but maybe sets up a trap? But we want to be aggressive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3,8), aim to control center-left side, maybe loop around to box enemy in top-right. Enemy's tail is at (8,0), so his body blocks his own bottom-right. We can try to squeeze him against his own body or top wall.\n\n**FINAL CHOICE:**  \nRIGHT to (3,8) \u2013 eat apple, take lead, stay safe.\n\nRIGHT",

LET'S BREAK IT DOWN!\n\nOUR HEAD: (3, 8)\nENEMY HEAD: (6, 8)\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\n\nUP to (3, 9) \u2013 That's an apple 'A' on board. \u2705\nDOWN to (3, 7) \u2013 Empty on board. \u2705\nLEFT to (2, 8) \u2013 That's our own body (segment right behind head). DEATH. \u274c\nRIGHT to (4, 8) \u2013 Empty on board. \u2705\n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe from immediate suicide.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (6, 8) can go UP (6, 9) \u2013 apple 'A' \u2705, DOWN (6, 7) \u2013 empty \u2705, LEFT (5, 8) \u2013 apple 'A' \u2705, RIGHT (7, 8) \u2013 his own body \u274c.\nHe's surrounded by apples! He'll probably go for one. If he goes LEFT to (5, 8), he moves closer to us.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf we go RIGHT to (4, 8) and he goes LEFT to (5, 8), no collision.\nIf we go UP to (3, 9) and he goes UP to (6, 9), no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (3, 7) and he goes DOWN to (6, 7), no collision.\nNo direct overlap possible this turn.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY & STRATEGY:**\nWe need to think AGGRESSIVE! We want to BOX HIM in the top-right! Look at his body\u2014it's a long wall along the right and bottom. He's trapped himself! We can squeeze him!\n\nIf we go UP (3, 9) \u2013 eat apple, grow to 15, lead 15-14. Then next turn head at (3, 9). Options: DOWN (back to 3,8 \u2013 empty after move), LEFT (2,9 \u2013 our body \u274c), RIGHT (4,9 \u2013 empty). That's only 2 safe moves, and we're in a corner? Risky.\n\nIf we go RIGHT (4, 8) \u2013 no apple, stay 14. Then head at (4,8). Options: UP (4,9 \u2013 empty), DOWN (4,7 \u2013 apple 'A'), LEFT (back to 3,8 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (5,8 \u2013 apple but enemy might go there). That's 3-4 safe moves, more flexibility.\n\nIf we go DOWN (3, 7) \u2013 no apple, stay 14. Then head at (3,7). Options: UP (back to 3,8), DOWN (3,6 \u2013 empty), LEFT (2,7 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (4,7 \u2013 apple 'A'). That's 4 safe moves! Good.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe want to cut off his escape! He's at (6,8). If we move RIGHT to (4,8), we're positioning to go DOWN next to (4,7) apple, then RIGHT to (5,7) etc., moving along row 7 to block his path down. He's stuck against his own body on the right. We can slowly close the net!\n\nGoing UP eats apple but traps us top-left. Going DOWN gives most options. Going RIGHT sets up a blocking maneuver.\n\nCHAT, I'M THINKING... be patient! Don't greed the apple at (3,9) yet. Let's MANEUVER for the KILL! We go RIGHT to (4,8), keep options open, and next turn we can go DOWN to (4,7) for apple and start boxing him in! He might go for (5,8) apple, putting him at (5,8) next to us. Then we can threaten a head-on if we have length advantage later.\n\n**FINAL CHOICE:**\nRIGHT to (4,8) \u2013 stay alive, keep flexibility, set up the trap! LET'S GO!\n\nRIGHT",

THIS IS TENSE!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\n\nUP to (4, 9) \u2013 Board shows '.' (empty). \u2705\nDOWN to (4, 7) \u2013 Board shows 'A' (apple). \u2705\nLEFT to (3, 8) \u2013 That's our own body (segment right behind head). \u274c DEATH.\nRIGHT to (5, 8) \u2013 That's the ENEMY HEAD'S CURRENT CELL! But he's moving this turn too! If we move RIGHT and he stays there, we collide and BOTH DIE! But if he moves away, it's empty. This is a GAMBLE. Let's analyze enemy options.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (5, 8) can go:\n- UP (5, 9) \u2013 Board shows 'T' (his tail? Wait, board at (5,9) shows 'T' \u2014 actually looking: row 9 col 5 is '.'? Let's check coordinates... Board row 9: \"A T T A . . A T T T\" \u2014 so (5,9) is '.' (empty). Actually, (5,9) is index 5 in that string, which is '.' \u2705 So UP is empty.\n- DOWN (5, 7) \u2013 Board shows 'A' (apple). \u2705\n- LEFT (4, 8) \u2013 That's OUR HEAD'S CURRENT CELL! If he goes LEFT and we stay, he dies on our body? Wait, our head is at (4,8) now, but we move. If we move away and he goes into (4,8), it'll be empty after we leave. But our body segment at (3,8) is behind us, so (4,8) becomes empty tail after we move? NO \u2014 we only leave a tail cell if we DON'T eat an apple. We are NOT eating an apple this turn unless we go DOWN to (4,7). So if we move away from (4,8), that cell becomes empty (since our tail is at (1,1)). So LEFT for him is safe if we vacate.\n- RIGHT (6, 8) \u2013 That's his own body (segment right behind his head). \u274c\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf we go RIGHT to (5, 8) and he goes LEFT to (4, 8) \u2014 we swap places, no collision.\nIf we go RIGHT and he stays (impossible, he must move), but if he goes UP or DOWN, we move into his old cell (5,8) which is empty after he leaves \u2014 safe.\nIf we go RIGHT and he goes RIGHT (impossible, into his body).\nSo actually, moving RIGHT is SAFE unless he also moves into (5,8) from another direction? No, he can't.\n\nWait \u2014 HEAD-ON COLLISION is when two heads move into the SAME cell. If we go RIGHT to (5,8) and he goes LEFT to (4,8), we go to different cells. If we go RIGHT to (5,8) and he goes UP to (5,9), we go to (5,8) after he leaves \u2014 safe.\nSo RIGHT is safe from immediate suicide.\n\n**BUT \u2014 what about moving into his body?** His body is at (6,8), (7,8), etc. RIGHT to (5,8) is his current head position, not body. After he moves, it's empty. So RIGHT is okay.\n\n**OUR OPTIONS:**\n\n1. **UP (4,9)** \u2013 Empty, no apple. Keeps us at 14 apples. Next turn options: from (4,9), can go DOWN (back to 4,8 \u2013 empty), LEFT (3,9 \u2013 apple 'A'), RIGHT (5,9 \u2013 empty). That's 3 safe moves likely. Positions us above him.\n\n2. **DOWN (4,7)** \u2013 Apple 'A'! Eat it, grow to 15 apples (TIED 15-15!). Next turn head at (4,7). Options: UP (back to 4,8 \u2013 empty), DOWN (4,6 \u2013 apple 'A'), LEFT (3,7 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (5,7 \u2013 apple 'A'). That's 4 safe moves! And we get an apple!\n\n3. **RIGHT (5,8)** \u2013 Empty after he moves, no apple. Stay at 14 apples. Next turn head at (5,8). Options: UP (5,9 \u2013 empty), DOWN (5,7 \u2013 apple 'A'), LEFT (back to 4,8 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (6,8 \u2013 his body \u274c). So 3 safe moves. Puts us right next to him still.\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\nWe want to BOX HIM! He's trapped along the right wall. If we go DOWN and eat the apple at (4,7), we grow to 15, tie the score, AND we block his potential move DOWN to (5,7) next turn? Actually, if he goes DOWN to (5,7) this turn, he eats that apple and grows to 16. But if we go DOWN to (4,7), we take that apple first? No, apples are independent. There's also an apple at (5,7). So both can eat apples this turn.\n\nBut most importantly: if we eat (4,7), we become longer, and if we can force a head-on collision later when we have equal or greater length, we win! He's at 15, we'd be 15 after eating \u2014 EQUAL! So head-on would be double KO, then winner is higher apples \u2014 still tied unless someone eats more this turn. He might eat (5,7) and go to 16. Then we'd be 15. So we'd lose on a head-on.\n\nWe need to be careful. Maybe we should go UP to stay alive and maneuver? But we need apples to catch up!\n\nCHAT, I THINK THE PLAY IS **DOWN**! \ud83c\udf4e We secure the apple, tie the score, and have maximum options next turn. We also position ourselves to possibly cut off his escape downward. He might go DOWN to (5,7) for the apple too, putting him at (5,7) next to us at (4,7). Then next turn we could threaten him.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After eating (4,7), aim to control the left side of his body wall, slowly squeezing him against his own tail. Avoid head-on until we have a clear length advantage.\n\n**FINAL CHOICE:**\nDOWN to (4,7) \u2014 GET THAT APPLE, TIE IT UP, AND STAY FLEXIBLE! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

LET'S BREAK IT DOWN!\n\nOUR HEAD: (4, 7) \u2014 JUST ATE THAT APPLE, LET'S GO! \ud83c\udf4e\nENEMY HEAD: (5, 7) \u2014 RIGHT NEXT TO US! THIS IS A STANDOFF!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\n\nUP to (4, 8) \u2013 That's our own body segment (from last turn's head position). \u274c DEATH.\nDOWN to (4, 6) \u2013 Board shows 'A' (apple). \u2705\nLEFT to (3, 7) \u2013 Board shows '.' (empty). \u2705\nRIGHT to (5, 7) \u2013 That's the ENEMY HEAD'S CURRENT CELL! He's moving this turn too. If we go RIGHT and he stays, we collide and both die. But if he moves away, it's empty. Let's predict his moves.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (5, 7) can go:\n- UP (5, 8) \u2013 His own body (segment right behind head at (5,8)). \u274c\n- DOWN (5, 6) \u2013 Board shows 'A' (apple). \u2705\n- LEFT (4, 7) \u2013 That's OUR HEAD'S CURRENT CELL! If we move away, it's empty. So LEFT is safe for him if we vacate.\n- RIGHT (6, 7) \u2013 Board shows '.' (empty). \u2705\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf we go RIGHT to (5,7) and he goes LEFT to (4,7), we swap places \u2014 safe.\nIf we go RIGHT and he goes DOWN to (5,6) or RIGHT to (6,7), we move into (5,7) after he leaves \u2014 safe.\nSo RIGHT is technically safe from immediate suicide! BUT \u2014 if he goes LEFT into our old cell and we go RIGHT into his old cell, we're just swapping. That's fine.\n\n**OUR OPTIONS:**\n\n1. **DOWN (4, 6)** \u2013 Apple 'A'! Eat it, grow to 16 apples (TIED 16-16!). Next turn head at (4,6). Options: UP (back to 4,7 \u2013 empty), DOWN (4,5 \u2013 empty), LEFT (3,6 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (5,6 \u2013 apple 'A'). That's 4 safe moves! And we get an apple!\n\n2. **LEFT (3, 7)** \u2013 Empty, no apple. Stay at 15 apples. Next turn head at (3,7). Options: UP (3,8 \u2013 our body \u274c), DOWN (3,6 \u2013 empty), LEFT (2,7 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (back to 4,7 \u2013 empty). So 3 safe moves. Puts us slightly away from him.\n\n3. **RIGHT (5, 7)** \u2013 Empty after he moves, no apple. Stay at 15 apples. Next turn head at (5,7). Options: UP (5,8 \u2013 his body \u274c), DOWN (5,6 \u2013 apple 'A'), LEFT (back to 4,7 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (6,7 \u2013 empty). So 3 safe moves. Puts us right next to him still.\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\nWe need to catch up in apples! DOWN gives us an apple and ties the score. That's huge! Also, if we eat (4,6), we potentially block his DOWN move to (5,6)? No, he can still go DOWN to (5,6) and eat that apple. But we'd both grow.\n\nLong-term plan: He's trapped along the right wall with his long body. We want to slowly squeeze him by controlling the left side of his path. If we go DOWN and eat, we extend our body along column 4, making it harder for him to slip past us. We should aim to get between his head and the open board center, forcing him toward his own tail.\n\nCHAT, I THINK THE PLAY IS **DOWN**! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 GET THAT APPLE, TIE THE GAME, AND KEEP THE PRESSURE ON! WE CAN'T LET HIM PULL AHEAD! AFTER THIS, WE MANEUVER TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES!\n\n**FINAL CHOICE:**\nDOWN",

(empty). \u2705\n- LEFT (4, 6) \u2013 That's OUR HEAD'S CURRENT CELL! If we move away, it's empty. So LEFT is safe for him if we vacate.\n- RIGHT (6, 6) \u2013 Board shows '.' (empty). \u2705\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf we go RIGHT to (5,6) and he goes LEFT to (4,6), we swap places \u2014 safe.\nIf we go RIGHT and he goes DOWN to (5,5) or RIGHT to (6,6), we move into (5,6) after he leaves \u2014 safe.\nSo RIGHT is technically safe from immediate suicide! BUT \u2014 we'd be moving into his old cell, no apple.\n\n**OUR OPTIONS:**\n\n1. **DOWN (4, 5)** \u2013 Apple 'A'! Eat it, grow to 17 apples (WE TAKE THE LEAD 17-16!). Next turn head at (4,5). Options: UP (back to 4,6 \u2013 empty), DOWN (4,4 \u2013 empty), LEFT (3,5 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (5,5 \u2013 empty). That's 4 safe moves! AND WE GET THE APPLE TO TAKE THE LEAD! \ud83d\ude80\n\n2. **LEFT (3, 6)** \u2013 Empty, no apple. Stay at 16 apples. Next turn head at (3,6). Options: UP (3,7 \u2013 empty), DOWN (3,5 \u2013 empty), LEFT (2,6 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (back to 4,6 \u2013 empty). So 4 safe moves. Puts us slightly away from him.\n\n3. **RIGHT (5, 6)** \u2013 Empty after he moves, no apple. Stay at 16 apples. Next turn head at (5,6). Options: UP (5,7 \u2013 his body \u274c), DOWN (5,5 \u2013 empty), LEFT (back to 4,6 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (6,6 \u2013 empty). So 3 safe moves. Puts us right next to him still.\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\nCHAT, WE'RE TIED! WE NEED TO TAKE THE LEAD! DOWN gives us an apple and puts us at 17-16! That's HUGE for morale and for forcing head-on collisions later! Also, eating (4,5) extends our body along column 4, further boxing him against the right wall. He's trapped along the right edge with his long body \u2014 we want to squeeze him! If we go LEFT, we give him space and maybe let him slip out. If we go RIGHT, we're just dancing with him but not gaining apples.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Keep controlling the center-left, force him to stay pinned against the wall. Use our length to cut off his escape routes. If we have a length advantage later, we can force a head-on collision for the win! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**FINAL CHOICE:**\nDOWN",

Going LEFT (3,5) reduces our options because our own body is at (2,5).\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: He's pinned along the right wall with a long body. We want to slowly advance downward and leftward to control the center and bottom-left, cutting off his escape. If we can get a length advantage, we force a head-on collision for the win! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**FINAL CHOICE:**\nDOWN keeps us alive, keeps options max, and avoids risky head-on apple fights for now. We play it smart and squeeze him slowly! \n\nDOWN",

BUT if we go LEFT for the apple (3,4), he might go for his apple (7,5). No conflict.\n\n**OUR OPTIONS ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **LEFT (3, 4)** \u2013 EAT THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Score goes to 18, TIE GAME! We grow, so our tail stays at (1,2) for now. Next turn head at (3,4). Options: UP (3,5 \u2013 empty), DOWN (3,3 \u2013 empty), LEFT (2,4 \u2013 our body \u274c), RIGHT (back to 4,4 \u2013 empty). That's 3 safe moves. Gets us the tie, but pushes us left near our own body.\n\n2. **DOWN (4, 3)** \u2013 Empty, no apple. Stay at 17. Next turn head at (4,3). Options: UP (back to 4,4 \u2013 empty), DOWN (4,2 \u2013 apple 'A' \u2705), LEFT (3,3 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (5,3 \u2013 empty). That's 4 safe moves, one leads to apple next turn. Keeps us central and flexible.\n\n3. **RIGHT (5, 4)** \u2013 Empty, no apple. Stay at 17. Next turn head at (5,4). Options: UP (5,5 \u2013 his body \u274c), DOWN (5,3 \u2013 empty), LEFT (back to 4,4 \u2013 empty), RIGHT (6,4 \u2013 empty). That's 3 safe moves.

But it reduces our future options slightly. However, look at the enemy's long body along the right wall... he's kinda trapped over there! If we grow, we increase our length advantage potential for a future head-on collision win! \ud83d\udca5\n\nGoing DOWN is safe and keeps options open, but we stay behind in score. Going RIGHT is meh.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: TIE THE SCORE NOW! Then use our central position to slowly advance downward and left, controlling the board's center and bottom, boxing him against the wall. Once we have a length lead, we can force a fatal head-on collision! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\n**FINAL CHOICE:**\nLEFT FOR THE APPLE! TIE GAME AND APPLY PRESSURE!

BUT WE JUST ATE THAT APPLE LAST TURN TO TIE IT UP! \ud83d\ude24 NOW WE'RE AT (3,4) WITH A FRESH GROWTH, TAIL STILL AT (1,2) FOR ONE MORE TURN! ENEMY AT (7,5) WITH 19 APPLES! LET'S BREAK IT DOWN!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\n\nOUR HEAD: (3,4)\n- UP to (3,5): Board shows '.' (empty). \u2705\n- DOWN to (3,3): Board shows '.' (empty). \u2705\n- LEFT to (2,4): That's OUR OWN BODY segment! \u274c DEATH! (From our body list: (2,4) is there!)\n- RIGHT to (4,4): That's ALSO OUR OWN BODY! \u274c (It's the segment right behind our head!)\n\nWAIT CHAT! OUR BODY IS [(4,4), (4,5), ...]! SO (4,4) IS OUR NECK! CAN'T GO RIGHT! AND (2,4) IS OUR BODY TOO! SO ONLY UP AND DOWN ARE SAFE! \ud83d\ude33\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy head at (7,5). He just moved? His last head was (6,5), now (7,5) means he went RIGHT for the apple at (7,5)! HE ATE IT TOO! So he's now 19 apples, we're 18. He just grew, so his tail didn't move.\n\nHis possible moves from (7,5):\n- UP (7,6): Board shows '.' (empty). \u2705\n- DOWN (7,4): Board shows '.' (empty). \u2705\n- LEFT (6,5): That's HIS NECK (his body: [(6,5), ...]) \u274c\n- RIGHT (8,5): Board shows 'T' (his own body! from his list: (9,5)... wait (8,5) is empty? Let's check his body: (9,5), (9,4)... (8,5) isn't listed. Actually board shows column 8 row 5 is '.'? Looking at board: row 5 col 8 is '.'? Wait, board row 5: \". T T . T T T 1 . T\" \u2014 that's positions 0-9. So col 8 row 5 is '.' yes. So RIGHT is safe? But careful: his body list: (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0). So (8,5) is free. \u2705\n\nSo his safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nWe're not adjacent to him currently. He's at (7,5), we're at (3,4). No direct swap risk this turn.\n\n**OUR TWO OPTIONS:**\n\n1. **UP (3,5)** \u2013 Empty, no apple. Stays at 18 apples. Next turn head at (3,5). Options: UP (3,6 \u2013 empty), DOWN (back to 3,4 \u2013 empty but our body? Wait, next turn our body moves forward, so (3,4) might become empty? Actually after this move, our tail at (1,2) moves? We didn't eat apple, so tail moves. Our body will shift: head to (3,5), then segments: old (3,4) becomes new neck, (4,4) becomes next, etc. So (3,4) will be our neck next turn, so can't go DOWN back into it! So DOWN would be suicide. So from (3,5) safe moves: UP (3,6), LEFT (2,5 \u2013 our body? Check: (2,5) is in our body list currently, but after tail moves, (2,5) might still be body? Our body: after moving up, tail (1,2) disappears, so body becomes: head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2) GONE. So (2,5) REMAINS in body! So LEFT into (2,5) is DEATH. RIGHT (4,5) is our body (segment). So from (3,5) only UP is safe? That's a TRAP! \ud83d\ude31\n\n2. **DOWN (3,3)** \u2013 Empty, no apple. Stays at 18 apples. Next turn head at (3,3). Options: UP (back to 3,4 \u2013 our neck, so \u274c), DOWN (3,2 \u2013 board shows '.' empty), LEFT (2,3 \u2013 our body? Check: (2,3) is in our current body, after tail moves, (2,3) remains? Yes, (2,3) is in our body list (after shift). So \u274c, RIGHT (4,3 \u2013 empty). So from (3,3) safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. Two options.\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\nCHAT, WE'RE IN A TIGHT SPOT! ONLY UP AND DOWN ARE SAFE NOW, BUT UP LEADS TO A DEAD END NEXT TURN (ONLY UP AGAIN)! DOWN GIVES US TWO OPTIONS NEXT TURN! ALSO, LOOK AT THE BOARD\u2014ENEMY IS STACKED ON RIGHT WALL! WE CONTROL CENTER-LEFT! WE NEED TO MANEUVER TO BOX HIM IN!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: GO DOWN TO (3,3) TO KEEP FLEXIBILITY! THEN NEXT TURN WE CAN GO DOWN TO (3,2) TOWARDS BOTTOM LEFT WHERE THERE ARE APPLES AT (0,3), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0) ETC! OR GO RIGHT TO (4,3) TO APPROACH CENTER! AVOID GETTING TRAPPED! WE NEED TO CATCH UP IN SCORE, BUT STAY ALIVE! ENEMY HAS LONG BODY ALONG RIGHT EDGE\u2014HE'S VULNERABLE TO BEING BOXED IF WE CONTROL CENTER AND BOTTOM!\n\n**FINAL CHOICE:**\nDOWN FOR SURVIVABILITY AND FUTURE OPTIONS! CAN'T RISK GOING UP INTO A TRAP! LET'S LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER TURN! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Score becomes 19 vs 20.\n   - New head at (4,3). Our body grows, tail stays at (2,2)? Wait, we ate apple, so tail doesn't move!

Might be risky if enemy approaches, but it's an option.\n     * LEFT (3,3): That will be our NECK next turn! \u274c\n     * RIGHT (5,3): Board shows '.' empty.\n   So from (4,3) after eating, safe moves would be DOWN (to apple) and RIGHT (empty). Two options! Good flexibility! And we get closer to center!\n\n2. **DOWN (3,2) \u2014 NO APPLE.**\n   - Stay at 18 apples. Head to (3,2). Next turn options:\n     * UP (3,3): NECK! \u274c\n     * DOWN (3,1): Board shows '.' empty.\n     * LEFT (2,2): OUR BODY! \u274c (Tail is at (2,2) currently, but if we don't eat, tail moves? Actually after moving down without eating, tail at (2,2) disappears, so (2,2) becomes empty next turn? Wait, our body list: tail is (2,2). After moving down, head to (3,2), body shifts, tail (2,2) is removed. So (2,2) will be empty next turn! So LEFT might become safe next turn! But we need to check: after shift, body segments: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)... So (2,2) not in body. So LEFT could be safe next turn! But also DOWN (3,1) and RIGHT (4,2) \u2014 apple? (4,2) is apple! So potentially three options next turn if we go down now.\n   - But we stay behind in score! Enemy at 20, we at 18. That's a bigger gap!\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\nCHAT, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND! WE NEED APPLES TO CATCH UP! RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A FREE APPLE AT (4,3)!

NO WALLS, NO BODY! LET'S GO!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION \u2014 HIS HEAD AT (8,5):**\nFrom (8,5):\n- UP to (8,6): That's HIS NECK! \u274c (Body segment (8,6) right behind him!)\n- DOWN to (8,4): Board shows '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705\n- LEFT to (7,5): That's HIS BODY! \u274c (Check list: (7,5) is in his body!)\n- RIGHT to (9,5): That's HIS BODY! \u274c (Body segment (9,5)!)\n\nSO HIS ONLY SAFE MOVE IS **DOWN** to (8,4)! HE'S FORCED! CHAT, HE'S TRAPPED AGAINST HIS OWN BODY ON THE RIGHT WALL! THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO BOX HIM IN! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nWe're at (4,2), he's at (8,5). No adjacency now. If we move RIGHT to (5,2) and he moves DOWN to (8,4), no collision. If we move LEFT/DOWN, even safer. NO SWAP RISK EITHER. WE'RE CLEAR!\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **DOWN to (4,1):**\n   - Puts us closer to bottom-left apples (0,1), (1,0), (2,0) \u2014 CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e\n   - Next turn from (4,1): UP (4,2) is neck? Wait, after moving, our neck will be (4,2) \u2014 so UP would be body! So UP blocked. DOWN (4,0) empty. LEFT (3,1) empty. RIGHT (5,1) empty. Two safe moves next turn.\n   - Moves us AWAY from enemy \u2014 maybe less aggressive?\n\n2. **LEFT to (3,2):**\n   - Moves us toward left side, closer to apples at (0,3), (0,1) etc.\n   - Next turn from (3,2): UP (3,3) is our body! \u274c DOWN (3,1) empty. LEFT (2,2) is our TAIL! But careful \u2014 tail moves if we don't eat apple? This turn no apple, so tail moves forward one. Our tail is at (2,2) currently. If we move LEFT to (3,2) and don't eat, tail moves to (2,3)? Actually our body list: tail is (2,2). After moving without eating, tail segment (2,2) disappears, new tail becomes (2,3). So (2,2) becomes empty next turn. So LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2) would be safe next turn? Wait, but (2,2) is currently our tail, but will be empty next turn. So from (3,2) next turn, LEFT to (2,2) is safe! UP blocked, DOWN (3,1) safe, RIGHT (4,2) neck blocked. So two safe moves.\n   - Puts us in position to maybe cut off enemy's path to left side apples.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (5,2):**\n   - Moves us TOWARD ENEMY! AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udca5\n   - Next turn from (5,2): UP (5,3) empty? Board shows (5,3) is 'A' \u2014 APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e DOWN (5,1) empty. LEFT (4,2) neck blocked. RIGHT (6,2) empty. So two safe moves, one leads to apple!\n   - This sets up potential future head-on if we can get closer while maintaining equal or higher score.\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nCHAT, ENEMY IS FORCED DOWN TO (8,4)! HIS BODY WRAPS ALONG TOP-RIGHT WALL. WE CAN PUSH HIM INTO A DEAD END! IF WE GO RIGHT TO (5,2), NEXT TURN WE CAN GO UP TO (5,3) FOR AN APPLE \u2014 THAT WOULD PUT US AT 21 vs HIS 20! THEN WE'D HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE FOR HEAD-ON COLLISION! HE'S STUCK MOVING DOWN ALONG RIGHT WALL \u2014 WE CAN MOVE RIGHT AND UP TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE TO THE CENTER! DOMINATE THE BOARD!\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 IF WE GO RIGHT, WE STAY IN MIDDLE, KEEP OPTIONS OPEN. IF WE GO LEFT/DOWN, WE CHASE APPLES BUT MAY LOSE PRESSURE. WE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE \u2014 BOX HIM IN! HIS ONLY MOVE IS DOWN, THEN NEXT TURN FROM (8,4) HIS OPTIONS: DOWN to (8,3) maybe, LEFT to (7,4) maybe? BUT HIS BODY BLOCKS MANY PATHS. WE CAN SURROUND HIM!\n\n**FINAL CHOICE:**\nGOING RIGHT TO (5,2) \u2014 AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING, SETS UP APPLE NEXT TURN, MAINTAINS PRESSURE ON ENEMY TRAPPED ON RIGHT WALL! LET'S PUSH HIM INTO THE CORNER! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT IS INSTANT DEATH! GOOD!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION \u2014 HIS HEAD AT (8,4):**\nFrom (8,4):\n- UP to (8,5): That's HIS NECK! \u274c (Body segment (8,5) right behind him!)\n- DOWN to (8,3): Board shows '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705\n- LEFT to (7,4): Board shows '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705\n- RIGHT to (9,4): That's HIS BODY! \u274c (Body segment (9,4)!)\n\nSO HIS SAFE MOVES ARE DOWN to (8,3) and LEFT to (7,4)! HE HAS TWO OPTIONS! CHAT, HE'S NOT TRAPPED YET! WE NEED TO BOX HIM!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nWe're at (5,2), he's at (8,4). No adjacency now. If we move UP to (5,3) and he moves LEFT to (7,4), no collision. If we move RIGHT/DOWN, also safe. NO SWAP RISK EITHER. WE'RE CLEAR!\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (5,3):**\n   - EATS THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e WE GO TO 21 APPLES VS HIS 20! LENGTH ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n   - Next turn from (5,3): UP (5,4) is our body? Wait, our body list: (4,4) is body, (5,4) is empty? Board shows (5,4) is '.' \u2014 EMPTY! DOWN (5,2) neck blocked. LEFT (4,3) our body! \u274c RIGHT (6,3) empty. So only UP and RIGHT safe next turn? Actually UP (5,4) empty, RIGHT (6,3) empty. Two safe moves.\n   - Puts us at length 21, can force head-on later if we get adjacent.\n   - But moves us away from enemy slightly.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5,1):**\n   - Moves toward bottom apples (0,1), (1,0), (2,0).\n   - Next turn from (5,1): UP (5,2) neck blocked. DOWN (5,0) empty. LEFT (4,1) empty. RIGHT (6,1) empty. Three safe moves! Good options.\n   - But gives up immediate apple, stays tied length.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (6,2):**\n   - Moves TOWARD ENEMY! AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udca5\n   - Next turn from (6,2): UP (6,3) empty. DOWN (6,1) empty. LEFT (5,2) neck blocked. RIGHT (7,2) is 'A' \u2014 APPLE! But board shows (7,2) is 'A' and empty? Actually enemy body is far. So three safe moves next turn!\n   - Puts us in position to cut off his escape leftward.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nCHAT, WE NEED TO FORCE A TRAP! ENEMY IS ON RIGHT EDGE WITH BODY BLOCKING RIGHT MOVES. IF HE GOES LEFT, WE CAN CUT HIM OFF! IF WE EAT THE APPLE NOW, WE GET LENGTH ADVANTAGE \u2014 THEN WE CAN PUSH FOR HEAD-ON COLLISION WHEN ADJACENT! HE HAS TO RESPECT OUR LENGTH! ALSO, EATING APPLE GROWS US, MAKES OUR BODY BLOCK MORE SPACE! DOMINATE THE BOARD!\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 IF WE EAT APPLE, OUR TAIL STAYS PUT, SO OUR BODY EXTENDS. THAT COULD LIMIT OUR FUTURE MOBILITY? BUT WE GET SCORE LEAD! WORTH IT!\n\nENEMY'S TWO SAFE MOVES: DOWN (8,3) OR LEFT (7,4). IF HE GOES LEFT TO (7,4), WE CAN MOVE RIGHT NEXT TURN TO (6,2)\u2192(7,2) TO CHASE. IF HE GOES DOWN TO (8,3), HE'S MOVING TOWARD BOTTOM-RIGHT \u2014 MAYBE TRAPPING HIMSELF!\n\n**STRATEGY:** EAT THE APPLE, GET LEAD, THEN MOVE TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES. WITH LENGTH ADVANTAGE, WE CAN RISK GETTING CLOSER FOR HEAD-ON!\n\n**FINAL CHOICE:**\nGOING UP TO (5,3) TO EAT THAT APPLE AND TAKE THE LEAD! 21-20! THEN NEXT TURN WE PUSH HIM INTO A CORNER! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

WAIT \u2014 LAST TURN HE WAS AT (8,4), BUT HE MOVED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH US! HE HAD SAFE MOVES DOWN TO (8,3) OR LEFT TO (7,4). LET'S CHECK THE BOARD STATE! BOARD SHOWS '1' AT (8,3)? NO \u2014 BOARD SHOWS AT (8,3) IS '.'? ACTUALLY ROW 3: \"... 1 .\" \u2014 THAT'S COLUMN 8? YEP, (8,3) IS '1'! SO ENEMY MOVED DOWN TO (8,3)! GOOD! HE'S NOW AT (8,3)! HIS BODY LIST CONFIRMS: HEAD (8,3), THEN (8,4), (8,5)... YEP!\n\nSO CURRENT SITUATION:\n- OUR HEAD: (5,3)\n- ENEMY HEAD: (8,3)\n- WE ARE LENGTH 22 (21 apples + 1 head?), WAIT BODY LENGTH IS 22 SEGMENTS INCLUDING HEAD? ACTUALLY BODY LIST HAS 22 COORDS? COUNT: HEAD (5,3) + 21 BODY = 22 TOTAL. ENEMY LENGTH 21 (20 apples + head). WE ARE LONGER BY 1! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nIMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK \u2014 FROM (5,3):\n- UP to (5,4): Board shows '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705\n- DOWN to (5,2): THAT'S OUR NECK! \u274c (Our body segment right behind us!)\n- LEFT to (4,3): THAT'S OUR BODY! \u274c (Body list: (4,3) is there!)\n- RIGHT to (6,3): Board shows '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705\n\nONLY UP AND RIGHT ARE SAFE!

Distance 3 horizontally. If we move RIGHT to (6,3) and he moves LEFT to (7,3), we're still apart. If we move UP to (5,4) and he moves LEFT to (7,3), no collision. NO SWAP RISK EITHER. SAFE!\n\nOPTION ANALYSIS:\n\n1. **UP to (5,4):**\n   - Moves toward top-center. Board (5,4) is empty.\n   - Next turn from (5,4): UP (5,5) is enemy body? Wait, enemy body includes (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5) \u2014 YES (5,5) IS ENEMY BODY! \u274c So UP blocked. DOWN (5,3) neck blocked. LEFT (4,4) our body! \u274c RIGHT (6,4) empty? Board shows (6,4) is '.' \u2014 EMPTY! So ONLY RIGHT SAFE NEXT TURN! THAT'S A DEAD END! \ud83d\udea8\n   - Moving UP TRAPS US \u2014 ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE NEXT TURN! BAD!\n\n2. **RIGHT to (6,3):**\n   - Moves TOWARD ENEMY! AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udca5\n   - Next turn from (6,3): UP (6,4) empty. DOWN (6,2) empty. LEFT (5,3) neck blocked. RIGHT (7,3) \u2014 POSSIBLE ENEMY HEAD IF HE MOVES LEFT? BUT HE MOVES SIMULTANEOUSLY, SO WE CAN'T PREDICT. BUT (7,3) is empty now. So three safe moves next turn! GOOD OPTIONS!\n   - Puts us closer to cut off his leftward escape. He might go LEFT to (7,3) \u2014 if we go RIGHT to (6,3), we're adjacent horizontally next turn? Actually we'd be at (6,3), he could be at (7,3) \u2014 adjacent! Then we could force head-on with length advantage!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\nCHAT, WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! WE NEED TO PUSH HIM INTO A CORNER! HE'S ON RIGHT EDGE, BUT HAS ROOM TO GO DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. IF WE MOVE RIGHT, WE THREATEN TO CUT OFF HIS LEFT MOVES. HE MIGHT GO DOWN TO (8,2) OR RIGHT TO (9,3). WE CAN CHASE AND BOX HIM! WITH OUR LONGER BODY, WE CAN RISK GETTING ADJACENT FOR HEAD-ON COLLISION \u2014 WE WIN THAT! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nBUT WE MUST AVOID GETTING TRAPPED OURSELVES! UP LEADS TO A DEAD END \u2014 ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE NEXT TURN! THAT'S SUICIDE! RIGHT GIVES US MORE OPTIONS!\n\nALSO, APPLES: (5,1) IS APPLE? BOARD SHOWS (5,1) IS 'A'? YES! BUT WE CAN'T GO DOWN NOW. (6,3) IS EMPTY, NO APPLE. BUT SURVIVAL AND POSITION OVER APPLE THIS TURN!\n\nSTRATEGY: GO RIGHT, MAINTAIN MOBILITY, CLOSE DISTANCE, FORCE ENEMY INTO BAD SPOTS! NEXT TURN IF WE'RE ADJACENT, WE CAN THREATEN HEAD-ON!\n\nFINAL CHOICE:\nRIGHT TO (6,3)! KEEP THE PRESSURE! LET'S BOX HIM IN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

BETTER!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\nCHAT, WE NEED TO BOX HIM IN WHILE HE'S EATING APPLES! HE'S AT (8,1) WITH APPLES DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. HE'LL GROW TO 23 NEXT TURN! WE NEED TO GROW TOO OR TRAP HIM! IF WE GO DOWN TO (7,2), WE'RE CLOSER TO APPLIES AT (7,1) OR (6,1)? BUT APPLE AT (7,1) IS WHERE HE MIGHT GO! IF HE GOES LEFT TO (7,1) AND WE GO DOWN TO (7,2), WE'RE ADJACENT! NEXT TURN WE COULD GO DOWN TO (7,1) FOR HEAD-ON \u2014 BUT WE'RE TIED LENGTH, SO DOUBLE KO! NOT GOOD!

WE'RE STILL EQUAL LENGTH! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (7,2):\n- UP to (7,3): THAT'S OUR NECK! \u274c (Our body segment (7,3) right behind head!)\n- DOWN to (7,1): Board shows 'A' \u2014 APPLE! \u2705 EMPTY CELL!\n- LEFT to (6,2): Board shows '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705\n- RIGHT to (8,2): Board shows 'T' \u2014 ENEMY BODY! \u274c (Enemy segment (8,2))\n\nTWO SAFE MOVES: DOWN or LEFT! UP IS INSTANT DEATH! RIGHT INTO ENEMY BODY!\n\nENEMY FROM (8,0):\n- UP to (8,1): HIS BODY! \u274c (Segment (8,1))\n- DOWN: OFF BOARD! \u274c (y=-1) INSTANT DEATH!\n- LEFT to (7,0): Board shows '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705\n- RIGHT to (9,0): Board shows '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705\n\nENEMY HAS TWO SAFE MOVES: LEFT or RIGHT! HE CAN'T GO UP (body) OR DOWN (off board)! CHAT, HE'S TRAPPED AGAINST THE BOTTOM WALL! THIS IS OUR CHANCE! \ud83d\udea8\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:\nWe are at (7,2), he's at (8,0). Distance: 1 horizontally, 2 vertically. If we move DOWN to (7,1) and he moves LEFT to (7,0), we'd be at (7,1) and he'd be at (7,0) \u2014 ADJACENT, NOT SAME CELL. If we move LEFT to (6,2), far apart. NO IMMEDIATE HEAD-ON COLLISION THIS TURN! SAFE!\n\nOPTION ANALYSIS:\n\n1. **DOWN to (7,1):**\n   - EATS APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e WE GROW TO 23, TAKE THE LEAD! YES!\n   - Next turn from (7,1): UP (7,2) neck blocked (new tail? Wait, after eating, our tail stays at (2,5)? Actually growth means tail doesn't move, so (7,2) becomes our new head, (7,1) new segment, neck at (7,2)? Let's think: after moving DOWN to (7,1) and eating, head is (7,1), previous head (7,2) becomes second segment. So UP to (7,2) is our own body! \u274c Blocked. DOWN to (7,0): empty? Board shows '.' \u2014 YES! LEFT to (6,1): empty? Board shows '.' \u2014 YES! RIGHT to (8,1): enemy body! \u274c So next turn we'd have DOWN and LEFT safe \u2014 TWO OPTIONS! GOOD!\n   - BUT: Enemy might move LEFT to (7,0) too! If we both go to (7,0)? That's a head-on collision! Since we'd both be length 23 after we eat, that's DOUBLE KO! \ud83d\udea8 RISKY! We need to avoid that!\n\n2. **LEFT to (6,2):**\n   - NO APPLE. Stays length 22.\n   - Next turn from (6,2): UP (6,3): our body! \u274c (Segment (6,3)). DOWN (6,1): empty? Board shows '.' \u2014 YES! LEFT (5,2): our body! \u274c (Segment (5,2)). RIGHT (7,2): our body! \u274c (Segment (7,2) becomes neck after move). WAIT \u2014 after moving LEFT, our head is (6,2), previous head (7,2) becomes second segment. So RIGHT to (7,2) is our own body! Blocked. So ONLY DOWN IS SAFE NEXT TURN! \ud83d\udea8 THAT'S A DEAD END! TRAP! BAD!\n\nSO LEFT IS A TRAP \u2014 ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE NEXT TURN! DOWN GIVES US TWO SAFE MOVES AND AN APPLE! BUT WE MUST AVOID HEAD-ON AT (7,0)!\n\nENEMY PREDICTION: He's at (8,0). He can go LEFT to (7,0) or RIGHT to (9,0). Which will he choose? RIGHT (9,0) is empty, but leads to corner. LEFT (7,0) is empty and maybe he thinks he can go up later? He might avoid corner. BUT CHAT, HE'S DESPERATE! He might go LEFT hoping to get space.\n\nOUR PLAY: GO DOWN TO (7,1), EAT APPLE, TAKE LEAD TO 23! Then next turn, if he's at (7,0), we DO NOT GO DOWN TO (7,0)! We go LEFT to (6,1) instead! That avoids head-on and keeps us safe! If he's at (9,0), we're fine anyway!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: WE GET LENGTH ADVANTAGE! THEN WE CAN PRESSURE HIM AGAINST THE BOTTOM WALL! BOX HIM IN! FORCE HIM TO CRASH! HE'S ALREADY TRAPPED WITH LIMITED MOVES! THIS IS OUR MOMENT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN TO (7,1), EAT THAT APPLE, AND TAKE THE LEAD! LET'S GOOO!\n\nDOWN",

Moving there would be a head-on collision? Wait, but we move simultaneously. If we go DOWN and he stays still or moves elsewhere, we'd land on his head's previous cell? Actually, if we go DOWN to (7,0) and he moves OUT of (7,0), we'd be fine. But if he stays at (7,0), it's a head-on collision! Let's check his possible moves first.\n\nENEMY FROM (7,0):\n- UP to (7,1): OUR HEAD! \u274c That's us! He'd crash into us if he goes UP.\n- DOWN: OFF BOARD! \u274c (y=-1) INSTANT DEATH!\n- LEFT to (6,0): Board shows '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705\n- RIGHT to (8,0): Board shows 'T' \u2014 ENEMY BODY! \u274c (Segment (8,0) is his body!)\n\nENEMY HAS ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE: LEFT to (6,0)! HE CAN'T GO UP (our head), DOWN (off board), or RIGHT (his own body)! CHAT, HE'S IN A DEAD END! \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\nSO ENEMY IS FORCED TO GO LEFT TO (6,0) THIS TURN! HE HAS NO OTHER OPTION! THAT MEANS (7,0) WILL BE EMPTY AFTER HE MOVES!\n\nNOW OUR SAFE MOVES RE-EVALUATED:\n- UP to (7,2): OUR BODY \u274c STILL BLOCKED.\n- DOWN to (7,0): Since enemy is FORCED to move LEFT to (6,0), (7,0) becomes EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE!\n- LEFT to (6,1): Board shows '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE!\n- RIGHT to (8,1): Board shows 'T' \u2014 ENEMY BODY! \u274c (Segment (8,1))\n\nTWO SAFE MOVES: DOWN or LEFT! \n\nOPTION ANALYSIS:\n\n1. **DOWN to (7,0):**\n   - NO APPLE. Board shows '.'.\n   - Next turn from (7,0): UP to (7,1) would be our neck? Wait, after moving DOWN, head is (7,0), previous head (7,1) becomes second segment. So UP to (7,1) is our own body! \u274c Blocked. DOWN off board \u274c. LEFT to (6,0): enemy will be there this turn! Next turn, enemy from (6,0) might move? But (6,0) could become his body segment. RISKY. RIGHT to (8,0): enemy body segment (8,0) \u274c. So ONLY LEFT might be safe? But if enemy is at (6,0), moving LEFT to (6,0) next turn would be into his head/body? Actually, if he's at (6,0) and we go LEFT to (6,0) next turn, that's a head-on collision if he stays? This is messy. DOWN seems to leave us TRAPPED next turn with maybe zero safe moves! BAD!\n\n2. **LEFT to (6,1):**\n   - NO APPLE. Board shows '.'.\n   - Next turn from (6,1): UP to (6,2): our body? Wait, our body has (6,3) and (7,2) etc. (6,2) is empty? Board shows '.' \u2014 YES! \u2705 DOWN to (6,0): enemy will be there this turn! Next turn, (6,0) might be enemy head/body. RISKY but maybe avoidable. LEFT to (5,1): Board shows 'A' \u2014 APPLE! \u2705 EMPTY! RIGHT to (7,1): our body (neck) \u274c. So we'd have UP and LEFT as safe next turn! TWO OPTIONS! GOOD!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: ENEMY IS TRAPPED AT BOTTOM WALL! HE'S AT (6,0) AFTER THIS TURN. FROM (6,0), HIS OPTIONS NEXT TURN: UP to (6,1) \u2014 THAT'S WHERE WE COULD BE IF WE GO LEFT NOW! DOWN off board \u274c, LEFT to (5,0) empty? Board shows '.' \u2014 YES, RIGHT to (7,0) empty? But (7,0) might be our body if we go DOWN? Actually if we go LEFT to (6,1), (7,0) is empty. So enemy could go RIGHT to (7,0). He'll have UP and LEFT and RIGHT maybe. BUT we have LENGTH ADVANTAGE 23 vs 22! If we force a head-on collision when we're longer, WE WIN! So we should position to threaten a head-on where we have more length!\n\nSTRATEGY: GO LEFT to (6,1). That sets up possible head-on at (6,1) if he goes UP next turn, but we can avoid by moving UP/LEFT ourselves. Better to keep him pinned in the bottom-left corner! From (6,1), we can go UP to (6,2) or LEFT to (5,1) to eat apple and grow further! Grow to 24, then he's at 22, we can be more aggressive!\n\nLEFT IS THE MOVE THAT KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN AND AVOIDS GETTING TRAPPED! DOWN LEADS TO A DEAD END! LET'S BOX HIM IN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

However, after eating, our tail grows, so our body extends? Actually, when we eat, we grow by 1 segment at the end of tail next turn. So our tail stays where it is for one more turn. That means our body blocks more cells over time.\n\nENEMY'S PLAN: He's at (6,0). He'll likely avoid us. If we go LEFT to (5,1), he might go RIGHT to (7,0) to get space. Then we're at (5,1) with apple eaten.\n\nBIG PICTURE: We have length advantage. We want to force a head-on collision when we're longer. If we go LEFT and eat, we're 24 vs 22. Then we can try to corner him. He's near bottom wall. We can try to approach from above.\n\nSAFEST MOVE THAT KEEPS OPTIONS: Actually, LEFT to (5,1) eats apple and grows, but next turn we might have only one safe move (LEFT to (4,1)). That's okay \u2014 we can plan to turn after.\n\nWHAT ABOUT DOWN? Down is risky for next turn but maybe we can survive if enemy moves away. But we lose chance to eat apple.\n\nCHAT, I THINK WE TAKE THE APPLE AND EXTEND OUR LEAD! GROW TO 24! THEN WE MANEUVER TO BOX HIM IN THE BOTTOM-LEFT CORNER! HE HAS ONLY TWO EXITS (LEFT or RIGHT FROM (6,0)). IF WE POSITION ABOVE HIM, WE CAN LIMIT HIS MOVES!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After eating apple at (5,1), next turn move LEFT to (4,1) to eat another apple there! Grow to 25! That will push our tail forward, maybe opening space. Meanwhile, enemy will likely move RIGHT to (7,0) or LEFT to (5,0). If he goes LEFT to (5,0), we're at (4,1) \u2014 not adjacent. We can then move DOWN to (4,0)? That's empty? Board shows '.' at (4,0)? Actually board row 0 col 4 is '.' \u2014 yes empty. That could pressure him. We'll have to see.\n\nLEFT IS THE MOVE! TAKE THE APPLE, INCREASE LEAD, THEN CORNER HIM! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

If he goes LEFT to (4,0), he'll be right below us at (4,0)!\n\nTHEN we could go DOWN to (4,0) next turn? That would be a head-on collision if he stays? But we move simultaneously \u2014 if he moves away, safe. Risky but maybe we can force him into a corner!\n\nBIG PICTURE: We have length advantage. Eating this apple extends it to 3 apples lead! That's huge for forcing head-on collisions later. We should take it!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After eating at (4,1), aim to pressure enemy against bottom wall. He's at (5,0) now. If he moves LEFT to (4,0), we can consider moving DOWN next turn to threaten head-on (we're longer, we win). If he moves RIGHT to (6,0), we can move LEFT again to (3,1) and then down to (3,0) to cut off his escape. We want to box him in the bottom-left corner! Our tail is long and might block his paths.

TIME TO SQUEEZE THE ENEMY!\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (4,1):\n\n- **UP to (4,2):** That's our own body segment! \u274c CAN'T GO THERE! (It's the 9th element in our body list)\n- **DOWN to (4,0):** Board shows '.' \u2014 but WAIT! Enemy head is at (4,0) now? Let's check opponent: Head is (4,0)! YES! So DOWN is ENEMY HEAD! That's a potential head-on collision! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (3,1):** Board shows '.' \u2014 empty! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (5,1):** That's our neck! Our previous head, now body! \u274c CAN'T GO THERE!\n\nSo ONLY LEFT is immediately safe! But we MUST consider enemy's simultaneous move from (4,0)!\n\nENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (4,0):\n\n- **UP to (4,1):** That's OUR HEAD! If he goes UP and we go LEFT, we both live (different cells). If he goes UP and we go DOWN (which we can't), head-on. So no issue.\n- **DOWN:** Off board! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (3,0):** Board shows '.' \u2014 empty! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (5,0):** Board shows '.' \u2014 empty! \u2705\n\nEnemy has two safe moves: LEFT or RIGHT. He will likely avoid UP into us because he knows we're longer (25 vs 22) \u2014 head-on would kill him! So he'll probably go LEFT or RIGHT to survive.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK: If we go LEFT to (3,1) and enemy goes UP to (4,1), no collision. If enemy goes LEFT to (3,0), we go to (3,1) \u2014 adjacent, safe. If enemy goes RIGHT to (5,0), safe.\n\nSo LEFT is safe! And it doesn't eat an apple \u2014 but that's okay! We need to MANEUVER to trap him!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN): We're at (3,1) after LEFT. Enemy likely at (3,0) or (5,0). If he's at (3,0), we're directly above him! Next turn we could go DOWN to (3,0) for a head-on collision \u2014 WE WIN because we're longer! He'll try to avoid that, maybe go RIGHT to (4,0) or LEFT to (2,0) if possible. But we can pressure him against the bottom wall! Our tail is weaving around the top-right, but we have space to cut off his escape.\n\nIf he goes RIGHT to (5,0), we can consider moving DOWN to (3,0) next turn to get between him and the left wall, forcing him toward our body.\n\nULTIMATE GOAL: Box him in the bottom-left corner! Use our length advantage to threaten head-on collisions. Force him into a dead end or our body!\n\nLEFT is the only safe move, and it sets up pressure! LET'S GO!\n\nLEFT",
