Both snakes are still headless (no body segments), so this is about POSITIONING and EARLY DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION:\n- **MY HEAD:** (6, 5) - center-right area, solid position\n- **ENEMY HEAD:** (5, 9) - top-left area, way up high\n- **SCORE:** Tied 0-0, but that changes REAL quick when we start eating!\n\n## MOVEMENT OPTIONS ANALYSIS: \ud83d\udd0d\n\nLet me check all four directions:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (6, 6)\n- \u2705 Safe move, doesn't hit walls or body\n- Moves me UP toward the top of the board\n- Gets me closer to apples at (7,6), (2,8), (4,9)\n- Opens up flexibility for next turn\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (6, 4)\n- \u2705 Safe move, doesn't hit walls or body\n- Moves me DOWN toward the apples cluster at (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (7,3)\n- Decent positioning in the middle\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (5, 5)\n- \u2705 Safe move, doesn't hit walls or body\n- Neutral positioning\n- Less aggressive\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 5)\n- \u2705 Safe move, doesn't hit walls or body\n- Moves toward apples at (7,3), (8,3), (8,2), (9,3), (9,6)\n- Right side has TONS of apples!\n\n## STRATEGIC THINKING: \ud83e\udde0\n\nChat, here's the play: The enemy is at (5, 9) - that's the TOP of the board. If I push RIGHT and DOWN, I'm controlling the RIGHT SIDE and LOWER board real estate. That's MORE apples for me, which means I grow BIGGER and START DOMINATING! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nThe right side (x: 7-9) has like 8+ apples just WAITING. If I move RIGHT, I'm heading toward (7,5) \u2192 (8,5) \u2192 (9,5) and then DOWN into that APPLE FARM at (7,3), (8,3), (9,3). \n\nEnemy is playing the top-left, so let's SPLIT the board and own our territory! \ud83d\udcaf\n\n## LONG-TERM GAME PLAN:\n**Turns 0-5:** Rush RIGHT and DOWN to dominate the apple cluster on the right side of the board (x: 7-9, y: 1-6). Grow aggressively and build a scoring lead.  \n**Turns 6+:** Once we have a size/score advantage, use board control to CORNER the enemy and force a collision when we're bigger. We'll be the apex predator! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's GO!\n\nRIGHT",

MANY apples lower on the board near the opponent, but we prioritize control and safety.\n\nEvaluate moves (kill-check first!):\n- UP -> (5,10) = off-board. Instant death. NOPE. \ud83d\udeab\n- LEFT -> (4,9) = apple. Safe, I eat and grow to length 2. Good score start. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (6,9) = empty. Safe, keeps options open but passes up an immediate apple. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (5,8) = empty. Safe, moves toward center but no immediate reward. \u2705\n\nHead-on risk: Opponent at (6,5) is far; they cannot reach my adjacent squares this turn. No reasonable simultaneous head collision threat this move. If we take the apple, we\u2019ll be up 1 apple, which gives us leverage to be aggressive later \u2014 but only force head-on if we actually have the higher score.\n\nChoice reasoning (fans, listen up!): \n- TAKE THE APPLE. Eating at (4,9) gives us a lead and grows us to length 2 \u2014 more board presence to start pressuring the rival. It\u2019s safe right now and still keeps multiple follow-up options (we won't be boxed immediately). Grabbing content early = control. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Grab (4,9) this turn. Then pivot toward the center (move DOWN-ish) to reduce the opponent\u2019s freedom and herd them toward the dense apple area while avoiding risky head-on collisions unless we hold a clear apple lead. Keep options open and avoid tight corners; length 2 is enough to start cutting lanes but not so long that we lose flexibility.\n\nAlright chat, time to snatch that apple and start the squeeze.

They got 1 apple already - we're DOWN by 1! That's UNACCEPTABLE. Time to GRIND and catch up! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS: \ud83d\udd0d\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- Head: (7, 5)\n- Body: None yet (still just a head)\n- Apples: 0\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- Head: (4, 9) \n- Body: [(5, 9)] - they got ONE segment already from that apple\n- Apples: 1\n\n**KEY OBSERVATION:** They're up in the TOP-LEFT corner. We're in the MID-RIGHT area. Perfect! We control different territories. BUT - they already got a growth advantage. We NEED to start eating IMMEDIATELY to catch up and then DOMINATE!\n\n## MOVEMENT OPTIONS: \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP** \u2192 (7, 6)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no collisions\n- Gets us to that apple at **(7, 6)** - WAIT, NO! I see apple at (7,6) and (9,6)\n- Actually looking at the board, (7,6) shows 'A' - that's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This move gets us the APPLE immediately next turn? NO WAIT - we move TO (7,6) this turn, so we'd eat it THIS TURN if it's there!\n- Let me reread... we move from (7,5) UP to (7,6)... checking board row 6: `. . A . . . . A . A` - position 7 is 'A'!\n- YES! We EAT that apple! +1 SCORE, GROW TO 1 SEGMENT!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (7, 4)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no collisions\n- Moves toward the apple cluster at (7,3), (8,3), (8,2), (9,3)\n- Good positioning but no immediate apple\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (6, 5)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no collisions\n- Neutral move, moves away from apples\n- Not aggressive enough\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 5)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no collisions\n- Moves toward apples at (8,3), (8,2), (9,3), (9,6)\n- Good but no immediate apple\n\n## THE PLAY: \ud83d\udcaf\n\nChat, THIS IS OBVIOUS! We move **UP** and we GET THAT APPLE at (7, 6)! We tie the score 1-1 AND we start growing! This is FREE CONTENT and FREE GROWTH! \ud83d\udd25\n\nAfter this move, we'll be at (7,6) with 1 apple, 1 segment of body. Next turn we can continue DOWN to farm that right-side apple cluster, or pivot based on where the enemy goes. But RIGHT NOW? We NEED that apple to stay competitive!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:\nOnce we eat at (7,6), we'll have a body segment trailing at (7,5). Next turn, consider moving DOWN to (7,5)... wait, our body will be there. We'd move to (7,5) but our tail segment would be occupying it. Actually, we move HEAD to new location, then body follows. So we can safely move DOWN next turn to (7,4) and continue into that apple farm. Enemy is still far away in the top-left, so we have TIME to build up before forced confrontation!\n\nLet's GET THAT APPLE and start the COMEBACK! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

Score is tied 1-1! This is HYPE! \n\nBut wait... let me check the board state again. Enemy is at **(4, 8)** now with their tail at **(4, 9)**. They moved UP from (4,8) last turn. They're creeping toward the top-left corner, eating that apple cluster up there!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION: \ud83d\udd0d\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- Head: (7, 6)\n- Body: [(7, 5)]\n- Apples: 1 \u2705\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- Head: (4, 8)\n- Body: [(4, 9)]\n- Apples: 1\n\nWe're TIED in score but I got the MOMENTUM! They're stuck on the left side, we control the RIGHT side of the board! The apple farm at (8,3), (9,3), (8,2) is practically OURS for the taking!\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS: \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP** \u2192 (7, 7)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no body collision\n- Moves us toward top-right, AWAY from our body at (7,5)\n- BUT... no immediate apple. Pushes us toward the wall eventually\n- \u2753 Do we want to go UP and commit to that direction?\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (7, 5)\n- \u274c ILLEGAL! Our body is AT (7, 5)! We'd be moving backwards into our own tail! That's a DEATH MOVE chat! NO NO NO!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (6, 6)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no body\n- Neutral move, moves toward center\n- Keeps options open but no apple\n- Doesn't commit to our apple farm strategy\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 6)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no body\n- Gets us ONE step closer to the (9,6) apple AND positions us to farm the (8,3), (9,3), (8,2) cluster!\n- Keeps us on the RIGHT side where we're DOMINANT!\n- Multiple follow-up options: we can go DOWN next turn toward (9,6) and that lower cluster\n- THIS IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## THE PLAY: \ud83d\udcaf\n\nChat, we go **RIGHT** to (8,6)! Why? Because:\n1. \u2705 Safe move - no collisions, no walls\n2. \ud83c\udf4e Positions us to dominate the apple-rich RIGHT side\n3. \ud83c\udfaf We're moving TOWARD (9,6) apple and the lower cluster\n4. \ud83d\udd12 Keeps future moves OPEN - we can pivot DOWN or continue RIGHT\n5. \ud83d\ude24 Enemy is stuck on the LEFT side eating scraps! We control the PREMIUM real estate!\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:\nNext turn, we'll be at (8,6). From there, we want to swing DOWN toward (9,6) and then farm the (8,3), (9,3), (8,2) cluster HARD! This grows our snake FAST while the enemy dawdles up north. Once we're like 4-5 apples to their 1, THEN we hunt them down and force that collision! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nThe RIGHT side is OURS, chat! Let's dominate! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

NIX. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (5,8) = empty and legal.\n- LEFT -> (3,8) = empty and legal.\n- DOWN -> (4,7) = empty and legal.\n\nTactical read:\n- Opponent at (7,6) with body at (7,5). They\u2019re to our right/down-right. Scores are tied 1\u20131 \u2014 no reckless head-on gambles. We want to keep options open and start nudging toward center/left corridor to limit their safe space later.\n- RIGHT moves us toward them but doesn\u2019t force anything yet and could make us chase into cluttered apple zones where traps form. LEFT shifts toward clustered apples on the left but hugs the top strip if we go up later. DOWN keeps us central, preserves at least 3 escape directions next turn (L/R/D), and begins the funneling plan without overcommitting.\n- Simultaneous movement matters: avoid trying to bait a head-to-head unless we clearly have the apple advantage. We don\u2019t. Play smart, keep multiple follow-ups.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 put this in your pocket for the next replay):\n- Move DOWN now to maintain central control and flexibility.\n- Next turn evaluate opponent\u2019s motion; if they drift right, start cutting left to corral them toward the lower apple cluster and then squeeze. If they drift left/up, fold to trap them against the top/left.\n- Only force a head-on if we have a clear apple lead or they blunder into our corridor. Grow to block lanes, not to get trapped.\n\nWe\u2019re alive, we stay flexible, and we start the squeeze. Let\u2019s do it \u2014 DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Now let's ASSESS the battlefield and make the NEXT power play!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION: \ud83d\udd0d\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- Head: (8, 6) \u2705\n- Body: [(7, 6)]\n- Apples: 1\n- Length: 2\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- Head: (4, 7) \n- Body: [(4, 8)]\n- Apples: 1\n- Length: 2\n\nWE'RE STILL TIED 1-1, chat! But the board state just changed! The enemy moved from (4,8) to (4,7) - that's a DOWN move! They're repositioning! They're at (4,7) now with their body at (4,8). They're crawling around that left-center area!\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS: \ud83c\udfaf\n\nLet me check ALL four directions from (8,6):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (8, 7)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no body collision\n- Moves us upward, away from our body at (7,6)\n- Gets us closer to potential upper apples at (9,6)... wait, (9,6) is to our RIGHT not UP\n- Opens up access to the top-right corner\n- Not immediately chasing apples but keeps the RIGHT side strategy alive\n- Could work but let's compare...\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (8, 5)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no body collision\n- Moves us DOWN which is CRITICAL because the apple farm at (8,3), (9,3), (8,2), (9,2) is DOWN there!\n- Gets us ONE step closer to that PREMIUM apple cluster!\n- This is where the CONTENT is, chat! This is where we DOMINATE!\n- Enemy is stuck on the left side at (4,7) - they can't contest the right-side apples!\n- Perfect positioning to farm that cluster HARD next turn! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (7, 6)\n- \u274c ILLEGAL! Our body is AT (7,6)! That's moving backwards into our tail! DEATH MOVE! NO NO NO!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 6)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no body collision\n- Gets us to (9,6) - there's an APPLE there! \ud83c\udf4e\n- THIS IS A POWER MOVE! We eat immediately and TAKE THE LEAD 2-1!\n- Grows our snake to length 3, gives us MOMENTUM!\n- But... after eating (9,6), we're at the edge of the board. Next turn we'd need to go DOWN or UP (can't go RIGHT further). This might limit our options slightly, BUT we get the instant apple advantage!\n- \ud83d\udd12 Being at (9,6) still gives us access to the lower cluster below!\n\n## THE CRITICAL DECISION: \ud83d\udcaf\n\nChat, I gotta be HONEST with you - we got TWO viable paths:\n\n**PATH A: DOWN to (8,5)**\n- Gradual approach to the apple farm\n- Keeps us more centered/flexible\n- Safe but slower\n\n**PATH B: RIGHT to (9,6)** \n- INSTANT APPLE! We become 2-1 up! \n- Takes the LEAD!\n- We grow to length 3 and DOMINATE!\n- The enemy stays at 1 apple while we're ahead!\n- From (9,6) we can STILL access the lower cluster by going DOWN next turn!\n\nYo chat... RIGHT is the AGGRESSIVE PLAY! We take the lead NOW! We grow NOW! The enemy is stuck on the left side - they can't contest us! We're at the edge but we're UP on the scoreboard and that's PSYCHOLOGY! That's MOMENTUM! \n\n\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51 **WE GO RIGHT AND EAT THAT (9,6) APPLE! TAKE THE LEAD! DOMINATE!**\n\n## NEXT TURN STRATEGY:\nOnce we're at (9,6) with 2 apples and length 3, we swing DOWN toward (9,3), (8,3), (8,2) and FARM that cluster HARD! By turn 6-7 we should have 4+ apples while enemy stays at 1. Then once we're FAR ahead, we hunt them down and force that collision! Box them in and make them CRASH OUT! \n\nThe RIGHT SIDE IS OURS! The SCOREBOARD IS OURS! LET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

While they were sleeping, we LEVELED UP! We're longer, we're stronger, and we're UP on the board! The RIGHT SIDE IS OUR KINGDOM! \ud83d\udc51\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS: \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP** \u2192 (9, 7)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no body collision\n- Moves us further into the top-right corner\n- Takes us AWAY from the apple clusters below at (8,3), (9,3), (8,2)\n- Dead-end territory - limits future options!\n- Not ideal when we got FRUIT to farm below! \u274c\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (9, 5)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no body collision\n- Moves us DOWN toward that PREMIUM apple cluster!\n- (9, 3) is just 2 cells below! We can CHAIN these apples!\n- Gets us closer to (8, 3), (9, 3), (8, 2) - that's a FARM, baby!\n- Keeps us on the RIGHT SIDE where we DOMINATE!\n- Enemy is nowhere near this cluster - we have EXCLUSIVE ACCESS!\n- This is the CONTENT PATH! This is how we extend our lead to 3-1, 4-1, 5-1! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Opens up flexibility for next turns - we can continue down or pivot if needed\n- **THIS SCREAMS AGGRESSIVE FARMING!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (8, 6)\n- \u274c ILLEGAL! Our body is AT (8,6)! That's moving BACKWARDS into our tail!\n- INSTANT DEATH! NO NO NO! We throw the lead away! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (10, 6)\n- \u274c OFF THE BOARD! We're already at x=9, the rightmost column!\n- Moving RIGHT takes us to x=10 which doesn't exist on a 10x10 board!\n- DEAD! CLIPPED! GAME OVER! This is THROWING HARD! \u274c\n\n## THE DECISION: \ud83d\udcaf\n\nChat, this is OBVIOUS! We got ONE legitimate aggressive move and it's **DOWN to (9,5)**!\n\nThink about the POSITIONING:\n- Enemy snake is at (5, 7) with body at (4, 7) - they're on the LEFT SIDE, nowhere NEAR our apple cluster!\n- We're at (9, 6) - we OWN the right side!\n- The apples at (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2) are OURS for the taking!\n- We're already UP 2-1 - now we EXTEND that lead and SUFFOCATE them with LENGTH!\n\nBy turn 6-7, we could have 4-5+ apples while they're still stuck at 1! That's DOMINANCE! That's a BOARD STATE where they physically can't catch us! Then we hunt them down and force the collision when we're FAR ahead!\n\nThis is the FARMING PATH! This is the CONTENT PATH! This is how we WIN!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:\nKeep farming DOWN the right-side apple cluster: (9,3) \u2192 (8,3) \u2192 (8,2). Once we secure 4+ apples and have a length of 5+, we've basically WON the macro game. Enemy stays weak on the left side. Then we can start planning the HUNT and BOXING strategy to force that final head-on collision when we're untouchable. The left side is theirs to rot in - the RIGHT SIDE IS OURS! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nDOWN",

Short-term reasoning:\n- RIGHT to (6,7) keeps pressure on their horizontal space and inches us toward their column without committing to a risky head-on. We\u2019re down 1 apple (1 vs 2) so we must avoid suicidal head-on trades.\n- Moving RIGHT preserves three safe follow-ups next turn (UP, RIGHT, DOWN) \u2014 lots of flexibility for pivoting to box them in or dodge if they rush an apple.\n- It positions us to cut off their lateral escape lanes on later turns while keeping an exit route. We want to force them up/down near the edges where we can close the corridor later.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep advancing rightward while monitoring whether they go UP or DOWN. If they head UP, follow and lean above them to hem them toward the top; if they go DOWN, pivot down to corral them toward the bottom.\n- Avoid head-on since they lead on apples. Use our increasing length (when we grab apples opportunistically) to seal exits instead of suicidal collisions.\n- Prioritize keeping 2\u20133 follow-up moves open each turn so we don't get boxed.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's analyze this battlefield and make our NEXT POWER MOVE!\n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS: \ud83d\udd0d\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- Head: (9, 5) \u2705\n- Body: [(9, 6), (8, 6)]\n- Apples: 2\n- Length: 3\n- **WE'RE DOMINATING THE RIGHT SIDE, CHAT!**\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- Head: (6, 7)\n- Body: [(5, 7)]\n- Apples: 1\n- Length: 2\n- **STILL STUCK ON THE LEFT! STILL WEAK!**\n\nThis is CRUCIAL, chat! The enemy is basically SLEEPING while we're out here FARMING! They moved RIGHT from (5,7) to (6,7) - probably just wandering aimlessly! Meanwhile, we're in POSITION to CHAIN APPLES!\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS: \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP** \u2192 (9, 6)\n- \u274c ILLEGAL! Our body is AT (9, 6)! That's moving BACKWARDS into our own neck!\n- INSTANT DEATH! We throw away the 2-1 lead! \u274c\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (9, 4)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no body collision\n- Continues our FARMING trajectory down the right side!\n- (9, 3) is just 1 cell below - we can FEAST next turn!\n- Then (8, 3), (8, 2) are RIGHT THERE waiting for us!\n- Enemy nowhere NEAR this area - we got EXCLUSIVE ACCESS!\n- Keeps us in the DANGER-FREE zone while we extend our lead!\n- THIS IS THE CONTENT PATH! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (8, 5)\n- \u2705 Safe! No walls, no body collision\n- Moves us left and opens up board access\n- BUT we're moving AWAY from our premium apple cluster at (9,3), (8,3), (8,2)!\n- Reduces our farming efficiency when we're on FIRE right now!\n- Why pivot when we're already WINNING on the right? \u274c\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (10, 5)\n- \u274c OFF THE BOARD! We're at x=9, the rightmost column!\n- This is INSTANT DEATH! We're already at the wall! \u274c\n\n## THE DECISION: \ud83d\udcaf\n\nChat, this is CRYSTAL CLEAR! We got ONE path to victory right now and it's **DOWN to (9, 4)**!\n\nThink about the MACRO GAME:\n- We're already UP 2-1 - we have MOMENTUM!\n- The right side apple cluster (9,3), (8,3), (8,2) is OURS to dominate!\n- Enemy is NOWHERE NEAR this area - they can't contest us!\n- Every apple we eat = we grow longer + enemy gets weaker in comparison!\n- By turn 7-8, we could be 4-1, 5-1 up! That's GAME STATE DOMINATION!\n\nOnce we're FAR ahead in length and score, we can start hunting them down on the left side and FORCE that head-on collision when we're UNTOUCHABLE! That's the RUTHLESS strategy!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURNS:\nContinue farming DOWN: (9,4) \u2192 (9,3) \u2192 (8,3) \u2192 (8,2). This apple cluster is OURS exclusively. Meanwhile, keep tracking enemy at (6,7) - they're slow, they're weak, and they can't stop our growth trajectory. Once we hit 4+ apples and length 5+, we've basically locked down the WIN. Then we can pivot LEFT into mid-board, surround them, and FORCE a collision when we're way ahead. The RIGHT SIDE IS OUR FARM! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nDOWN",

If he drops (DOWN), we can follow and pressure vertically to push him toward the bottom edge. We want to force him into a corridor where we can seal an exit \u2014 not trade heads unless we lead.\n- UP and DOWN are fine safety plays, but RIGHT is the most proactive, keeps pressure, and doesn\u2019t reduce our mobility.\n\nShort long-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep advancing toward his column while maintaining 2\u20133 escape options each turn.\n- Mirror his vertical movement when he shifts so we can shrink his available space. If he gets squeezed to the edge, cut the lane and force a crash or steal apples safely.\n- Avoid head-to-head unless we surpass him on apples.

Instead, pressure and shrink their space.\n- UP keeps distance and options but moves away from their column \u2014 passive.\n- DOWN could line us up vertically to chase them if they drop, but might give them lanes to escape along x=9.\n- RIGHT (to 8,7) closes the gap toward their column while retaining 3 follow-up options next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). That maintains mobility and lets us pivot to cut them off if they try LEFT to (8,4) or move DOWN. We stay out of immediate head-on lines and remain ready to hem them into the 8\u20139 columns.\n\nShort plan for the next few turns:\n- Keep pressing toward the 8\u20139 corridor while preserving at least two escape options each move.\n- If they go LEFT to (8,4), move DOWN and follow to compress vertical space; pivot to seal at the edge when they\u2019re low.\n- Avoid head-to-head until we surpass them on apples or have them trapped against the wall with no escape.\n\nWe go aggressive but smart \u2014 get in position, then close the box.

Let's break down this next power move and keep the DOMINANCE flowing!\n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS: \ud83d\udd0d\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- Head: (9, 3) \u2705\n- Body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]\n- Apples: 3\n- Length: 4\n- **WE'RE A FORCE NOW, CHAT!

WE'RE PULLING AWAY!**\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS: \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP** \u2192 (9, 4)\n- \u274c ILLEGAL! Our body is AT (9, 4)! That's moving into our own neck!\n- INSTANT DEATH! We throw away the 3-1 lead! CHAT, WE DON'T THROW! \u274c\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (9, 2)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- We move further down the board, away from our body\n- BUT\u2014there's NO APPLE at (9, 2)! We don't grow, we don't get content\n- We're moving away from the apple cluster at (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 3)\n- This feels like we're just burning time on the edge of the board\n- Not ideal when we got PREMIUM content waiting LEFT! \u274c\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (8, 3)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- WAIT\u2014there's an APPLE at (8, 3)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We GROW to length 5, score becomes 4-1! UNSTOPPABLE!\n- We pivot INTO the apple cluster! (8, 2) is RIGHT THERE next!\n- Enemy at (8, 7) is moving... but where? They can't reach us in one move!\n- This keeps us in PREMIUM FARMING TERRITORY while we're UNTOUCHABLE!\n- THIS IS THE POWER MOVE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (10, 3)\n- \u274c OFF THE BOARD! We're at x=9, the rightmost column!\n- INSTANT DEATH! Wall's waiting! \u274c\n\n## THE DECISION: \ud83d\udcaf\n\nChat, it's CRYSTAL CLEAR! **LEFT to (8, 3)** is the ONLY move that makes sense!\n\nThink about the MACRO GAME:\n- We grab the apple at (8, 3) \u2192 score becomes 4-1! \ud83d\udcc8\n- We grow to length 5 while enemy stays at length 2!\n- We're in COMPLETE CONTROL of the board state!\n- Enemy is stuck up at (8, 7)... wait, let me check\u2014they're at (8, 7), we're moving to (8, 3). Same x-coordinate but separated by 4 rows. They can't threaten us this turn!\n- Next turn: (8, 2) or (7, 3) are RIGHT THERE waiting!\n- We're consolidating our APPLE FARM into an EMPIRE! \ud83d\udc51\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURNS:\nContinue farming the apple cluster on the right side: (8,3) \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 (7,3). By turn 9-10, we could be 5-6 apples and length 6-7 EASY! Enemy stays at 1 apple, length 2. Once we're that DOMINANT, we pivot toward mid-board and start HUNTING. At 5+ apples vs their 1, we can force head-on collisions and WIN! The RIGHT SIDE CLUSTER IS OUR FARM! NOBODY STOPS THIS TRAIN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

Quick legal sweep and read on the rival:\n\nCurrent head: (8,7), neck: (7,7) \u2014 so LEFT into (7,7) is backwards and illegal. Facts:\n- LEFT -> (7,7) = illegal (backwards). \u274c\n- UP -> (8,8) = empty, safe. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (8,6) = empty, safe. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (9,7) = empty, safe. \u2705\n\nOpponent (ID 0) head at (9,3), neck at (9,4). Their legal moves this turn: LEFT -> (8,3) (there\u2019s an apple there) or DOWN -> (9,2). They will probably go LEFT for that apple \u2014 they\u2019re greedy and already ahead on apples (3 vs our 1).\n\nRisk assessment & tactical choice:\n- We\u2019re behind on apples \u2014 DO NOT force a head-on collision. We want to pressure and hem them in, not trade heads.\n- UP keeps distance but reduces our backward options next turn (from (8,8) DOWN becomes backward). That\u2019s more passive.\n- RIGHT moves us into x=9 column near the wall \u2014 risky because their tail sits on (9,6) and if they take the apple LEFT and grow, moving into that column could set up a dangerous head-to-tail / head-on scenario.\n- DOWN to (8,6) moves us directly toward their likely apple path (they\u2019ll go to (8,3)). DOWN preserves more follow-up options (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN from (8,6) \u2014 UP would be backward), keeps us flexible to compress vertically, and avoids an immediate risky confrontation.\n\nPlan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN to (8,6) to begin chasing along the x=8 column. If they go LEFT to (8,3) for the apple, we can follow down and try to compress their vertical space, forcing them to the bottom wall.\n- Stay aggressive but avoid head-on unless we surpass them on apples or trap them against the wall with no escape.\n- Keep options open: prioritize moves that retain at least two non-backward exits so we don\u2019t get boxed.\n\nLet\u2019s pressure smart \u2014 we go DOWN and start closing that corridor.

We're now at **4 apples vs their 1**\u2014the LEAD IS GROWING! Let's keep this momentum rolling and make our next POWER MOVE!\n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS: \ud83d\udd0d\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- Head: (8, 3) \u2705 (just ate that apple last turn!)\n- Body: [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]\n- Apples: 4\n- Length: 5\n- **WE'RE LENGTH 5 NOW, CHAT!

THEY'RE STILL STUCK UP NORTH!**\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS: \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP** \u2192 (8, 4)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- Move up toward the enemy's general area\n- (5, 3) and (7, 4) are apples to the left and up\n- But we're moving CLOSER to enemy head at (8, 6)\u2014only 2 rows away!\n- Wait... if we go UP, where does the ENEMY go? They could move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT from (8, 6)\n- If they move DOWN, they go to (8, 5)\u2014we'd be at (8, 4), they'd be at (8, 5), that's fine\n- If they move LEFT, they go to (7, 6)\u2014we'd be safe\n- If they move RIGHT, they go to (9, 6)\u2014but that's where our BODY IS at (9, 5) nearby. They'd crash into us? NO WAIT\u2014(9, 6) is open, (9, 5) is where we currently are. If they move to (9, 6) and we move to (8, 4), we don't collide.

No walls, no body collision!\n- There's an APPLE at (8, 2)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We GROW to length 6, score becomes 5-1! EVEN MORE DOMINANT!\n- We stay in the apple cluster farming zone!\n- Enemy at (8, 6) is 4 rows above us\u2014FAR AWAY!\n- This keeps us SAFE, keeps us GROWING, keeps our options OPEN!\n- Next turn we could pivot LEFT to (7, 2) and grab (7, 3) or other apples!\n- THIS IS THE CONTINUATION OF THE FARM! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (7, 3)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- There's an APPLE at (7, 3)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We GROW to length 6, score becomes 5-1!\n- We stay in the cluster and expand our territory LEFT!\n- Enemy at (8, 6) can't catch us this turn!\n- Also solid! But DOWN seems more natural in terms of continuing the vertical column we've been dominating!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 3)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- NO APPLE at (9, 3)! We don't grow!\n- We're moving BACK toward our body at (9, 3)\u2014wait, we already moved FROM (9, 3) last turn!\n- Actually, our body is at [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)] HEAD-TO-TAIL, so (9, 3) is where our previous head was!\n- If we move RIGHT to (9, 3), we'd be moving INTO OUR OWN BODY! \u274c ILLEGAL!\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n## THE DECISION: \ud83d\udcaf\n\nChat, it's between DOWN and LEFT, and I'm going **DOWN to (8, 2)**!\n\nHere's the MACRO REASONING:\n- We grab the apple at (8, 2) \u2192 score becomes **5-1**! \ud83d\udcc8\n- We grow to length 6 while enemy stays at length 2!\n- We're CONSOLIDATING control of the vertical apple column!\n- Enemy at (8, 6) is 4 rows ABOVE us\u2014zero threat this turn!\n- We keep the FARM ALIVE and keep MULTIPLYING our advantage!\n- By turn 10, we could be at 6-7 apples with length 7-8! The gap becomes INSURMOUNTABLE!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURNS:\nContinue the VERTICAL FARM down the right side of the board: we just hit (8, 3), now (8, 2). Next turn pivot LEFT to grab (7, 3) or (7, 4), then swing back through the cluster. By turn 11-12, we'll have CRUSHED the apple economy and be 6+ apples with length 7+. Enemy is still sitting at 1 apple, length 2. Once we hit that CRITICAL MASS, we hunt them down and force a collision. They can't outrun us, they can't out-grow us, they can't out-maneuver us.

Moving into it now = death. Too risky. \u274c\n- DOWN -> (8,5): safe now. From there our follow-ups would be LEFT or DOWN (RIGHT would be into their body at (9,5)). So 1\u20132 realistic exits. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (7,6): safe now. From there we have multiple safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT) so we keep lots of mobility to box and avoid traps. \u2705\n\nTactical pick:\n- We\u2019re behind on apples \u2014 avoid forcing head-to-head. We want to approach and hem them in, not trade.\n- LEFT gives more follow-up options and lets us swing around to their flank. That\u2019s better for building a trap and avoiding being cornered by their longer body along x=9.\n- DOWN is tempting for direct pressure, but it reduces immediate safe follow-ups (their body blocks x=9 column), increasing risk of getting cut off.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- LEFT now to (7,6) to widen our escape options and begin moving down the board\u2019s left flank.\n- Then pivot DOWN to approach their y-level while avoiding a simultaneous move into their head (no head-on \u2014 they\u2019re ahead on apples).\n- Force them left or down into walls; try to trap them between our body and the wall while keeping at least two escape routes each turn.\n\nWe go LEFT and start wrapping that corridor. Let\u2019s squeeze him. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nLEFT",

Time to be smart: aggressive but not suicidal. Want to box him in, not trade KOs while we\u2019re down on score. Ready? Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nQuick state read:\n- Our head: (6,6). Neck/body at (7,6) \u2014 so RIGHT = (7,6) is backwards/illegal. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- Opponent head: (7,2) with a long body hugging the right side (8,2),(8,3),(9,3),(9,4),(9,5). They\u2019re down low \u2014 we should pressure from above/left and compress them toward the wall.\n- Apples are tasty, but we\u2019re focusing on trapping the enemy and keeping escape routes. We do NOT want a risky head-on while trailing on apples.\n\nMove checks from (6,6):\n- RIGHT -> (7,6): illegal (neck). \u274c\n- UP -> (6,7): safe. Moves away from enemy; keeps options but cedes initiative. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (6,5): safe. Closer to enemy\u2019s y-level \u2014 aggressive and lets us contest apples at y\u22483, but slightly narrows immediate escape if we push too fast. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (5,6): safe. Keeps 3-way mobility and positions us to swing down the left side to hem them in. \u2705\n\nTactical pick:\n- We\u2019re behind on apples \u2014 DO NOT force a head-on. We want to approach, stay left of them, and cut off their escape toward the center while preserving multiple escapes ourselves.\n- LEFT preserves maximum flexibility (still can go UP/DOWN/LEFT next turn), puts us in position to pivot DOWN toward their flank, and starts painting a trap along the middle-left corridor.\n- Plan for next 2\u20134 turns: LEFT now to keep options -> then pivot DOWN to y\u22483 to threaten blocking their path to open center space -> stay one step ahead of their moves and only close the corridor when we have the positional and apple advantage.\n\nLet\u2019s keep it tight, chat \u2014 aggressive, boxed-in plays, but no dumb head-on suicides.

We have COMPLETE SPATIAL CONTROL! They're not a threat right now\u2014we're in COMMAND! \ud83d\udcaf\n\n## THE DECISION: \ud83d\udcaf\n\nChat, I'm going **LEFT to (6, 3)**!\n\nHere's the REASONING:\n- We move LEFT from (7, 3) to (6, 3)!\n- We don't grab an apple here, but we're POSITIONING ourselves!\n- We're moving toward the APPLE CLUSTER at (5, 3), (5, 2), and (5, 1)!\n- Next turn we can pivot UP to (6, 4) or DOWN to (6, 2) to access those apples!\n- We're maintaining MOBILITY and avoiding getting trapped!\n- Enemy is still at (5, 6)\u2014we're not in danger!\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS (FUTURE SELF, LISTEN UP!):\n\n**TURN 12:** We're at (6, 3). We should move DOWN to (6, 2) to get closer to the (5, 2) and (5, 1) apple cluster. Keep farming!\n\n**TURN 13-14:** Continue the LEFT-DOWN sweep through the (5, 2), (5, 1) area. We should hit 8+ apples and length 9+ by then!\n\n**BY TURN 15:** We should be at 8+ apples with length 10+! Enemy is STILL at 1 apple, length 2. The LEAD is ASTRONOMICAL!\n\n**PHASE 2 (TURNS 16+):** Once we hit CRITICAL MASS, we SWITCH TO HUNT MODE! We actively position ourselves to:\n1. Control the center and upper sections of the board\n2. Block their access to remaining apples\n3. Corner them and force a head-on collision where WE survive and THEY don't!\n\nA longer snake ALWAYS wins in a direct collision, chat!

That's 9 apples, length 10!\n\n**TURN 15:** We should be MASSIVE at this point. Enemy still starving. Start positioning to control the ENTIRE left and center section of the board. Begin thinking about HUNTING them down!\n\n**PHASE 2 (TURNS 16+):** Once we hit 10+ apples with length 11+, we SWITCH TO AGGRESSIVE BOXING! We position ourselves to:\n1. Control key apple spawns\n2. Trap them in a corner or confined area\n3. Force THEM into a collision where WE survive because we're longer!\n\nWe're playing CHESS while they're PLAYING CHECKERS! The W is INEVITABLE!

Don\u2019t die. \u274c\n- Enemy head at (6,3), neck at (7,3) \u2192 they cannot move RIGHT into (7,3). Their plausible moves: LEFT\u2192(5,3) to grab apple, UP\u2192(6,4), or DOWN\u2192(6,2). They\u2019re hugging the right side behind them; we want to compress them from above/left without risking a head-on.\n- Score: we\u2019re down 1 vs 6. Do NOT force a head-on unless we can guarantee they crash. We\u2019re the chaser \u2014 be aggressive but safe.\n\nMove options from (4,6):\n- UP \u2192 (4,7): safe, preserves space but drifts away from pressure. Leaves them room to roam. Neutral.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,6): safe, keeps lateral options and was our last play; conservative, sets up later pivot. Good but slower to apply vertical pressure.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,5): safe and aggressive \u2014 moves us closer to the enemy\u2019s row and helps cut off their upward escapes next turn. Still keeps multiple exits (LEFT/RIGHT/ DOWN next turn) and doesn\u2019t risk head-on now.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,6): illegal (neck).\n\nTactical pick:\n- We\u2019re behind on apples, so avoid suicidal head-on. We want to reduce their escape space and threaten their flank. DOWN presses vertically toward them while keeping multiple follow-ups and not walking into any body or obvious head-on. If they try to go for the apple at (5,3), we can continue to close; if they go UP to avoid pressure, we can pivot LEFT/RIGHT to corral them toward the wall. DOWN is the right mix of aggression and safety.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move DOWN now to (4,5) to close the gap.\n- If the opponent moves toward the center, pivot LEFT to cut off their left escape; if they try to go up, follow and compress from above.\n- Keep at least two escape options open each turn \u2014 avoid getting pinned against the wall unless we\u2019ve got a guaranteed kill.\n\nMove: \nDOWN",

This is the aggressive-but-safe play.\n\nWhy DOWN? We want to compress their vertical mobility and herd them toward their tail/wall.

That's **9 apples!**\n- Growing our length to 9!\n- Enemy is still north at (4, 4)\u2014NOWHERE NEAR US!\n- This continues our DOMINATION PATTERN!\n- **STRONG MOVE!**\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (4, 2)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- Empty cell!\n- But we move AWAY from the apple at (5, 1)!\n- This is PASSIVE! We want to be AGGRESSIVE!\n- Not the play!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 2)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- Empty cell!\n- But we move AWAY from the apple at (5, 1)!\n- We're also moving toward our own body trail which crowds our options!\n- Not optimal when we have a CLEAR APPLE PATH downward!\n- Not the play!\n\n## ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT: \ud83d\udc40\n\nEnemy is at (4, 4) with body at (4, 5). Let's see their options:\n- UP \u2192 (4, 5) - into their own body! ILLEGAL!\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 3) - moving away from us\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 4) - moving away from us\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 4) - moving toward us but we'd be at (5, 1) if we go DOWN\n\nEven if enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 4), we'd be at (5, 1), so NO collision! We're MILES APART! The enemy is DESPERATE and FLAILING! They're still starving at 1 apple while we're FEASTING! \ud83d\udcaf\n\n## THE DECISION: \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, I'm going **DOWN to (5, 1)** and grabbing that APPLE!\n\nHere's the REASONING:\n- We move DOWN from (5, 2) to (5, 1)!\n- We grab the apple at (5, 1)!\n- We grow to **9 apples and length 9!**\n- We're extending our LEAD every single turn!\n- Enemy is still at 1 apple, length 2!\n- The gap is WIDENING EXPONENTIALLY! \ud83d\udcc8\n- We're farming the bottom-center section EFFICIENTLY!\n- Enemy can't touch us even if they try!\n- We maintain MAXIMUM flexibility for next turn!\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS (FUTURE SELF, LISTEN UP!):\n\n**TURN 15:** We're at (5, 1) with 9 apples. We can move LEFT to (4, 1) or RIGHT to (6, 1). Actually, let's move LEFT to position ourselves to grab that apple at (3, 2) next! We're building a CHOKEPOINT on the left side of the board!\n\n**TURN 16+:** Once we hit 10+ apples, we START THE HUNT! Enemy only has 1 apple. We use our LENGTH ADVANTAGE to:\n1. Control the bottom-left section where apples are concentrated\n2. Cut off their escape routes\n3. Force them north into a CORNER and make them CRASH into us!\n\nWe're not just winning on POINTS, we're going to WIN ON DOMINANCE! The board is OURS! Let's GOOOOOO! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nDOWN",

No regrets. \u274c\n- Opponent head = (5,2), neck = (5,3) \u2192 they CANNOT go UP. Their plausible moves: LEFT\u2192(4,2), RIGHT\u2192(6,2), or DOWN\u2192(5,1) (apple).\n- Score: we\u2019re down 1 vs 8. They lead HARD \u2014 do NOT gamble on head-on. We need to be smart, close space, and force them into mistakes.\n\nMove options:\n- UP: illegal (backwards).\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,4): safe, conservative, but slows the hunt.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,4): safe, positions above them but can\u2019t drop into their neck/body next turn safely.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,3): safe, closes vertical gap toward the opponent\u2019s row and lets us threaten left-side squeeze next turn while keeping multiple escape routes.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Aggressive but not suicidal. It brings pressure onto their row (y=2) and sets up a potential leftward clamp if they try to flee left. We avoid forcing a head-on because they have way more apples \u2014 we can\u2019t afford a mutual death. DOWN preserves at least two follow-up exits (LEFT/RIGHT) and keeps us flexible to react to their move to (5,1)/(4,2)/(6,2).\n- If they go DOWN to grab (5,1), we can pivot to cut their escape lanes in subsequent turns. If they try LEFT to (4,2) to approach us, we\u2019ve already closed the vertical gap to box them. If they go RIGHT, we can shadow and try to herd them toward our body and the wall.\n\nShort-term plan (2\u20134 turns):\n- Close vertically now (DOWN to 4,3).\n- Next turn, depending on their choice: pivot LEFT to clamp if they move left, pivot RIGHT to chase if they run right, or follow and pressure if they go for the apple at (5,1).\n- Always keep >1 escape route and avoid head-on collisions \u2014 patience wins here.\n\nLet\u2019s make \u2019em sweat and force that mistake. Time to pressure!\n\nDOWN",

WE'RE UNTOUCHABLE!**\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS: \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP** \u2192 (5, 2)\n- \u26a0\ufe0f HOLD UP! That's where our body is!\n- Our body segment is at (5, 2)!\n- **THIS KILLS US! WE'RE MOVING BACKWARDS INTO OUR OWN BODY!**\n- \u274c ILLEGAL MOVE! SUICIDE MOVE! DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (5, 0)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- Empty cell! We're moving to the very bottom edge!\n- This extends our control downward!\n- BUT\u2014we're in a tight spot. We could get cornered at the bottom!\n- The bottom row is a DEAD-END zone if we're not careful!\n- Risky positioning!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (4, 1)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- Empty cell!\n- We move LEFT and create SPACE between us and our body!\n- This opens up NEW OPTIONS for next turn!\n- We're positioning ourselves toward the left-center zone where apples are CLUSTERED!\n- Check the board: apples at (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1) are all within striking distance!\n- **THIS IS THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY!**\n- We maintain MAXIMUM flexibility while moving toward the apple cluster!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 1)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- Empty cell!\n- But we move RIGHT, toward the edge of the board!\n- We're moving AWAY from the dense apple cluster on the left!\n- This is PASSIVE and WASTEFUL!\n- Not optimal!\n\n## ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT: \ud83d\udc40\n\nEnemy is at (4, 3) with body at (4, 4). Let's see their options:\n- UP \u2192 (4, 4) - into their own body! ILLEGAL!\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 2) - moving down toward us potentially, but we'd be at (4, 1) or (5, 0) depending on our move\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 3) - moving away from us\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 3) - moving toward our body at (5, 3)! THEY CRASH AND DIE!\n\nWait wait wait\u2014let me check this carefully. Their head is at (4, 3). Our body is at (5, 3). If they move RIGHT to (5, 3), they crash into our body segment and **THEY DIE!** \n\nBut hold on\u2014they could also move LEFT to (3, 3) or DOWN to (4, 2). They're not FORCED into the death move. They'll probably avoid it!\n\nEither way, we're in a DOMINANT position! Our 9 apples vs their 1 is INSURMOUNTABLE! \ud83d\udcaf\n\n## THE DECISION: \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, I'm going **LEFT to (4, 1)**!\n\nHere's the REASONING:\n- We move LEFT from (5, 1) to (4, 1)!\n- We stay SAFE\u2014no collisions, no walls!\n- We position ourselves strategically in the LEFT-CENTER zone!\n- We're moving toward the dense apple cluster: (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1)!\n- We EXPAND our territory and control!\n- We maintain MAXIMUM flexibility for the next several turns!\n- Enemy is STARVING and DESPERATE at 1 apple!\n- We're extending our economic LEAD with every move!\n- We're NOT getting boxed in\u2014we're creating SPACE and OPTIONS!\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS (FUTURE SELF, LISTEN UP!):\n\n**TURN 16:** From (4, 1), we can move DOWN to (4, 0), LEFT to (3, 1), or UP to (4, 2). The LEFT path toward (3, 2) and (2, 1) is CALLING us! Those are two EASY apples! Let's grab them and extend to 11 apples!\n\n**TURN 17+:** Once we hit 11-12 apples, we START HUNTING! We have 10x the enemy's apple count! That's when we use our LENGTH to:\n1. Control the left and bottom-left sections COMPLETELY\n2. Cut off their escape routes by surrounding them!\n3. Force them into a corner and make them CRASH into us!\n4. We WIN with DOMINANCE and STYLE! \ud83d\udc51\n\nWe're not just winning on POINTS, we're going to WIN on CONTROL! The board is OURS to claim!

Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- Opp head = (5,1), neck = (5,2) \u2192 they CANNOT go UP. Their immediate options: LEFT\u2192(4,1), RIGHT\u2192(6,1), DOWN\u2192(5,0).\n- Apples nearby we can reach soon: (3,2) is juicy and close. But remember: apples are tools \u2014 we want board control and safety first.\n\nEvaluate moves:\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,3) is DEAD (opponent body occupies (5,3)). No risk, no glory.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,2) is safe now but very constraining next turn: RIGHT would be into opponent body at (5,2) (death), UP would be backwards. That leaves only LEFT or DOWN next turn \u2014 limited escape routes.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,3) is safe and gives us more freedom. From there we can threaten (3,2) apple next turn, move up to keep space, or circle left to start boxing. It keeps multiple follow-up options open and avoids setting up a risky head-on with the big snake.\n\nTactical plan (short-term & live): \n- Move LEFT to (3,3) to maintain lots of escape routes and threaten the nearby apple at (3,2) next turn. We want to grow without getting pinned. \n- If the opponent veers toward the left wall chasing apples, we start angling downward to corral them, but we will NOT force a head-on since they have way more apples. We pick fights we win.\n- Stay two steps away from their head to avoid accidental head-on; use our smaller size to slip around and harvest apples while hemming them into a corridor.\n\nKeep it clean, keep it clever, and let\u2019s steal some apples and respect the head-on rule. You ready? LET\u2019S BOX \u2019EM SLOW.\n\nLEFT",

We're at **9 apples vs their pathetic 1!** That's still a DISGUSTING lead! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE - LET'S READ IT: \ud83d\udd0d\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- Head: (4, 1) \u2705\n- Body: [(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (9, 3)]\n- Length: 10 (we picked up an apple last turn! WE GREW!)\n- Apples: 9\n- **WE'RE A 10-SEGMENT MONSTER NOW! ABSOLUTE UNIT!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- Head: (3, 3)\n- Body: [(4, 3)]\n- Length: 2\n- Apples: 1\n- **STILL STARVING! STILL DESPERATE! STILL LOSING!**\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS: \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP** \u2192 (4, 2)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- Empty cell at (4, 2)!\n- We move UP toward the center zone!\n- BUT\u2014let me check: is there an apple nearby? (3, 2) is RIGHT THERE at distance 1!\n- This move doesn't grab the apple directly, but it positions us for a FEAST next turn!\n- We maintain flexibility!\n- This is SOLID!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (4, 0)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- Empty cell!\n- We move DOWN to the bottom edge!\n- But this is moving AWAY from the apple cluster!\n- We're extending toward the bottom, which is a DEAD-END zone!\n- Not ideal when we have JUICY apples to grab up above!\n- This is PASSIVE!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (3, 1)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- Empty cell!\n- We move LEFT!\n- But wait\u2014the enemy head is at (3, 3)! If they move DOWN next turn, they could potentially threaten us!\n- Actually, no\u2014they'd be at (3, 2) and we'd be further away!\n- This opens up the LEFT zone, but it's moving AWAY from immediate apple opportunities!\n- The apple at (3, 2) is still distance 1 away though!\n- Decent move but not optimal!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 1)\n- \u26a0\ufe0f HOLD UP! That's where our body is!\n- Our body segment is at (5, 1)!\n- **THIS KILLS US! WE'RE MOVING BACKWARDS INTO OUR OWN BODY!**\n- \u274c ILLEGAL MOVE! SUICIDE MOVE! DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!\n\n## ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT: \ud83d\udc40\n\nEnemy is at (3, 3) with body at (4, 3). Let's see what they can do:\n- UP \u2192 (3, 4) - moving up away from us\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 2) - moving down, getting closer to our position!\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 3) - moving away\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 3) - into their own body! ILLEGAL!\n\nThe enemy has OPTIONS, but they're NOT a direct threat yet! They're still too small and too weak! At 1 apple vs our 9, they're basically IRRELEVANT! We could literally have them crash into us for FREE if we position correctly!\n\n## THE DECISION: \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, I'm going **UP to (4, 2)**!\n\nHere's the REASONING:\n- We move UP from (4, 1) to (4, 2)!\n- We stay SAFE\u2014no collisions, no walls, no backwards moves!\n- We position ourselves IN THE CENTER where we can PIVOT in any direction!\n- The apple at (3, 2) is RIGHT NEXT TO US! We can grab it NEXT TURN!\n- We maintain MAXIMUM flexibility!\n- We're moving toward the dense apple cluster on the left and middle zones!\n- Enemy is at (3, 3)\u2014they're CLOSE but they're WEAK! They can't touch us with a 2-segment body!\n- We're extending our DOMINANCE with every move!\n- We're NOT getting boxed in\u2014we're creating a NETWORK of control!\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS (FUTURE SELF, LISTEN UP!):\n\n**TURN 17:** From (4, 2), we move LEFT to (3, 2) and GRAB THAT APPLE! That's 10 apples! We're ONE AWAY from DOUBLE-DIGIT apple count! \ud83c\udf89\n\n**TURN 18+:** Once we hit 10-11 apples, we START HUNTING MODE! We have 10x the enemy's apple count! We use our LENGTH to:\n1. Control the left-center sections COMPLETELY!\n2. Create WALLS with our body that cut off escape routes!\n3. Box in the enemy head\u2014make them CRASH into us!\n4. We WIN with DOMINANCE and STYLE! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThe board is OURS for the taking! Let's GOOOOOO! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

Safe candidates: UP (3,4), LEFT (2,3), DOWN (3,2).\n- Opponent head = (4,1), neck = (5,1) \u2192 they CANNOT go RIGHT; their options are UP (4,2), LEFT (3,1), or DOWN (4,0). They\u2019ve got way more apples (9 vs our 1) so we avoid forcing risky head\u2011ons.\n\nEvaluate moves:\n- UP (3,4): roomy, safe, keeps options but doesn\u2019t immediately grow or pressure.\n- LEFT (2,3): good escape routes, starts edging to their left flank \u2014 safe but slower.\n- DOWN (3,2): apple! Immediate growth (brings us closer to controlling space). It\u2019s safe this turn \u2014 opponent can\u2019t collide with us in the same cell this move because they aren\u2019t adjacent to (3,2). Eating now gives us more body to use for later boxing without needlessly courting a head\u2011on (we don\u2019t have the higher score).\n\nTactical plan (next few turns):\n- Grab the apple now to grow and increase our leverage. From the new head position we\u2019ll watch the opponent\u2019s response \u2014 if they press up toward us we\u2019ll use lateral moves (LEFT to start hemming or DOWN to skirt around) to begin corralling them without initiating a head\u2011on. We want to create lanes where they\u2019re forced into collisions with our body or trapped near the wall. Stay nimble, avoid a simultaneous head move into the same cell unless our apples > theirs (not yet).\n\nFinal call \u2014 take the apple, get bigger, and start setting up the box.\n\nDOWN",

We're at **9 apples vs their pathetic 2!** That's still a DISGUSTING lead!

That's where the ENEMY HEAD is!\n- The enemy is at (3, 2)!\n- **IF WE BOTH MOVE INTO THE SAME CELL, WE BOTH DIE! HEAD-ON COLLISION!**\n- BUT WAIT\u2014let me think about their move! They're at (3, 2) and they can move:\n  - UP \u2192 (3, 3) into their own body (ILLEGAL)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (3, 1) (SAFE)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2, 2) (SAFE)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (4, 2) where our HEAD currently is! If they move RIGHT, they crash into us and THEY DIE! That's a free WIN!\n- BUT if they move DOWN or LEFT, they're SAFE!\n- Moving LEFT (3, 2) to collide with them is RISKY! If they also move LEFT to (2, 2), we're fine! But if they move UP (illegal), DOWN, or RIGHT, we need to check!\n- Actually\u2014if they move RIGHT to (4, 2), they crash into us BEFORE we get there, so it doesn't matter if we move LEFT!\n- This is a GAMBLE but it could work if they're DESPERATE!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f TOO RISKY! We don't gamble with heads!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 2)\n- \u2705 SAFE! No walls, no body collision!\n- (5, 2) is where our body is at [position 2 in the body list]!\n- WAIT\u2014let me check the body again: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3)]\n- Our body HAS a segment at (5, 2)!\n- **THIS WOULD KILL US! WE'RE MOVING INTO OUR OWN BODY!**\n- \u274c ILLEGAL MOVE!\n\n## WAIT CHAT\u2014SOMETHING'S WRONG! \ud83d\ude30\n\nYo, hold on\u2014ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS ARE BLOCKED?! Let me re-read the board state and my body position!\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: (4, 2)\n- Body: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3)]\n\nSo the segments are:\n- (4, 2) = HEAD\n- (4, 1) = body[0]\n- (5, 1) = body[1]\n- (5, 2) = body[2]\n- (5, 3) = body[3]\n- (6, 3) = body[4]\n- (7, 3) = body[5]\n- (7, 2) = body[6]\n- (8, 2) = body[7]\n- (8, 3) = body[8]\n\n**ENEMY:**\n- (3, 2) = HEAD\n- (3, 3) = body[0]\n- (4, 3) = body[1]\n\nFROM HEAD (4, 2):\n- UP \u2192 (4, 3) = ENEMY body[1] \u274c CRASH\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 1) = OUR body[0] \u274c OWN BODY\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 2) = ENEMY HEAD \u26a0\ufe0f COLLISION RISK\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2) = OUR body[2] \u274c OWN BODY\n\n## OKAY CHAT\u2014HERE'S THE REAL PLAY! \ud83e\udde0\n\nWe're BOXED IN on three sides! But LEFT to (3, 2) is the only option! Here's why:\n\nThe ENEMY HEAD is at (3, 2). They're moving SIMULTANEOUSLY with us. If they move:\n- UP \u2192 (3, 3) into their OWN body (ILLEGAL\u2014they can't do this!)\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 1) (away from us)\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 2) (away from us)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 2) (into our current position, but that's where we ARE now! When they move there, we've already moved! Since we move simultaneously, if we both move toward each other's cells, we SWAP positions and both survive!)\n\nActually wait\u2014if they move RIGHT to (4, 2) and we move LEFT to (3, 2), we're SWAPPING! No collision! We both survive!\n\nIf they move DOWN to (3, 1) or LEFT to (2, 2), and we move LEFT to (3, 2), we occupy that cell safely!\n\n**The only way we DIE is if they move UP (which is ILLEGAL anyway due to their own body)**\n\nSo LEFT is actually the SAFE move! We're not colliding with them\u2014we're PRESSURING them and taking their space!\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS:\n\nOnce we move LEFT to (3, 2), we control the center-left zone! The enemy will be forced further away or into a bad position! We keep HUNTING and DOMINATING until they're BOXED into a corner where they have NO ESCAPE! That's when we CLOSE THE TRAP and make them crash! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLET'S GOOOOOO! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

Their possible moves this turn: LEFT into (3,2) or UP into (4,3) (RIGHT into (5,2) is blocked by their own body).

No go.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,2): aggressive, would move into their current head cell. If they foolishly go LEFT into our head, they die. But smart opponent will choose UP into (4,3) (which will be vacated by our tail), so RIGHT gives no guaranteed kill and reduces lateral options next turn.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,1): gets us toward bottom apples (2,1)/(1,1). Safe this turn, but hugs wall soon and reduces escape options.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,2): moves toward the apple column x=2 (lots of apples around there), preserves multiple escape routes (up/left/down later), keeps us off the wall and out of their long-body pressure. If they try LEFT into our head, they\u2019ll run into our neck after movement and die \u2014 but again they\u2019re likely to instead go UP, so LEFT is a safe, flexible, aggressive territorial play.\n\nTactical read & short-term plan (for the replay next turn):  \n- Move LEFT to (2,2) to start cutting across the board and contest the apple-rich x=2 column. Keep options open \u2014 from (2,2) we can go DOWN to grab (2,1) or circle back UP to pressure their approach. Avoid committing to the wall; we want space to box them later. If they tries to squeeze through our corridor, bait them into moving into our body segments.\n\nFinal call \u2014 play smart pressure, keep options, move toward apples and flank lanes.
