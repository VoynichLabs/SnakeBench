This is perfect - I just need to move DOWN twice to reach it.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (1, 3), it's quite close to me (just 1 unit to the left and 1 unit down). I need to be careful about potential collisions, but since we're both single segments, the risk is manageable.\n\nChecking all possible moves from (2, 4):\n- UP: (2, 5) - safe, but moves away from target apple\n- DOWN: (2, 3) - safe, gets me closer to apple at (2, 2)\n- LEFT: (1, 4) - safe, but doesn't help reach the closest apple\n- RIGHT: (3, 4) - safe, but moves away from target apple\n\nThe enemy snake at (1, 3) could potentially move UP to (1, 4), RIGHT to (2, 3), or DOWN to (1, 2). If it moves RIGHT to (2, 3), that would be exactly where I want to go. However, since we're making moves simultaneously, if we both move to (2, 3), we'd collide and both die.\n\nBut I think the enemy snake is more likely to go for the apple at (1, 0) since it's relatively close, or try to block me. The risk of collision at (2, 3) exists but I think it's worth taking since getting the first apple is crucial for early game advantage.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (2, 3), move DOWN again to (2, 2) to collect the apple. Then reassess the board situation and enemy position.\n\nDOWN"

          "rationale": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nMy snake (ID 0) is at position (2, 3) with no body segments.\nEnemy snake (ID 1) is at position (1, 2) with no body segments.\n\nAvailable apples:\n- (1, 0) - distance: \u221a((2-1)\u00b2 + (3-0)\u00b2) = \u221a(1+9) = \u221a10 \u2248 3.16\n- (1, 7) - distance: \u221a((2-1)\u00b2 + (3-7)\u00b2) = \u221a(1+16) = \u221a17 \u2248 4.12\n- (2, 2) - distance: \u221a((2-2)\u00b2 + (3-2)\u00b2) = \u221a(0+1) = 1.00\n- (7, 9) - distance: \u221a((2-7)\u00b2 + (3-9)\u00b2) = \u221a(25+36) = \u221a61 \u2248 7.81\n- (7, 5) - distance: \u221a((2-7)\u00b2 + (3-5)\u00b2) = \u221a(25+4) = \u221a29 \u2248 5.39\n\nPerfect! The apple at (2, 2) is directly below me at distance 1.0. I can grab it with just one move DOWN.\n\nLet me check for potential dangers:\n- Enemy snake is at (1, 2), which is to my left and slightly down\n- If I move DOWN to (2, 2), I'll be safe from collision since the enemy is at (1, 2)\n- The enemy snake might try to intercept me, but it would need to move RIGHT to (2, 2), and since we move simultaneously, I should get there first since I'm directly above it\n\nChecking all possible moves from (2, 3):\n- UP: (2, 4) - safe, but moves away from the closest apple\n- DOWN: (2, 2) - GETS THE APPLE! This is exactly what I want\n- LEFT: (1, 3) - safe, but the enemy snake at (1, 2) could move UP and we'd collide next turn\n- RIGHT: (3, 3) - safe, but moves away from target apple\n\nThis is a no-brainer - I should grab the apple at (2, 2) immediately.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting this apple and growing to length 1, reassess the board. The enemy snake will likely go for either the apple at (1, 0) or try to contest other apples. I should then consider going for the apple at (1, 7) or (7, 5) depending on where the enemy moves.\n\nDOWN"
