The opponent\u2019s nearest is (7,4), a bit farther.  \n\n**Safety check** \u2705  \n- **UP \u2192 (3,6)** \u2013 empty, no bodies, and the enemy can\u2019t crash into us there.  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,4)** \u2013 safe but moves us toward the opponent\u2019s lane.  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (2,5)** \u2013 safe, but we\u2019d still need another move to hit the apple.  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,5)** \u2013 safe, but pushes us toward the right edge where we might get boxed later.  \n\n**Strategic pick**  \nGoing **UP** puts us one move away from the prime apple at (2,6) while keeping plenty of escape routes (left, right, further up). It also stays out of the opponent\u2019s immediate path, avoiding a risky head\u2011on. Plus, we keep a good \u201cwiggle\u2011room\u201d zone for the next few turns.  \n\n**Long\u2011term game plan**  \n1. **Turn\u202f1:** Move UP to (3,6).  \n2. **Turn\u202f2:** Slide left to (2,6) and grab the apple \u2013 now we\u2019re +1 on the board and a little longer.  \n3. **After that:** Use our extra segment to start hemming the enemy in from the left\u2011bottom side, forcing them into tighter corridors.  \n\nLet\u2019s lock it in and start snatching that apple! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n**MOVE:**  \nUP",

No chance of a head\u2011on this turn.\n\n**Why LEFT is the sweet spot**\n\n- **Immediate reward:** Apple at (0,\u202f8) \u2192 +1 apple, widening the lead.  \n- **Strategic positioning:** Landing on the left wall gives us a tight \u201ctraffic tunnel\u201d down column\u202f0 where several more apples sit (0,\u202f3). We can sweep them while the opponent is stuck fighting for space in the centre/right.  \n- **Safety:** No collision risk with the opponent this turn, and we won\u2019t run into any body.  \n- **Future flexibility:** From (0,\u202f8) we\u2019ll have two solid continuations next turn \u2013\u202fdown the column or left\u2011hand side of the board (right into (1,\u202f8) is blocked, but downwards opens a long safe path).  \n\nGoing UP would keep a wider board but wastes the free apple right in front of us. Going DOWN limits us to a single narrow route without gaining points. So **LEFT** maximizes score and sets us up for a left\u2011side \u201cboxing\u201d strategy.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan (next few turns)**  \n1. **Turn\u202f6:** LEFT \u2192 (0,\u202f8) eat apple.  \n2. **Turn\u202f7\u201110:** descend the left column, gobbling (0,\u202f3) then (0,\u202f0)\u2011adjacent apples while the opponent battles around the middle.  \n3. Keep the opponent cramped between our tail on the left and the board edge on the right, forcing a head\u2011on when we have the apple advantage.\n\nLet\u2019s lock it in and grab that apple!  \n\nLEFT",
