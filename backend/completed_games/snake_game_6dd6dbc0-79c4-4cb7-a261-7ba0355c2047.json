I want to collect apples strategically.\n\nReasoning:\n- Moving LEFT will get me directly to the (1, 7) apple\n- This move seems safe with no immediate collision risks\n- Collecting apples will help me grow and score points\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting this apple, I'll look for the next closest apple and plot a path that minimizes risks.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
