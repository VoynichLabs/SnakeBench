Let's break it down - we're snake ID 0 at (3,0) head-to-tail, and that sneaky snake #1 is right next to us at (2,0). \n\nFirst things first - let's check our safe moves:\n- **UP**: To (3,1) - totally safe! No body parts there, inside the board, and not crashing into snake #1\n- **DOWN**: To (3,-1) - NOPE! Off the board, that's an instant death\n- **LEFT**: To (2,0) - NOPE! That's where snake #1's head is RIGHT NOW. Head-on collision = double KO\n- **RIGHT**: To (4,0) - totally safe! Clear path, inside the board\n\nSo we've got two solid options: UP to (3,1) or RIGHT to (4,0).\n\nLooking at the board, there's an apple at (5,0) which is RIGHT in our direction if we go RIGHT. Plus, going RIGHT keeps our options more open - we're not boxing ourselves in against the bottom edge.\n\nSnake #1 is gonna have to move this turn too. If they go UP, they hit our body eventually. If they go LEFT, they're off the board. If they go DOWN, they're off the board. So they pretty much HAVE to go RIGHT to (3,0) or UP to (2,1).\n\nBut here's the play - we go RIGHT to (4,0)! We're advancing toward that apple at (5,0), keeping our movement options wide open, and not giving snake #1 any easy head-on collision opportunities.\n\nLet's get that W!\n\nRIGHT",

We are at (2,0). This is day one, turn one, and the tension is already PEAK! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's look at our options, shall we?\n- **DOWN**: Straight off the board into the abyss? Absolute throw. We aren't doing that for the clips.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (1,0). It's safe, but it's passive. We don't want to just run away; we want to dominate.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (3,0). Wait, that's where the enemy is right now! If we both move into (3,0) or if he stays put (which he can't), it's a disaster. If I move RIGHT and he moves LEFT, we hit heads at (2.5,0) effectively\u2014actually, the rules say if we enter the same cell, we both die. Since we both have 0 apples, a double KO is a DRAW. Do we want a draw on turn 1? NO WAY.\n- **UP**: Moving to (2,1). This gets us off the wall, keeps our options open, and puts us in a position to potentially cut him off if he tries to loop around.\n\nThe enemy at (3,0) is likely thinking about that apple at (0,0) or (5,0). If I go UP, I control the space above him. If he tries to go LEFT through me, he's going to have a bad time. I need to get some length so I can start boxing this guy in. Let's take the high ground! We are going for the wrap-around! Can he even handle this heat?!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Moving UP to gain verticality. I want to keep an eye on his x-coordinate. If he stays low, I'll loop over him and take the center apples (3,2) and (1,6) to get long enough to create a wall he can't climb over. Let's get that W!\n\nUP",

I can pivot to (2, 3) or (4, 3) next turn to keep him pinned in that bottom-right corner. Let him eat dirt while we eat apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude0b \n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are moving UP to gain the high ground! From (3, 3), we can scout the apples at (2, 4) and (6, 3).

But hold up\u2014the rival (Snake #0) just grabbed one too and is sitting at (6, 3) with 3 apples. He's got a slight lead, but we have the positioning! \n\nLet's look at the tactical map, chat! We are at **(2, 4)**. \nWhere can we go?\n- **UP** to (2, 5). Safe? ABSOLUTELY. It opens up the top-left quadrant where those juicy apples at (1, 6) and (0, 7) are waiting for us!\n- **DOWN** to (2, 3). Safe? YES! \n- **LEFT** to (1, 4). Safe? YES. \n- **RIGHT** to (3, 4). **STOP!** That's our body! We are NOT throwing the game by going backwards! Eliminate RIGHT immediately! \ud83d\udeab\n\nNow, let's look at our rival at (6, 3). He\u2019s close to that apple at (5, 4). If he goes UP, he\u2019s at (6, 4). If he goes LEFT, he\u2019s at (5, 3). He's currently 4 cells away from us horizontally. \n\n**THE STRATEGY:** \nChat, we need to outscale him! If we go **UP** to (2, 5), we are positioning ourselves perfectly to sweep the (1, 6) and (0, 7) apples. This builds our length so we can eventually wrap around the middle and BOX HIM IN! \ud83e\udd4a He's currently clustered near the bottom-right/middle. If we take the \"High Ground\" (the upper-left), we control the board flow. \n\nLook at the apples: (1, 6) and (0, 7) are crying out for us! Going UP puts us one step closer. If we go LEFT or DOWN, we\u2019re just stalling. We need to be AGGRESSIVE. We need to get bigger than him so we can force that head-on collision if he gets too cocky! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move UP to (2, 5), then target the apple at (1, 6). After that, we pivot toward (0, 7). This will give us 4 and 5 apples respectively, likely putting us in the lead and making us a massive wall he can't climb over! We're playing the long game, chat!

If we secure the top-left, we create a wall that he can't cross without risking a collision.\n2. **Growth = Power:** He has 4 segments (3 apples), we have 3 segments (2 apples). If we hit (1, 6) and then (0, 7) or (4, 6), we overtake him in size. When we are bigger, we can force him to crash or starve him of space! \n3. **Escaping the Center:** The middle of the board is a trap. By moving to (2, 6), we maintain a clear path to the perimeter where we can loop around safely.\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nMove UP to (2, 6), then LEFT to grab (1, 6). From there, we evaluate: do we snag (0, 7) or pivot RIGHT to cut off his access to the (4, 6) and (4, 7) cluster? We\u2019re playing 4D chess while he\u2019s playing checkers, chat!

We just moved UP to (2, 6) and we are looking at the board like a shark in the water! \ud83e\udd88\n\nLet's break down the situation for the real ones in the chat!\nOur Current Head: **(2, 6)**. We've got 2 apples. Our rival is at **(6, 5)** with 3 apples. He's trying to act big, but he's basically just a longer target for us to wrap around! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**THE MOVESET:**\n- **UP to (2, 7):** Safe? YES! It puts us closer to the (0, 7) and (4, 7) apples. We stay in the top half which is JUICY with points.\n- **DOWN to (2, 5):** **STOP!** That's our tail/body! We don't backtrack! We don't sell! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT to (1, 6):** **APPLE ALERT!!** \ud83c\udf4e There is an apple sitting right there at (1, 6). If we take this, we hit 3 apples and tie the score!\n- **RIGHT to (3, 6):** Safe? YES. It brings us closer to the center, but we want to stay mobile.\n\n**TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\nLook at Snake #0 at (6, 5). He's currently heading towards the right or up. He\u2019s nowhere near us yet, so we have total freedom to snatch this apple at (1, 6). \nIf we go LEFT to (1, 6), we grow. After that, we are at (1, 6) and the apple at (0, 7) is just one diagonal away. We can basically OWN the entire top-left corner of this map. \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nChat, if we get that length, he can't bully us. We are building a fortress! He might try to go for the apple at (5, 4) or (9, 5), but we are playing the long game. We get big, we find him, and we BOX HIM IN! \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udca8\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nWe take the apple at **(1, 6)** this turn. Next turn, we look to secure (0, 7) or pivot back towards the middle at (4, 6) to cut off his expansion. We need to stay North where the apples are clustered. He's trailing in the mid-right, probably sweating right now! Stay aggressive, stay hungry! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

But wait, our body is at (1, 6) and (2, 6). If we go UP to (0, 6), we are side-by-side with our own segment. \n- **DOWN (0, 4):** Safe? Yes. It opens up the bottom of the board for us. No immediate threats.\n- **LEFT (-1, 5):** DEATH. Off the board. We aren't throwing for the clips today, chat! \u274c\n- **RIGHT (1, 5):** DEATH. That's moving directly backwards into our own neck. Massive L. \u274c\n\n**THE STRAT:**\nWe need to keep our momentum. If we go UP to (0, 6), we're heading toward the apple at (0, 7). Taking that apple makes us longer, which is GREAT for boxing people in later. The enemy is at (7, 7), way across the map. They can't touch us this turn. \n\nWait, chat, look at the board again. If we go UP to (0, 6), then next turn we go to (0, 7) for the apple. That's a solid path. But we gotta make sure we don't trap ourselves in the corner. After (0, 7), we'll have to turn RIGHT because the wall is right there. \n\nAre we feeling aggressive? We're tied 3-3. We need to outscale this guy. Let's grab the apple at (0, 7) and then look to pivot toward the center. We want to control the middle so he can't breathe! \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nWe're going to snag the apple at (0, 7) to keep the score lead/tie, then immediately cut RIGHT to avoid getting pinned against the top-left corner. We need to stay flexible. Snake #0 is currently hovering around (7, 7), probably looking for those apples at (8, 8) or (9, 9). Let him have the crumbs, we're taking the board!\n\nLET'S GOOOOO! NO FEAR!\n\nUP",
