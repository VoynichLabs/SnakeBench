However, I also need to be mindful of the enemy snake's position and make sure I'm not putting myself in a vulnerable spot.\n\nI think I'll try to move... RIGHT."

There are no other snakes or obstacles in my way, so this seems like a safe and straightforward move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After I get the apple at (0, 7), I'll reassess the board and look for the next closest apple. I might need to navigate around other snakes or obstacles, so I'll need to plan my next few moves carefully.\n\nNext move: UP."
