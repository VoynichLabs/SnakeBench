Keep an eye on the other snake\u2019s position if it changes to avoid head-to-head collisions.\n\n### Decision\nMove **LEFT** to start heading toward the apple at **(4, 8)**.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

No immediate threat.\n- There are no body segments, walls, or collisions directly threatening my current position.\n- The board is large, with plenty of space to maneuver safely.\n\n---\n\n### Goal and Apple Prioritization:\n1. The nearest apple is **(4, 8)**, just **two steps LEFT** from my current position **(6, 8)**.\n2. Once that apple is acquired, I can reassess targeting the next apple, likely **(2, 4)** (four steps LEFT-DOWN from **4, 8**).\n3. I should stay focused on moving horizontally LEFT toward **(4, 8)** as there's no urgent reason to deviate.\n\n---\n\n### Considering Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:\n   - Reduces my **X-coordinate**, bringing me closer to **(4, 8)**, the nearest apple.\n   - This is consistent with my goal to prioritize this apple.\n   - No threat or obstacle lies in this direction right now.\n\n2. **UP** or **DOWN**:\n   - Irrelevant here since the apple is horizontally aligned.\n   - Moving vertically wastes moves and creates inefficiency.\n\n3. **RIGHT**:\n   - Moves me away from my immediate goal (the nearest apple **(4, 8)**).\n   - No valid justification to move in this direction.\n\n---\n\n### Movement Decision:\n- Staying focused on heading toward **(4, 8)** is the logical choice. Since I am aligned on the Y-coordinate, I'll continue moving **LEFT** this turn to close the distance.\n- After capturing the apple at **(4, 8)**, I'll reevaluate the next target direction based on the closest and safest apple available.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n1. After eating **(4, 8)**, look for the next apple. The likely target will be **(2, 4)**.\n2. Avoid dead ends and monitor progression toward the center of the board for more flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Move:** LEFT"

My new body segment occupies **(5, 8)**, and my snake is now 2 segments in length.\n- The **next nearest apple** is at **(2, 4)**. However, other apples at **(7, 5)**, **(5, 6)**, **(6, 9)**, and **(1, 2)** are also in play and must be strategically prioritized.\n- **Enemy Snake**: Snake #0 is at **(2, 8)** with its body at **(1, 8)**. It remains far from me and from the apples I\u2019m targeting. For now, it does not pose an immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n#### Immediate Questions:\n1. **Which apple should I target next?**\n   - Among the remaining apples, **(2, 4)** is the closest, both in terms of distance (based on Manhattan distance) and ease of approach.\n     - **Current position** = (4, 8)\n     - **Distance to (2, 4)** = \\|4 - 2\\| + \\|8 - 4\\| = **6**\n   - Other apples have greater distances for now:\n     - **(7, 5)** = \\|4 - 7\\| + \\|8 - 5\\| = **6** (same distance but not as direct).\n     - **(5, 6)** = \\|4 - 5\\| + \\|8 - 6\\| = **3**! This apple is actually closer and more direct compared to **(2, 4)**. **Targeting (5, 6) is likely the better move.**\n   - **Decision**: Target **(5, 6)** as the next apple due to proximity and straight-line path.\n\n2. **What is my safest path to the selected apple?**\n   - From **(4, 8)**, to reach **(5, 6)**:\n     - I should **move DOWN** toward **(4, 7)**, then plan further movement toward **(5, 6)**.\n   - **Risks**:\n     - Enemy Snake #0 is still far (at **(2, 8)**) and not directly interfering with my path toward **(5, 6)**.\n     - My own body is at **(5, 8)**, so I must avoid doubling back onto it. Moving DOWN keeps the path open and ensures no self-collision.\n\n---\n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn:\n1. **Immediate Move**: Move **DOWN** to position **(4, 7)**, heading toward the apple at **(5, 6)**.\n2. Once I am closer to **(5, 6)**, reevaluate the board state and enemy snake positions to decide the safest approach.\n3. Monitor opportunities to pivot to other apples if the situation changes (e.g., if the enemy snake threatens my path or if new apples spawn elsewhere).\n4.

After my last move down, I successfully positioned myself closer to the apple at **(5, 6)**.\n- **Targeted Apple**: I\u2019m aiming for **(5, 6)** based on proximity and safety as calculated earlier. This apple remains the best target available because:\n  1. It\u2019s directly reachable with minimal moves.\n  2. No immediate interference exists from the enemy snake or any obstacles.\n- **Enemy Snake**: Snake #0 is at **(2, 7)** with its body at **[(2, 8)]**. The enemy remains distant and does not currently block my path to any apple.\n\n---\n\n#### Key Considerations:\n1. **Path to the Target Apple (5, 6)**:\n   - From my current position **(4, 7)**, the most direct path to **(5, 6)** is by moving **RIGHT** to **(5, 7)**, followed by moving **DOWN** to **(5, 6)**. \n   - This path avoids my body at **(4, 8)**, ensures I stay clear of the enemy snake, and brings me one step closer to the apple.\n\n2. **Collision Avoidance**:\n   - My own body consists of one segment at **(4, 8)**. This makes it crucial to avoid backtracking upwards.\n   - The board is large (10x10), so there is ample space to navigate around. There is no immediate threat of running into walls or boxing myself in.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake Activity**:\n   - Enemy Snake #0 seems to be moving leftward or staying along the **y = 7** axis. Its influence on my route to the apple at **(5, 6)** is negligible.\n\n4. **Future Decisions**:\n   - After eating the apple at **(5, 6)**, the next evaluation will depend on the nearest apple and Snake #0\u2019s new position.\n   - Current trajectory suggests possible follow-up targets at **(7, 5)** or **(6, 9)**, depending on new board dynamics.\n\n---\n\n#### Strategy:\n1. **Next Move**: Move **RIGHT** to position **(5, 7)**, one step closer to the apple at **(5, 6)**.\n2. **Monitor Changes**: Continuously assess Snake #0\u2019s movement and the possibility of new apple spawns.\n3. **Avoid Risky Patterns**: Avoid creating tight paths near my own body or walls.

I must cautiously plan future moves to avoid boxing myself in, especially when pursuing the apple at **(6, 9)** or **(4, 6)**.\n\n---\n\n### Future Planning:\n1. After collecting the apple at **(7, 5)**:\n   - My next target will likely be **(6, 9)** (positioned above me).

My snake has now grown by one unit, so my body will expand by one block during this turn.\n\n#### II. Remaining Apples:\n1. **(6, 9)**: This apple is **4 steps away (all UP)** and is directly above me. It is the closest apple and should be my next immediate target.\n2. **(4, 6)**: This apple is **to my left and 1 row above** me. It becomes more accessible after I grab the apple at **(6, 9)** and reposition.\n3. **(1, 2)** and **(1, 9)**: These apples are very far and currently not worth pursuing.\n\n#### III. Obstacles and Risks:\n1. **Self-Collision**:\n   - My body has expanded to **[(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)]**, with one more block to be added after this turn.\n   - I must avoid making movements that box me into a position where I cannot safely access open squares.\n\n2. **Walls/Map Limits**:\n   - The **board edge** is not an immediate concern for the next move. I am currently positioned away from all walls.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n   - **Snake #0**'s head is at **(1, 3)**, with its body at **[(1, 4), (2, 4)]**. It is at a safe distance and will not pose any interference in my current moves or upcoming apple pursuits.\n\n---\n\n### My Strategy:\n#### Immediate Move:\n- My next priority should be the apple at **(6, 9)**. It is 4 steps upward (**UP, UP, UP, UP**) from my current position.\n- Moving **UP** toward this apple is safe and does not put me at risk of a collision with myself or other obstacles.\n\n#### Mid-Term Considerations:\n1. Once I grab the apple at **(6, 9)**, I will need to carefully evaluate whether to target **(4, 6)** or the more distant apples at **(1, 2)** and **(1, 9)**.\n2. I must plan my movements carefully to avoid crowding myself near the top of the board.\n\n#### Safety Check for This Turn:\n- Moving **UP** is completely safe. My snake's body parts (including the growing tail) will remain clear of the space I move into.\n- There are no immediate threats from other snakes or walls.\n\n---\n\n### Decided Next Move:\n**UP**"

It is my nearest and most logical target, as no obstacles block me from reaching it.\n- **(4, 6)**: This apple is **to my left, 3 squares away**. I could target it after capturing the apple at (6, 9).\n- **(1, 9)**: Far away at the top left. Not a priority for now.\n- **(2, 0)**: At the bottom left, also very far and not practical at the moment.\n- **(3, 1)**: This apple is even farther than the others and not worth considering at this time.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Obstacles and Risks:\n#### a) My Own Snake:\n- Moving **UP** next will not lead to a collision with my own body, as my head is moving away from my tail and my body is mostly below me.\n- Moving **LEFT** or **DOWN** right now would risk colliding with my snake\u2019s body. These moves should not even be considered.\n\n#### b) Walls and Board Limits:\n- The top wall is **3 spaces above** my current position, so I still have room to move upward safely.\n\n#### c) Enemy Snakes:\n- **Snake #0\u2019s head is at (1, 2)**, far away from my position. It poses no immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n### 4) My Strategy:\n#### Immediate Priority:\n- The apple at **(6, 9)** is my next goal. All I need to do is move **UP** three times in a row to reach it. Because it\u2019s so close, I\u2019ll reach this apple quickly and grow further, which puts me in a stronger position in the game.\n\n#### Mid-Term Strategy:\n- After capturing **(6, 9)**, I will evaluate the board again. The next apple I target depends on the state of the game. Likely, **(4, 6)** will become my next target since it is nearby and accessible.\n- I will need to continue avoiding self-collisions as my snake grows larger. Carefully planning each move to leave sufficient space for maneuvering will remain critical.\n\n---\n\n### Safety Check:\n- Moving **UP** this turn is completely safe. No snakes, walls, or other obstacles will interfere with this move.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy to Tell Myself Next Turn:\n- I will likely continue moving **UP** next turn as well to stay aligned with going after the **(6, 9)** apple. After eating it, I\u2019ll evaluate whether to target nearby apples or reposition strategically.\n\n---\n\n### Decided Next Move:\n**UP**"

It\u2019s not a priority right now.\n- **(2, 0)** and **(3, 1)**: Both are located at the bottom-left part of the board. They are very far and should not even be considered until the board state changes.\n\n---\n\n#### 3) Obstacles and Risks:\n\n##### a) My Own Snake:\n- Moving **UP** this turn will NOT lead to a collision with my own body. Since my body is trailing behind and below me, there is plenty of space to maneuver upward toward the **(6, 9)** apple.\n- Moving **DOWN** or **LEFT** right now would result in an immediate self-collision. These moves are not safe or logical.\n- Moving **RIGHT** is safe, but it leads me farther away from my target apple and doesn\u2019t contribute to my goal.\n\n##### b) Walls and Board Limits:\n- The top wall is **2 squares above** my current position at **(9, 7)**. I am completely safe to continue moving **UP** without hitting the board edges.\n\n##### c) Enemy Snakes:\n- **Snake #0** is located in the bottom-left quadrant of the board near **(1, 1)**. Its head and body are far away from both me and any apples I care about. It poses no immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n#### 4) Strategy for This Turn:\n- My nearest and safest target remains the **(6, 9)** apple. From my current position, it is exactly **2 moves UP**. There are no obstacles between me and this apple, and no risks that could interfere with reaching it.\n- Strategy is straightforward: **Continue moving UP until I capture the (6, 9) apple.**\n\n---\n\n#### 5) Mid-Term Strategy (After Capturing (6, 9)):\n- After growing and eating the **(6, 9)** apple, I will reanalyze the board. My next likely target will be the **(4, 6)** apple, as it will then be the closest and most accessible option.\n- My goal will remain to grow while maintaining sufficient safe maneuvering space. I will be cautious not to trap myself or make risky moves, ensuring I always leave room to turn and reposition.\n\n---\n\n#### Safety Check:\n- Moving **UP** this turn is 100% safe. No walls, no collision risks, and no interference from enemy snakes. This move keeps me aligned with my strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy to Tell Myself Next Turn:\n- Unless the board state changes (e.g., a new apple spawns closer, or there\u2019s some unexpected risk), I will move **UP** again next turn to secure the **(6, 9)** apple.\n\n---\n\n### Decided Next Move:\n**UP**"

From my current location at **(7, 8)**, I can reach it in **1 move LEFT**.\n- **(4, 6)**: This apple will likely become my next target after capturing **(6, 9)**.

My own body is trailing behind and to my current south at coordinates **[(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)]**, leaving plenty of room to maneuver.\n- Moving **RIGHT** would not lead to a self-collision, but it takes me farther away from the current target apple (**6, 9**) and serves no purpose.\n- Moving **UP** or **DOWN** this turn does not make sense because either direction leads me farther from the target (**6, 9**) or risks potential inefficiency.\n\n##### b) Walls and Board Edges:\n- The nearest wall is to the north at **(7, 9)**. I\u2019m nearly at the top edge of the board, but moving **LEFT** towards the **(6, 9)** apple does not bring me into contact with any walls.

Neither its position nor its movements threaten me in any way currently. There are no enemy snakes nearby.\n\n---\n\n#### 4) Strategy for This Turn:\n- The **(6, 9)** apple is directly to the LEFT of my snake at **(6, 8)**. Capturing it will expand my snake's total size and increase my points by 1. \n- The move is straightforward and completely safe: **Move LEFT onto the (6, 9) apple**, claiming the apple and growing my snake.\n\n---\n\n#### 5) Mid-Term Strategy (After Capturing (6, 9)):\n- After capturing **(6, 9)**, I will reanalyze the board, identifying the next closest and most achievable apple.\n- The **(4, 6)** apple will likely become my top priority.

This is now my **primary target** because it is accessible, and moving toward this direction will keep me in safe territory.\n2. **(1, 9)**: Farther away from my current position and in a risky zone because it\u2019s near the top-left corner and beyond the enemy snake's main body.\n3. **(2, 0)** and **(9, 2)**: Both of these apples remain too far to consider right now, especially since they are at opposite corners of the board. Navigating to either of them would waste time and could create unnecessary risks.\n\n#### 3) **Obstacles and Risks**:\n\n##### a) My Own Snake:\n- My snake's growing body has trailed behind toward **(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), and (7, 6)**. Any path toward the **(4, 6)** apple must steer clear of passing back over the snake's current trail.\n- The bottom-left portion of the board remains mostly free, so moving diagonally toward **(4, 6)** shouldn't create conflicts with my own body.\n\n##### b) Walls and Board Edges:\n- Moving **DOWN and LEFT** carefully keeps me away from walls. As long as I track my snake's body, I will avoid getting trapped near the bottom or side walls.\n- I must maintain open space around my movements in preparation for my snake\u2019s growth.\n\n##### c) Enemy Snakes:\n- **Snake #0**, with its head at **(3, 0)**, remains far from threatening me directly. However, it could move unpredictably in future turns as it tries to pursue its own apples.\n- I should still avoid the bottom-left corner near **(2, 0)** because Snake #0 has some body segments nearby. Keeping a safe distance for now is the best option.\n\n---\n\n#### 4) **Strategy for this Turn**:\n- Begin moving toward the apple at **(4, 6)**. This direction aligns well with safety, reducing risks of running into walls, myself, or other snakes.\n- Breaking the movement plan into steps:\n  - From **(6, 9)**, moving **DOWN** will position me at **(6, 8)**, closer to the **(4, 6)** apple diagonally.\n  - Future moves will involve heading either LEFT or DOWN to continue closing the gap to the target apple.\n\n#### 5) **Mid-Term Strategy**:\n1. Focus on obtaining **(4, 6)** safely as the next apple.\n2. As I approach **(4, 6)**, ensure I\u2019ve cleared my own growing body trail to keep maneuvering space open.\n3. Continue observing the board state for any newly spawned apples or movements by Snake #0.\n\n---\n\n### Safety Check:\n- **Is DOWN Safe?** Yes:\n  - No walls, my own body, or enemies block my path along **(6, 8)**.\n  - This move safely begins my approach to the **(4, 6)** apple.\n\n---\n\n### Decided Next Move: **DOWN**\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for Myself Next Turn:\n- Assess board state again after moving **DOWN (6, 8)**. Depending on the position of the enemy snake and the state of my snake\u2019s body, determine whether to move LEFT or keep heading downward. Anticipate safe passage to the **(4, 6)** apple."
