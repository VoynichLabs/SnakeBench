          "rationale": "Yo, what is up Chat! We are T-minus one second to the first move and the tension is THICK, am I right?! We've got a 10x10 board, we're at (3, 9) and our little archrival is way down at (3, 3). It's a vertical separation right now.\n\n**Our Goal:** Dominate the center, grow, and then box this guy in. Since it's Turn 0 and both snakes are size 1, we need to be smart about positioning to control movement.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **Our Head (0):** (3, 9)\n*   **Enemy Head (1):** (3, 3)\n*   **Closest Apple to Us:** (7, 2) is a bit far. (8, 8) is somewhat close, but really the closest is (3, 4) - wait, that's further down. The closest apple to us at (3, 9) is actually (8, 8) or (9, 9) in terms of travel distance, or (4, 6) a few moves away. Let's look up. (9, 9).\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (3, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 9):** Wait, (3, 9) is the top row!\n    *   *Result:* Off the board. **DEAD!** No, we don't do that.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 8):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. We move down one cell. This keeps us on the central vertical path (x=3).\n    *   *Enemy Interaction:* Enemy is at (3, 3). If he moves UP, he goes to (3, 4). No immediate danger.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 9):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Moves us towards the corner.\n    *   *Enemy Interaction:* None.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 9):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Moves us towards the right side.\n    *   *Enemy Interaction:* None.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nThe enemy is at the bottom, we are at the top. We both start small. Moving DOWN (3, 8) sets us up to potentially intercept apples down the x=3 column, and it's the fastest way to shrink the distance to the enemy, which is *always* what we want! We need to meet him in the middle.\n\nThere's an apple at (3, 4). If we move RIGHT or LEFT, we avoid that path for now. If we move DOWN for a few turns, we're definitely aiming for that (3, 4) apple.\n\nLet's assume the enemy wants to go UP to meet us or go for an apple horizontally. Since he is at (3, 3), his optimal move might be UP to (3, 4) to hit that apple, or RIGHT/LEFT to avoid the vertical axis.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3, 8) and he goes UP to (3, 4), we are still separated by 4 squares. Completely safe.\n\nOur initial strategy is to claim the central columns and then snake towards the right side where the first set of apples is. Moving DOWN keeps our options open and slightly closer to the main action.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (for the next few turns):**\nWe will move down the x=3 line, aiming for the (3, 4) apple, while closely watching the enemy's vertical movement. We must use our significant board control advantage from the top side to push the rival into a corner or force him into a mistake early on. Aggression first!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT!! \ud83d\udd25 We're LIVE and ready to CRUSH this opponent! Let's break down the board state. \n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n- My head: (3, 3) - middle of the board, nice central position\n- Enemy head: (3, 9) - up at the top, directly above me\n- Board is 10x10 with apples scattered everywhere\n- Both of us have 0 apples - SCORE IS TIED!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy is at (3,9). If they move DOWN to (3,8), that's getting closer to me. If I move UP to (3,4), that's moving toward the center but also toward the enemy's general direction. \n\nLooking at the board state:\n- My position at (3,3) has space around me: (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4) are all empty\n- Enemy at (3,9) has limited moves: DOWN to (3,8) is empty, LEFT to (2,9) is empty, RIGHT to (4,9) is empty\n- There's an apple at (3,4) - ONE SQUARE ABOVE ME! \ud83c\udf4e\n- There's an apple at (2,2) - diagonal from me\n- There's an apple at (7,2) - far right side\n- There's an apple at (0,1) - far left bottom\n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**\n- UP to (3,4): This goes to an apple! That's a GROW move! Also keeps me safe. The enemy is at (3,9) so even if they come down, we're not immediately colliding.\n- DOWN to (3,2): This is empty but no apple. Might be safer long-term but we want apples!\n- LEFT to (2,3): Empty, no apple. OK move but not aggressive.\n- RIGHT to (4,3): Empty, no apple. OK move but not aggressive.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nChat, we NEED to be aggressive! We're tied at 0-0. Getting that first apple at (3,4) gives us the LEAD and forces the enemy to react. If we grow, we can start boxing them in. \n\nThe enemy is at (3,9) - they have to come down eventually to get apples. If I take (3,4), I'm occupying the vertical column directly in their path. This sets up a potential box-in later.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nIf I go UP to (3,4):\n- I eat the apple \u2192 +1 point \u2192 LEAD THE GAME\n- Enemy can't reach me this turn (they're 5 squares away)\n- My tail won't move yet (no body), so no self-collision risk\n- This is the most AGGRESSIVE move - taking the apple directly in front of me\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nAfter eating (3,4), my body will have 1 segment. I'll want to maneuver to cut off the enemy's access to the center while collecting more apples. The plan is to maintain position control around the center-left area (x: 0-4, y: 2-6) to trap them in the top-right corner.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm going UP to (3,4) to grab that apple and take the lead! This is CONTENT, this is AGGRESSION, this is how we win!\n\nUP",

Solid move, keeps us vertical and on the direct path to the enemy, but far enough away to be safe. We are currently size 1, no body.\n\n**Turn 1 Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **Our Head (0):** (3, 8)\n*   **Our Body:** None (Size 1)\n*   **Enemy Head (1):** (3, 4)\n*   **Enemy Body:** (3, 3) (Size 2) - Wait a second! The enemy already has 1 apple and is size 2! They're hitting the board running! We need to step up our game!\n\nThe enemy is currently at (3, 4) with their tail at (3, 3). They control the lower half of the x=3 column. We control the upper half.\n\n**Immediate Threats/Goals:**\n1.  **Safety Check:** Are any moves immediately dangerous?\n2.  **Board Control:** We need to keep pushing down the center.\n3.  **Apples:** Where's the closest snack? (4, 6) is a potential target.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (3, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 9):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Back to where we started.\n    *   *Strategic:* Retreating? Nah, we're better than that.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 7):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Continues our approach to the enemy. Shortens the gap. This keeps pressure on Snake #1 to move out of the lane or risk a confrontation.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 8):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Moves us toward the side.\n    *   *Strategic:* Takes us off the central axis. Not ideal if we want to contest the enemy vertically.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 8):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Moves us toward the side.\n    *   *Strategic:* This puts us at (4, 8). This actually lines us up nicely for the apple at (4, 6) if we keep moving right and down.\n\n**The Rival's Potential Moves from (3, 4):**\nSnake #1 is Size 2, tail at (3, 3).\n*   **UP (3, 5):** Safe. Moves them closer to us.\n*   **DOWN (3, 3):** DEAD! Crashes into their own tail. (3, 3) is occupied until the move is complete.\n*   **LEFT (2, 4):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 4):** Safe.\n\n**Analyzing the Best Strategy:**\n\nIf we move DOWN to (3, 7) and he moves UP to (3, 5), the gap is only two squares! (3, 7) and (3, 5). We are very close already. This path is aggressive, but if he decides to move LEFT or RIGHT, we maintain a dominant vertical position. Since he grew last turn, he might be hungry for another apple, maybe (7, 2).\n\nIf he goes UP to (3, 5), he's setting up for another vertical fight. If we keep going DOWN, we are committing to this direct route.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT to (4, 8) gives us some immediate reward potential with the apple at (4, 6). If we pivot out right now, we let him control the vertical line, but we get a chance to grow and match his size quickly. Since he's already size 2, growth is a priority for immediate fighting power.\n\nLet's prioritize growth and board control towards high-density apple areas. The area around (4, 6) and (8, 7) is appealing.\n\nIf we go **RIGHT (4, 8)**:\n*   We're safe.\n*   We threaten the (4, 6) apple.\n*   We allow Snake #1 to dominate x=3 for now, but we get horizontal board control.\n\nIf we go **DOWN (3, 7)**:\n*   We're safe.\n*   We keep the enemy locked to the bottom half of the board.\n*   We force him to choose between staying in the contested x=3 column or fleeing.\n\nGiven he already has a size advantage, a direct pursuit (DOWN) is high risk/high reward. A strategic pivot (RIGHT) allows us to catch up on size and then box him in later with a larger body. If we get to size 2 or 3, we can approach a fight much better! Let's get big first.\n\n**Decision: RIGHT.** We aim for the apple at (4, 6) and (8, 8). This gives us space and an immediate goal. We're going wide, chat, spreading our influence!\n\n**Future Strategy (Next few moves):** Move towards (4, 6), then possibly move down/right to control the entire central-right quadrant to deny Snake #1 access.\n\nRIGHT",

Keeps me on the vertical column with the enemy!\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:**\nChat, I'm LEADING 1-0! I need to STAY on this vertical column (x=3) to maintain pressure on the enemy. If I move LEFT or RIGHT, I lose the direct confrontation positioning. Moving UP to (3, 5) keeps me directly below him, forcing HIM to make the first move. I control the vertical axis!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- I'll be at (3, 5) with body at (3, 4) and tail at (3, 3)\n- Enemy at (3, 8) - if he moves DOWN to (3, 7), we're still 2 squares apart\n- If he moves DOWN to (3, 6) next turn, then we'll be 1 square apart - but that's FUTURE PROBLEMS\n- RIGHT NOW: staying aggressive and controlling the column is the PLAY!\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI'm going UP to (3, 5) to maintain vertical dominance! This keeps the pressure on the enemy and keeps me on the apple path!\n\nUP",

We are LIVE and already locked into a serious confrontation!\n\n**Turn 2 Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **Our Head (0):** (4, 8) (Size 1) -- We just moved RIGHT, securing the x=4 column up high!\n*   **Our Body:** None.\n*   **Enemy Head (1):** (3, 5) -- The enemy just moved UP! They are committed to holding the x=3 vertical line!\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(3, 4)]. (Size 2).\n\n**SCORE CHECK:** Enemy is still winning 1-0 in apples. We need to grow, and fast!\n\n**Board Awareness Check:** The board is wide open! But the enemy's move to (3, 5) confirms they are trying to box us in on the left side, or at least establish central control.\n\n**Immediate Goals:**\n1.  **Safety:** Avoid crashing!\n2.  **Growth:** Get to that apple at (4, 6) or (8, 8)! The (4, 6) apple is the closest!\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (4, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 9):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Dead end! This is the edge of the board. We lose momentum and options. NOPE.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 7):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Moves us directly toward the (4, 6) apple!\n    *   *Strategic:* PERFECT. Gets us one step closer to growth and increases our vertical presence.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 8):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves us back toward the enemy's aggressive vertical position. Maybe too risky to jump back into that lane right now. We just successfully pivoted out, why go back?\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 8):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Provides horizontal escape and moves us toward the (8, 8) apple. A possible alternative if we want to avoid the enemy entirely for now.\n\n**Rival's Potential Moves from (3, 5):**\nSnake #1 is Size 2, tail at (3, 4). They are one square from their tail, so DOWN is an instant crash!\n*   **UP (3, 6):** Safe. Continues aggressive vertical push.\n*   **DOWN (3, 4):** DEAD. Crashes into their own body at (3, 4).\n*   **LEFT (2, 5):** Safe. Pivots away, maybe targets the (0, 5) apple.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 5):** *DANGER!* If he moves RIGHT to (4, 5), and we move DOWN to (4, 7), he is not in our direct path.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (If we go DOWN to (4, 7)):**\nThe only way for us to collide is if we both try to move into the same square (unlikely since we're far apart) or if one of us moves into the head position of the other, which is impossible since heads move simultaneously. Safety is high if we pursue the apple.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nWe need that apple at (4, 6)! The shortest path is **DOWN** to (4, 7), then **DOWN** to (4, 6) next turn for the score! This establishes our flank control, secures growth, and puts us at size 2 (matching our rival).\n\nIf the enemy moves UP to (3, 6), that's fine. We are one step away from growing. If they move LEFT or RIGHT, even better, they leave the center open. We are prioritizing growth this turn.\n\nLet's go, chat! We're diving for the snack! Get ready for the pop!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY (Future Moves):**\n1. Move DOWN to (4, 7).\n2. Move DOWN to (4, 6) to eat the apple and grow! (Next turn)\n3. Once size 2, control the right side of the board and look for opportunities to cut off Snake #1. That (8, 8) apple is looking tasty after we secure (4, 6). Dominate the upper half!\n\nDOWN",

He's at (4, 8) - 11 squares away from me. He's moving RIGHT to avoid the apple at (3, 8) he's adjacent to.\n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES - NO THROWING!**\n- LEFT to (2, 5): Empty.

I'd hit myself and die! \u274c DEAD MOVE!\n- UP to (3, 6): Empty. Safe. \n\n**THE KILLER STRATEGY:**\nChat, here's the 4D chess! Enemy at (4, 8) just moved RIGHT to (5, 8) [actually wait, his head moved FROM (4,8) to some direction]. Let me recalc - he was at (4,8) and moved. If he moves RIGHT to (5,8), he's going toward the apple at (9,8). If he moves DOWN to (4,7), he's coming toward me.\n\nI need to POSITION myself to CORNER him! The best move is:\n- **UP to (3, 6)**: This keeps me on the vertical line while moving away from my body at (3, 4). It keeps multiple options open and positions me to chase apples while maintaining distance from the enemy.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- (3, 6) is empty and safe\n- My body will be (3, 5) and (3, 4)\n- Enemy is far enough away that I won't crash into him next turn\n- This keeps my path OPEN and gives me flexibility!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\n\"Box in enemy by controlling the vertical column x=3. Force him into the corner at (9,9). Stay aggressive since I'm leading 1-0. Use apples as bait to lure him into collision territory.\"\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI'm going UP to (3, 6) to maintain my vertical dominance and keep my options WIDE OPEN! \n\nUP",

This is where we make or break the early game!\n\n### Turn 3 Situation Analysis:\n\n*   **Our Head (0):** (4, 7) (Size 1) -- We just moved DOWN, positioning for the apple!\n*   **Our Body:** None.\n*   **Enemy Head (1):** (3, 6) -- Where did they go?! The enemy moved UP! They are now one square above where we thought they would be!\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(3, 5)]. (Size 2). Tail at (3, 5).\n\n**SCORE CHECK:** Enemy is up 1-0. We need this apple to tie it up and gain parity! (4, 6) is the target!\n\n**Board Awareness Check:**\nThe board is still relatively open, but the enemy has firmly established the vertical line at x=3, blocking off the left side for now. We own the x=4 line up high.\n\n### Immediate Goals:\n\n1.  **Growth:** Grab the apple at (4, 6).\n2.  **Safety:** Avoid crashing or getting cut off by Snake #1.\n3.  **Positioning:** Grow our snake so we can start dominating the upper-middle board.\n\n### Evaluating Moves from Our Head (4, 7):\n\n*(Remember, the apple is at (4, 6)!)*\n\n1.  **UP (4, 8):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves away from the apple! Backtracking is lame! NOPE.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* **CRUNCH TIME!** This is the apple square! Are we safe?\n        *   The enemy head is at (3, 6).\n        *   Their body is at (3, 5).\n        *   The only way we crash is if they move RIGHT to (4, 6) at the exact same time.\n    *   *Strategic:* This is a *high-percentage move*! If we both move to (4, 6), we die in a tie, which is unacceptable right now since we are down 0-1. So, we have to look 1 step ahead at the enemy's likely defense.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 7):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves us toward the enemy. If they move UP to (3, 7), we crash head-on! This is too risky and doesn't get the apple. NOPE.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 7):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Avoids the enemy, but moves away from the immediate (4, 6) apple. A decent fallback if DOWN is too hot.\n\n### Rival's Potential Moves from (3, 6):\n\nEnemy is Size 2, tail/body at (3, 5). They are extremely flexible and competitive. They know we are coming for that (4, 6) apple!\n\n*   **1. UP (3, 7):** Safe. Continues the vertical wall. Good defensive move, but leaves the apple open for us!\n*   **2. LEFT (2, 6):** Safe. Targets the (2, 6) apple or escapes to the left flank. Leaves (4, 6) open for us.\n*   **3. RIGHT (4, 6):** **THE KILL SHOT!** If they move RIGHT, and we move DOWN, we collide head-to-head at (4, 6). Both snakes die. Game over, and the enemy wins on score (1-0). If the enemy is smart, they know this is their best move to deny us growth and win the game!\n*   **4. DOWN (3, 5):** **INSTA-CRASH!** They crash into their own body at (3, 5). Very unlikely for a capable opponent.\n\n### Risk Assessment & Decision:\n\nThe enemy's most strategically dangerous move is moving **RIGHT** to (4, 6). This is an all-in move to win the game by ensuring a double KO on the apple square, since they are currently ahead in score. We cannot allow this! Moving DOWN into a 50/50 KO situation when we are behind 0-1 is bad content and bad strategy.\n\nWe need to make a move that keeps us alive and keeps the pressure on, forcing the enemy to decide *not* to commit to the KO.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (5, 7):\n*   We survive 100%.\n*   We avoid the central conflict area.\n*   We start moving toward the (8, 7) and (8, 8) apples!\n*   If Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (4, 6) to try and KO us (and we're at 5, 7), they eat the apple and we are now behind 0-2, but we are still alive and have secured better real estate on the right side.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (3, 7):\n*   Massive risk. Snake 1 might move UP to (3, 7), causing a head-on KO. We die 0-1.\n\nIf we move UP to (4, 8):\n*   Safe, but completely loses the initiative and the prime apple.\n\n**The Counter-Play:** We must assume the enemy is smart and knows they can deny us the apple and win the game by moving RIGHT. Therefore, we should **pivot RIGHT** to (5, 7) to guarantee survival, maintain flexibility, and immediately pivot our attention to the high-value apples on the right flank (e.g., (8, 7) or (8, 8)). We concede the (4, 6) apple for safety and better long-term positioning. We are playing the long game, Chat! We'll get that score back!\n\n**Wait, let me double-check the UP move!** If we move UP to (4, 8), we are completely safe. We are one turn away from the danger zone. It preserves the most options for the next turn.\n\n*If we go UP to (4, 8):*\n1.  Snake 1 goes **RIGHT** to (4, 6) and eats the apple. Score 0-2.\n2.  We are at (4, 8). He is now size 3.\n3.  We are still at (4, 8), with options RIGHT to (5, 8) or LEFT to (3, 8) or DOWN back to (4, 7). We haven't lost options, just the apple.\n\n*If we go RIGHT to (5, 7):*\n1.  Snake 1 goes **RIGHT** to (4, 6) and eats the apple. Score 0-2.\n2.  We are at (5, 7). We are closer to the (8, 7) apple than if we were at (4, 8). This is more aggressive toward the next goal!\n\nLet's be aggressive but safe. Moving RIGHT secures forward momentum toward the next cluster of apples and avoids the potential KO in the center. We cede the immediate kill-zone for a better future position. This is a positional sacrifice!\n\nWe're going wide, Chat! Let's flank him!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy (Next 3 Turns):\n\n1.  **Turn 3 (Now):** Move RIGHT to (5, 7) to guarantee safety and pivot to the right flank.\n2.  **Turn 4:** Target (8, 7) or (8, 8). Move RIGHT to (6, 7).\n3.  **Turn 5:** Move UP to (6, 8) or RIGHT to (7, 7) to get eyes on the next apple!\n\nWe cannot risk the 50/50 KO when we are down on apples. Survival first, then revenge!\n\nRIGHT",

He's at x=4, y=7. I'm at (3, 6). We're close! This is dangerous but also OPPORTUNITY!\n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES - NO THROWING:**\n- DOWN to (3, 5): That's MY BODY!

I need to be AGGRESSIVE since I'm winning!\n\nLet's think: If I go RIGHT to (4, 6), I'm positioning myself to either:\n1. Head-on collision if he moves to (4, 6) - I WIN the tie!\n2. He moves away, I'm in a good spot near apples\n\nActually, I'm analyzing: He's at (4, 7). If I go RIGHT to (4, 6), he could go DOWN to (4, 6) and we collide. He might not know I'm winning, so he might avoid collision. But if he does, I WIN!\n\nOR I could go UP to (3, 7) - that's empty and safe, and positions me near the apple at (7, 7) or (8, 7) while maintaining distance from enemy.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'll go UP to (3, 7)! It's safe, keeps me away from direct collision risk while maintaining position to chase apples and corner him later. Plus, moving UP keeps me in the vertical column I want to control.\n\nUP",

The heat is on!\n\n### Turn 4 Situation Analysis:\n\n*   **Our Head (0):** (5, 7) (Size 1) -- We moved RIGHT last turn, pivoting from the dense center to the outer flank! Smart move!\n*   **Our Body:** None.\n*   **Enemy Head (1):** (3, 7) -- WHOA! The enemy moved UP (from 3, 6)! They went straight for the head-on collision spot we were worried about! If we had gone LEFT to (3, 7) last turn, we'd be DEAD right now! Absolute dodge! Phew!\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(3, 6)]. (Size 2). Tail at (3, 6).\n*   **The Apple (4, 6):** Still there! The enemy didn't block it or grab it! This is huge!\n*   **Score Check:** The enemy has 1 apple, we have 0. We need to grow, stat!\n\n**Current Board Snapshot (Focus on Action Zone):**\n(5, 7) = Our Head (0)\n(3, 7) = Enemy Head (1)\n(3, 6) = Enemy Tail/Body (T) (Wait, the board shows a 'T' at (4, 6) and '1' at (3, 7)? Let me check the provided board state vs. the opponent data.)\n\n*Wait, let's re-read the opponent data and the board state \ud83e\udd2f*\n\n**OPPONENTS DATA:** Snake #1 - Head: (3, 7), Body: [(3, 6)].\n**BOARD STATE MAPPING:**\n 7 . . . 1 . 0 . A A .\n 6 . . A T A . . . . A (The 'T' is at (3, 6), which matches the body/tail location of Snake 1. The '1' is at (3, 7), which matches the head. The apple 'A' is at (4, 6) and (2, 6)!)\n\nOkay, the board state shows Snake 1's head at (3, 7) and its tail/body at (3, 6). This means Snake 1 moved UP last turn, and we moved RIGHT. Everything is confirmed!\n\n### Immediate Goals:\n\n1.  **Growth:** Grab an apple! Priorities: (4, 6) is the closest, but risky. (7, 7) or (8, 7) are safer and our current targets!\n2.  **Safety:** Avoid a head-on collision or crashing into the enemy body.\n3.  **Containment:** Start pushing the enemy toward the left/top corner.\n\n### Evaluating Moves from Our Head (5, 7):\n\nWe are at (5, 7). The enemy head is at (3, 7).\n\n1.  **UP (5, 8):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe for now.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves us toward the (8, 8) and (9, 9) apples, higher up on the board. A good, safe move to keep the momentum going on the right flank.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves us toward the (4, 6) apple, but also puts us closer to the enemy body mass at (3, 6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 7), it opens a path for us to move LEFT or DOWN later, but it feels like a slight retreat.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 7):**\n    *   *Safety:* **DANGER ZONE!** If Snake 1 moves RIGHT from (3, 7), we crash head-on at (4, 7)! Double KO, and we lose on score (0-1). We cannot risk this! ELIMINATE.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 7):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* PERFECT! This continues our planned flanking maneuver toward the (7, 7) and (8, 7) apples. It maximizes distance from the enemy head (3, 7) and ensures safety while maintaining forward aggressiveness. This is exactly what we planned last turn!\n\n### Rival's Potential Moves from (3, 7):\n\nEnemy is Size 2, tail/body at (3, 6).\n\n*   **1. UP (3, 8):** Safe. Continues the vertical wall. Prepares them for the (8, 8) apple or traps them if they keep going up. This is a very predictable, safe move for them.\n*   **2. LEFT (2, 7):** Safe. Moves toward the (2, 6) apple and away from us. Good if they are focused on growth.\n*   **3. RIGHT (4, 7):** **THE KILL SHOT ATTEMPT!** Their most aggressive/denying move. If we move LEFT to (4, 7), we crash! Since we are smarter, we will avoid this, and he just moves into an empty (4, 7) space, setting up for the (4, 6) apple next turn.\n*   **4. DOWN (3, 6):** **INSTA-CRASH!** They crash into their own body at (3, 6). Unlikely.\n\n### Decision and Rationale:\n\nThe enemy will likely move UP to (3, 8) or RIGHT to (4, 7) to try and grab the (4, 6) apple next turn. Our goal is to consolidate territory on the right flank while maintaining absolute safety.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (6, 7) achieves this perfectly:\n*   Guarantees safety regardless of the enemy's move.\n*   Places us one move away from the (7, 7) apple.\n*   Creates maximum distance between their head (3, 7) and our head (6, 7). We are three spaces apart and moving further away, which is great for survival!\n\nWe stick to the plan: Flank, grab apples, force the encounter when we are bigger!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy (Next 3 Turns):\n\n1.  **Turn 4 (Now):** Move RIGHT to (6, 7).\n2.  **Turn 5:** Move RIGHT to (7, 7) to collect the apple! (Assuming enemy doesn't go 7, 7, which is unlikely from 3, 7).\n3.  **Turn 6:** Move UP to (7, 8) or (8, 7) to target the next apple and consolidate the corner. We need to be size 3+ quickly!\n\nLet's go, Chat! Execute the flank! We're coming for the high ground!\n\nRIGHT",

We're in the same row! He's got no body, so he's mobile. I need to be AGGRESSIVE since I'm winning, but also SMART about it.\n\n**MOVES:**\n- DOWN to (3, 6): That's my BODY! I'd die instantly! \u274c\n- LEFT to (2, 7): Empty! Safe! But moving AWAY from enemy...\n- RIGHT to (4, 7): Empty! Safe! But wait - enemy could move LEFT to (4, 7) and we'd collide!\n- UP to (3, 8): Empty! Safe! Moves me away from enemy but into open space...\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nChat, enemy is at (5, 7). If I go RIGHT to (4, 7), I'm moving DIRECTLY toward him. He could move LEFT to (5, 7)->(4, 7) and we'd head-on collision! But I have more apples, so I'd WIN that collision! \ud83d\udc80\n\nBUT - he might not do that. He might not know I'm winning or might try to avoid me. If he moves UP, DOWN, or RIGHT instead, I'm safe at (4, 7).\n\nAlternatively, I could go LEFT to (2, 7) to create distance and play it safe, but that feels too passive when I'm winning.\n\n**THE KILLER PLAY:**\nGoing RIGHT to (4, 7) puts me in the PERFECT position to either:\n1. Force a head-on collision that I WIN (he dies, I die, but I have more apples so I win!)\n2. Position myself to chase him down and box him in next turn\n\nThis is AGGRESSIVE. This is HOW WE WIN. I'm not scared of the collision - I WANT it if he's dumb enough to take it.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nForce confrontation while maintaining advantage. If he avoids collision, I'll use my body position to start boxing him into the right side of the board. Push him toward (9,9) wall and trap him. Stay mobile but aggressive.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGoing RIGHT to (4, 7). Let's see if he wants to play chicken! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, Chat, peep the opponent data!\n\n**OPPONENTS DATA:** Snake #1 - Head: (4, 7), Body: [(3, 7)], Apples: 1.\n\nThe enemy moved **RIGHT** from (3, 7) to (4, 7)! If we had stuck around the center three turns ago, we would have been in the thick of it! Our strategy to move to the right flank is paying off big time by maximizing distance! Their move to (4, 7) confirms they were prioritizing the (4, 6) apple, or trying to block anyone coming from the right.\n\n*   **Closest Apples:** (7, 7) is begging for us!

If they move RIGHT to (5, 7), or UP/DOWN, they cannot reach (7, 7). (7, 7) is totally safe from them this turn.\n    *   *Strategic:* Immediate growth!

The enemy's priorities are likely the (4, 6) apple or consolidating the center.\n\n*   **1. DOWN (4, 6):** LIKELY. This grabs the (4, 6) apple. They grow to size 3.

Good move if they want to avoid the crowd below.\n*   **4. RIGHT (5, 7):** Safe. Puts them closer to the central action and away from their tail.\n\nNo matter which move the enemy makes, our target (7, 7) is 100% safe. We prioritize growth and dominating the flank!\n\n**We are going for the apple harvest!** We need to match their score and then start applying pressure!\n\n***\n\n### Long-Term Strategy (Next 3 Turns):\n\n1.  **Turn 5 (Now):** Move RIGHT to (7, 7) and eat the apple.

We are locked, loaded, and ready to dominate this top-right quadrant!\n\n### Turn 6 Situation Analysis:\n\n**We executed the plan flawlessly!** We grabbed the (7, 7) apple.\n\n*   **Our Head (0):** (7, 7). Size 2. Body [(6, 7)].\n*   **Enemy Head (1):** (5, 7). Size 2. Body [(4, 7)].\n\nWait, Chat, did you peep the opponent's move?\nLast turn, the enemy was at (4, 7), tail at (3, 7). They moved **RIGHT** to (5, 7)! This means they didn't go for the (4, 6) apple. They seem to be prioritizing mobility and keeping the center horizontal lane clear, or maybe they are trying to box me in? But we already pivoted! This is perfect!\n\nThe enemy is now horizontally adjacent to us: we are at (7, 7), they are at (5, 7). Two spaces apart. This is getting TENSE!\n\n### Immediate Goals:\n\n1.  **Growth & Domination:** Grab the (8, 7) apple. This is the second step in our three-turn plan to build a massive wall on the right.\n2.  **Board Control:** Block off the top-right corner to make it *our* territory.\n3.  **Pressure:** Keep growing faster than the enemy. If we hit the next apple, we become Size 3, Head at (8, 7). The enemy is Size 2.\n\n### Evaluating Moves from Our Head (7, 7):\n\nWe are at (7, 7). The enemy head is at (5, 7).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 8):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Avoids immediate pressure.\n    *   *Strategic:* Good, but delays the (8, 7) apple. It points us toward the (8, 8) apple and the upper territory.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves us away from the apples and into a potentially crowded row (Row 6 has apples at (4, 6) and (2, 6)). Passive move.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 7):** **INSTA-CRASH!** We crash into our own body segment at (6, 7). Forbidden move! DOA!\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 7):** ***APPPPPLE!***\n    *   *Safety:* **CRITICAL CHECK.** Is (8, 7) safe?\n        *   Enemy is at (5, 7). If they move UP, DOWN, or LEFT, they cannot possibly reach (8, 7).\n        *   If the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (6, 7), they are still two spaces away.\n        *   If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (4, 7), or **DOWN** to (5, 6), or **UP** to (5, 8), we are safe.\n        *   (8, 7) is 100% safe. We prioritize growth!\n\n### Rival's Potential Moves from (5, 7):\n\nEnemy is Size 2, tail at (4, 7). They are directly challenging the center lane.\n\n*   **1. UP (5, 8):** Safe. Points them toward the (8, 8) apple or the (4, 8) territory.\n*   **2. DOWN (5, 6):** Safe. Puts them near the (4, 6) apple, though it's still safer for them to move UP or LEFT to gain distance from us.\n*   **3. LEFT (4, 7):** **INSTA-CRASH!** They crash into their own body segment at (4, 7). Impossible move.\n*   **4. RIGHT (6, 7):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe for them. This move puts their head right where our *tail* is right now! Their head at (6, 7) means future interaction is imminent!\n\nRegardless of their move, our move to (8, 7) secures another apple and continues our dominance of the right flank. This is the optimal, aggressive, high-value move. We need to get big, Chat!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (K.I.T. - Keep It Tight):\n\n1.  **Turn 6 (Now):** Move RIGHT to (8, 7) and eat the apple. (Size 3, Head at 8, 7, Tail at 6, 7). SCORE 2-1! We pull ahead!\n2.  **Turn 7:** Move UP to (8, 8) and grab that apple too! (Size 4, Head at 8, 8). This builds a solid 3-segment wall along the border: (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8).\n3.  **Turn 8:** Evaluate the enemy's position. If they have moved up towards (5, 8), we can potentially move to (9, 8) to secure the top-right corner, or move LEFT to (7, 8) to prepare a push down. We are creating a bottleneck.\n\nLet's execute step 2 of the plan and get this second apple! We are turning the corner!\n\nRIGHT",

If he moves LEFT to (5, 7) and I move RIGHT to (6, 7), we have a HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both snakes die! That's a DOUBLE KO! But wait... if ALL snakes die, the snake with MORE apples wins... but we're TIED at 1 apple each! That would be a DRAW! I DON'T WANT A DRAW! I WANT TO WIN! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION:**\n1. **RIGHT to (6, 7)**: \n   - That's where the enemy head CURRENTLY is! If he stays still or moves, I die on arrival!\n   - If he moves LEFT, we collide at (5, 7) \u2192 BOTH DEAD \u2192 DRAW! BAD!\n   - If he moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT, I die moving into his body! \n   - This is basically SUICIDE! \u274c DEAD!\n\n2. **LEFT to (4, 7)**:\n   - That's MY BODY! I'd die! \u274c DEAD!\n\n3. **DOWN to (5, 6)**:\n   - Empty! Safe!\n   - Moves me away from immediate collision risk!\n   - Opens up vertical movement!\n   - Enemy can't immediately kill me next turn!\n   - Apple at (4, 6) is reachable! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n4. **UP to (5, 8)**:\n   - Empty! Safe!\n   - Moves me away from enemy!\n   - Apple at (4, 8)? Actually no apple there...\n   - But keeps options open!\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nCHAT, WE'RE TIED! I can't risk a double KO draw! I need to SURVIVE and outmaneuver him! Moving RIGHT is INSTADEATH right now! \n\nI'll go **DOWN** to (5, 6) to escape this row and create distance. The enemy is trapped near the right wall at x=6. If I go down, I can:\n- Potentially chase apples at (4, 6) or (2, 6)\n- Force the enemy to keep moving RIGHT toward the wall\n- Create space to plan a proper ambush\n- Avoid the draw scenario!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDodge this collision threat, then start circling around from below. Use the bottom of the board to approach from a different angle. Force him into the corner at (9, 9) or (9, 8) where he'll have nowhere to go. Stay alive first, dominate second!\n\n**DECISION:**\nGoing DOWN to escape the kill zone! Let him make the first move!\n\nDOWN",

LET'S GOOO!\n\n### Turn 7 Situation Analysis:\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   **Head:** (8, 7)\n*   **Body:** [(7, 7), (6, 7)] - Size 3.\n*   **Target:** We are fully committed to the top-right blockade strategy! Next target? The (8, 8) or (9, 9) apples!\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (5, 6)\n*   **Body:** [(5, 7)] - Size 2.\n*   Wait, Chat, did you see that move? The enemy was at (5, 7) and moved **DOWN** to (5, 6). They are ducking away from us and heading for the center! Maybe they want the (4, 6) apple? Or maybe they just felt the pressure of our awesome presence? Either way, they abandoned the high ground! Foolish!\n\n### Enemy Prediction & Pressure:\n\nThe enemy is now at (5, 6).\n*   **Possible Enemy Moves:**\n    *   **UP (5, 7):** Moves back to their previous position. Safe, but passive.\n    *   **DOWN (5, 5):** Safe, moves them toward the open center.\n    *   **LEFT (4, 6):** **APPLE!** Highly likely, as they need to catch up in score and this apple is right there.\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 6):** Safe. Moves them parallel to us, but behind our current body segment (6, 7).\n\nWe are currently 3 segments long, creating a formidable wall at (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7). This cuts off the entire upper right quadrant, which is now *our* territory! Time to secure the next apple!\n\n### Evaluating Moves from Our Head (8, 7):\n\nWe are at (8, 7). The board is clear where we want to go.\n\n1.  **UP (8, 8):** ***APPLE!***\n    *   *Safety:* Is (8, 8) safe? Absolutely! The enemy is far away at (5, 6). No collision risk.\n    *   *Strategic:* Secures another apple! We become Size 4! This is the core of the plan. It pushes us into the (9, 9) apple territory. We form a perfect 'L' shape corner wall!\n\n2.  **DOWN (8, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves us away from the immediate apples. Less efficient.\n\n3.  **LEFT (7, 7):** **INSTA-CRASH!** We crash into our own body segment. Forbidden!\n\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 7):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Also good, moves us along the wall. But (8, 8) is an apple, so we prioritize growth! (9, 7) is a viable backup move if (8, 8) weren't an apple.\n\n### The Aggressive Play:\n\nThe optimal move is clearly **UP** to (8, 8). It gets us another apple, pushing our score to 3 and our size to 4. We will be dominating the board size-wise.\n\nIf the enemy moves to (4, 6) and grabs that apple, they will be score 2, size 3. We maintain the lead in both metrics (3 apples, size 4). This is exactly what we want! Pressure, pressure, pressure!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (K.I.T. - Keep It Tight):\n\n1.  **Turn 7 (Now):** Move UP to (8, 8) and eat the apple. (Size 4, Head at 8, 8). SCORE 3-1! We extend the lead!\n2.  **Turn 8:** From (8, 8), the most aggressive moves are RIGHT to (9, 8) or UP to (8, 9). We should look to secure the (9, 9) apple next, or drive down the right wall to (9, 6). Our goal is to build an impenetrable 'U' shape along the top and right walls, boxing out the center-left.\n3.  **Future Target:** Once we've secured the top-right corner, we will check the enemy's progress on the (4, 6) apple and begin our pivot to force them into a head-on or a body-strike collision. We need to maintain our size advantage!\n\nLet's do this, Chat! Time to get HUGE!\n\nUP",

The enemy is only size 3! We are beasts in the top-right quadrant! LET'S GOOOOO!\n\n### Turn 8 Situation Analysis\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   **Head:** (8, 8) - We just ate the apple! Glorious!\n*   **Body:** [(8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7)] - Size 4!\n*   **Target:** We continue to dominate the high ground! The (9, 9) apple is calling, and we want to solidify our wall on the right side.\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (4, 6) - Uh oh, Chat! They moved left from (5, 6) and just snagged the (4, 6) apple! Smart move, but they are still behind!\n*   **Body:** [(5, 6), (5, 7)] - Size 3.\n*   **Recent Move:** LEFT to (4, 6).\n\nThe enemy is now positioned centrally, slightly to the left, and is feeling the heat! They are at (4, 6) right now.\n\n### Enemy Prediction & Vulnerability:\n\nThe enemy just ate an apple, so they are feeling good, but they are clearly boxed out of the top right by our magnificent body segments at (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7)!\n\nWhat are their likely next moves from (4, 6)?\n\n*   **UP (4, 7):** Safe, but takes them into a corner near our body (6, 7) and blocks the (3, 8) apple route.\n*   **DOWN (4, 5):** Safe, moves them toward the center-left. This seems most likely for open space, maybe towards the (3, 5) apple.\n*   **LEFT (3, 6):** Safe, moves them closer to the wall.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 6):** **INSTA-CRASH!** They can't move back into their *new* body segment (5, 6), which was their old head position. Wait, no, their *new* body segment is their old head position (5, 6), and their tail remains (5, 7). Ah, the rules state you can't move into the cell behind your head, which would be (5, 6). WRONG. The tail is (5, 7). Their head moved from (5, 6) to (4, 6). The segment instantly *behind* their head (4, 6) is (5, 6). Moving right to (5, 6) is moving into their body. **This is an immediate death move for them!** They cannot move RIGHT!\n\n*Self-Correction on Enemy Body:*\nHead: (4, 6)\nBody: [(5, 6), (5, 7)]\nTail remains: (5, 7) (since they just grew)\nThe cell they occupied one turn ago: (5, 6).\nThey CANNOT move to (5, 6) as it is the segment immediately following their head.\n\n**Therefore, the enemy only has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.** They are potentially cornered by their own growing body! This is huge!\n\n### Evaluating Our Moves from (8, 8):\n\nWe are at (8, 8), solidifying our position as the dominant force on the board.\n\n1.  **UP (8, 9):** Safe. Moves along the top wall. Good for eventually setting up the (9, 9) apple.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 7):** **INSTA-CRASH!** Backwards into our body segment. Forbidden!\n3.  **LEFT (7, 8):** Safe. Moves us toward the center of the top wall, potentially to block the enemy from the top apples (like (8, 9) or (9, 9) if we don't get there first).\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 8):** Safe. Excellent move along the right wall. Sets up the path to (9, 9).\n\n### Strategic Decision: Continuing the Blockade and Dominating Territory\n\nWe have the size lead (4 to 3) and the score lead (3 to 2)! We need to use our size to control key parts of the board, trapping the enemy. We are already doing a great job on the right side.\n\nWe have a clear path to two more apples: (9, 9) and (0, 8), but they are far apart. Let's focus on securing the corner first.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (9, 8) is a strong territorial move. It perfectly extends our blocking wall downward and sets us up directly under the (9, 9) apple path.\n\nMoving **UP** to (8, 9) is also strong, pushing us onto the top wall, but it delays securing the full right wall.\n\nLet's prioritize boxing in the enemy from the *right*. The enemy is still far away, so we have time to establish position.\n\nGoing **RIGHT** to (9, 8):\n*   Puts our head adjacent to the outside wall.\n*   Next turn we can move UP to (9, 9) for an apple, or DOWN to (9, 7) to block off the right side.\n*   This is the most aggressive territorial move.\n\nGoing **UP** to (8, 9):\n*   Puts our head adjacent to the outside wall.\n*   Next turn we can move RIGHT to (9, 9) for an apple.\n*   This is slightly more direct to the (9, 9) apple.\n\nThe difference is minor, both lead to the (9, 9) apple. Let's take the path that gives us maximum coverage *now*. (9, 8) feels like it cuts off more potential enemy movement down the right side, although the enemy is currently far left.\n\nI prefer **RIGHT** to (9, 8) to secure the perimeter completely before eating the (9, 9) apple. We are just building our fortress, Chat!\n\nWait, let's re-examine the next move after (9, 8).\nIf we go **RIGHT** (9, 8): Next we can go UP (9, 9, Apple), or DOWN (9, 7).\n\nIf we go **UP** (8, 9): Next we can go RIGHT (9, 9, Apple), or LEFT (7, 9).\n\nSince 9, 9 is an apple, both moves essentially guarantee the next apple. Let's take the one that extends our wall of dominance the furthest. (9, 8) means our body now covers (6, 7) through (9, 7) and (8, 8). That's a massive wall!\n\nLet's go **RIGHT** and reinforce the right flank!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (K.I.T. - Keep It Tight):\n\n1.  **Turn 8 (Now):** Move RIGHT to (9, 8). Secure the right wall. (Size 4, Head at 9, 8).\n2.  **Turn 9:** Move UP to (9, 9) and eat the apple. (Size 5, Head at 9, 9).\n3.  **Turn 10+:** Drive DOWN the right wall (9, 8, 9, 7, 9, 6, etc.) to link up with the bottom, completely walling off the right 1/3 of the board. This forces the enemy into the middle or left, where they are weaker and have fewer open apples. We use our size advantage to create an absolute territorial lock! Time to build the mega-maze!\n\nRIGHT",

We are the superior snake, size 4 to their size 3! We just moved to (9, 8) and solidified our amazing right-side wall! Now it's time to cash in on that high-ground advantage! We are going for the (9, 9) apple! LET'S GOOO!\n\n### Turn 9 Situation Analysis\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 8)\n*   **Body:** [(8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)] - Size 4. We are long!\n*   **Target:** The (9, 9) apple. It's RIGHT THERE!\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (4, 7). WHOA! Did you see that move, Chat?! They went UP from (4, 6) to (4, 7). Smart, defensive move, trying to stay central and avoid being crushed by our dominant presence.\n*   **Body:** [(4, 6), (5, 6)] - Size 3.\n*   **Vulnerability:** They are currently in column 4, rows 7, 6, and 5. They are starting to run into apples like (3, 8) and (3, 9), but they are far from escaping our shadow!\n\n### Immediate Threat Assessment (Head-to-Head)\n\nOur head is at (9, 8). Their head is at (4, 7). We are miles apart. No immediate head-to-head collision possible. Phew!\n\n### Evaluating Our Moves from (9, 8):\n\nWe are right on the top-right edge. We only have three physically safe directions, as moving RIGHT sends us off the board (which is an instant kill).\n\n1.  **UP (9, 9):** *APPLE ALERT!* This is a safe move. We eat the apple, we grow to size 5, and we take control of the corner. This is the **Power Move**!\n2.  **DOWN (9, 7):** Safe. Moves us along the wall, but away from the apple. This would continue building our wall, but we should grab the apple first, right, Chat?\n3.  **LEFT (8, 8):** **INSTA-CRASH!** That's our body segment! Forbidden!\n\nWait, let's re-examine our body for T-9:\nHead: (9, 8)\n*   The segment *directly behind* is (8, 8).\n*   Moving LEFT to (8, 8) would be moving directly into our own neck. **DANGER!**\n\nOkay, so we have only two safe, non-fatal moves: **UP** or **DOWN**.\n\n### Strategic Decision: UP for the Apple!\n\nWe plotted this perfectly! The move UP to (9, 9) is safe, eats an apple, increases our score to 4, and increases our size to 5! This monumental size difference will allow us to start actively hunting the enemy.\n\nThe enemy at (4, 7) might go:\n*   UP to (4, 8) (near the (3, 8) apple).\n*   DOWN to (4, 6) (into their body, INSTA-CRASH!). No, actually, their body is [(4, 6), (5, 6)]. They cannot move into (4, 6).\n*   LEFT to (3, 7).\n*   RIGHT to (5, 7).\n\nSince they can't go down or right (into their body segments), they must go UP or LEFT. If they go UP to (4, 8), they are still far from us. If they go LEFT to (3, 7), they are moving away. We have no concerns this turn.\n\nWe execute the plan! Grab the apple! Use our size advantage to dominate the map!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (K.I.T. - Keep It Tight):\n\n1.  **Turn 9 (Now):** Move UP to (9, 9). Eat the apple. (Size 5, Head at 9, 9).\n2.  **Turn 10:** Drive DOWN the right wall (9, 8, 9, 7, etc.) and wall off the entire eastern flank. This forces the opponent to deal with the center-left cluster of apples or risk getting suffocated by our immense girth. We need to maintain this size advantage and start cornering him!\n\nUP",

This could be risky if enemy moves left.\n- **LEFT to (3,7)** moves me toward the top-left apple cluster (3,9, 3,8, 0,8, 2,9) while staying safe. It's also away from the enemy's current position.\n- **RIGHT to (5,7)** moves me east toward the right side where there are fewer apples and the enemy is.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nI want to claim the left side where apples are clustered (top-left area). Enemy is in top-right. If I keep moving left and up, I can cut off their access to the left side and potentially force them into a corner. Moving left gives me the most options and keeps me away from direct confrontation until I'm ready with a higher score.\n\n**DECISION:** \nMoving **LEFT to (3,7)** to start controlling the left side and positioning for the apple cluster. This gives me better board control and avoids immediate risk from the enemy's position.\n\nLEFT",

We are now a *menacing* size 5! Let's examine the board and box this fool in!\n\n### Turn 10 Situation Analysis\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 9) - Cornered, powerful!\n*   **Body:** [(9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)] - Size 5. We are dominating the right side. We have total board control of the Eastern wall!\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (3, 7). WHOA! They moved from (4, 7) to (3, 7)! A defensive maneuver, trying to stay central-left and away from our massive girth!\n*   **Body:** [(4, 7), (4, 6)] - Size 3. They are still tiny.\n\n**The Board for Reference:**\n 9 . .

Still miles apart. No danger of a head-on collision this turn, Chat! We can be aggressive!\n\n### Evaluating Our Moves from (9, 9):\n\nWe are in the top-right corner. Only two possible moves! UP and RIGHT are insta-deaths.\n\n1.  **DOWN (9, 8):** Safe. This is our body segment! Wait a minute, what are the rules again, Chat?\n    *   Our body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)]\n    *   The segment *directly behind* our head (9, 9) is (9, 8).\n    *   **CRITICAL RULE CHECK:** Moving directly BACKWARDS into the cell behind our head is a **forbidden, instant death move** in this variant!\n\n    Wait! Let's check the body list from Turn 9 to Turn 10.\n    *   T9 Head was (9, 8). Body was [(8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)].\n    *   T9 Move was UP to (9, 9).\n    *   T10 Head is (9, 9). Body is [(9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)].\n    *   The cell *directly behind* the new head (9, 9) is (9, 8).\n    *   If we move DOWN to (9, 8), we are moving into our immediate neck. **THIS IS A CRASH. DO NOT DO THIS!** (Thank goodness we have the VOD review, Chat!)\n\n    **ELIMINATING DOWN.** Down is an instant death. \ud83d\ude35\n\n2.  **LEFT (8, 9):** Safe. This moves us onto an empty cell and keeps us on the top wall. This is the **ONLY safe move!**\n\n### Strategic Decision: LEFT, then Down the Wall!\n\nSince moving DOWN is suicide, we must move LEFT to (8, 9). This continues the process of \"walling off\" the top of the board and forces the opponent further into the center-left.\n\n**If we move LEFT to (8, 9):**\nOur head is now at (8, 9). We still have apples (0, 9) and (3, 9) on the top row, but they are far.\n\n**What will the Enemy (1) do from (3, 7)?**\nThey are clearly heading toward the center-left. Their safe moves are:\n*   UP (3, 8) \u2013 **APPLE!** Highly likely. They grab an apple, size 4.\n*   DOWN (3, 6).\n*   LEFT (2, 7) \u2013 Near the (2, 6) apple.\n*   RIGHT (4, 7) \u2013 **INSTA-CRASH!** Into their body segment! No way.\n\nIf they are smart (and they are, they're our archrival), they are going **UP to (3, 8)** to snag the apple. This means they will grow to size 4, but we still maintain our dominant size 5 and score 4 to 3!\n\nOur goal is to continue extending our body to force the enemy into tighter spaces. Moving LEFT (8, 9) sets us up perfectly for our next move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (K.I.T. - Keep It Tight):**\n1.  **Turn 10 (Now):** Move LEFT to (8, 9). Consolidate the top-right wall.\n2.  **Turn 11:** Move DOWN to (8, 8). This keeps our body dense and reinforces the wall, pushing the opponent further left.\n3.  **Turn 12/13:** Continue moving down the left side of our existing body (7, 8), (6, 8), etc., creating a massive impenetrable structure. We are going to divide the board! Let's get this $L$ move, Chat! It's the only way to survive!\n\nLEFT",

That's crashing into myself. **DEAD!** \u274c\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION:**\n- **RIGHT is INSTADEATH** into my own body\u2014no-go!\n- **UP, DOWN, LEFT are all SAFE** (UP even gets an apple!).\n\n**STRATEGY THINKING:**\nI'm trailing by 2 apples, so I NEED to eat. UP to (3,8) gets me an apple immediately\u2014+1 score, grow, and puts me closer to the top-left apple cluster (3,9, 0,8, 2,9). Enemy is stuck in the top-right corner; they're unlikely to come my way soon. Moving DOWN or LEFT avoids the apple but keeps me in the same area. Why pass up free content? Eating the apple boosts my score toward #0 and stretches my body, giving me more reach to dominate the left side. Plus, from (3,8), I can pivot to (3,9) for another apple or swing down later. This aggressive eat-and-hold strategy forces #0 to stay cornered or risk coming into my turf.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nClaim the top-left cluster, grow fast to match #0's score, then snake around to box them in the corner. If I can get within 1-2 apples, I'll force a head-on collision and end this! Stay alive, stay hungry, stay lethal.\n\nUP  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

We are the alpha snake on this 10x10 grid!\n\n### Turn 11 Situation Analysis\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   **Head:** $(8, 9)$. Top edge control confirmed!\n*   **Body:** $[(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)]$. We've created an L-shaped fortress in the top-right corner.\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** $(3, 8)$. WHOA! They grabbed the apple at $(3, 8)$! They are smart, Chat!\n*   **Body:** $[(3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6)]$. They are now size 4! They are trying to catch up in size!\n\n**Board State (Important Check):**\n 9 . . A A . . . . 0 T  (Our Head (8, 9) is chilling on the 'T' above its x=8.)\n 8 A . . 1 . . . .

A . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n*(Note: The board state shown in the prompt already reflects the enemy taking the apple and our move, which is great!)*\n\n### Immediate Threat Assessment\n\nOur head at $(8, 9)$ is miles away from their head at $(3, 8)$. No head-to-head collision risk this turn. We have tactical freedom!\n\n### Evaluating Our Moves from $(8, 9)$:\n\nWe are currently on the top boundary.\n\n1.  **UP $(8, 10)$:** KABOOM! Off the board! \ud83d\ude35 ELIMINATED!\n2.  **RIGHT $(9, 9)$:** We move into our immediate neck. Our body starts with $(9, 9)$. This is an instant death move! \ud83d\ude35 ELIMINATED!\n3.  **LEFT $(7, 9)$:** Safe. Continues along the top wall. Keeps us high and wide. An apple is nearby at $(3, 9)$ we could go for, but this seems like stalling.\n4.  **DOWN $(8, 8)$:** Safe. We move next to our body segment $(8, 7)$. This is the key move for reinforcing the wall we started building.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Close the Wall!\n\nOur long-term plan was to create a massive wall and divide the board. Moving **DOWN** to $(8, 8)$ is the *perfect* execution of this plan.\n\n**Why DOWN is superior to LEFT:**\n*   Moving LEFT $(7, 9)$ exposes our long body line $[(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)]$ on the right side. It allows the enemy more maneuverability in the center and doesn't restrict them.\n*   Moving DOWN $(8, 8)$ tightens our formation. Our head will be at $(8, 8)$, directly above $(8, 7)$ and next to $(9, 8)$. We are creating a dense, impenetrable vertical column. This pressures the entire middle of the board and forces the enemy to stay left.\n\n**What will the Enemy (1) do from $(3, 8)$?**\nThey are now size 4. They are surrounded by our presence, other enemy body pieces are far, and their own body is $[(3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6)]$.\n\n*   **UP $(3, 9)$:** **AN APPLE!** Highly likely. If they go UP, they grab the apple and become size 5. We need to be aware.\n*   **LEFT $(2, 8)$:** Safe, moves them toward the (2, 6) apple.\n*   **RIGHT $(4, 8)$:** Safe. This is slightly dangerous as it moves them closer to our side, but they appear to be exploring the center.\n*   **DOWN $(3, 7)$:** Their immediate neck. **CRASH!** They won't do this.\n\nIf they go UP to $(3, 9)$ and get the apple, they tie us for size (both size 5) and score (both 4 apples).\n\nWe must prioritize dominating the board space, even if they score. Moving DOWN to $(8, 8)$ is the strategic choice to maximize our board control. We are setting up a $9 \\times 9$ boundary wall!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Reinforce the East Wall):\n\n1.  **Turn 11 (Now):** Move DOWN to (8, 8). Reinforce the top-right block.\n2.  **Turn 12:** Move LEFT to (7, 8). Continue walling off the top segment.\n3.  **Turn 13/14:** Start moving down the $(7, Y)$ column, slowly constricting the enemy's options and forcing them into the left side of the board. The goal is to make the enemy crash into us or run out of safe space. LET'S GO FOR THE TRAP, CHAT!\n\nDOWN",

Safe! **SAFE!**\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION:**\n- **DOWN is INSTADEATH** into my own body\u2014no-go!\n- **UP, LEFT, RIGHT are all SAFE!** UP gets an apple at (3,9)!\n\n**STRATEGY THINKING:**\nI'm at 3 apples, enemy at 4. I just ate and grew, so my body is longer. From (3,8), I can reach more apples. UP to (3,9) gives me another apple immediately\u2014+1 score, tie me with enemy! That's huge. It also puts me at the top row, opening up more options. From (3,9), I can move LEFT to (2,9) (there's an apple there per list!), or RIGHT to (4,9), or DOWN back to (3,8) (but that might be occupied by my body if I don't move it? Wait, after moving UP, my body shifts: head to (3,9), body becomes [(3,8), (3,7), (4,7)]? Actually, after eating, I grow, so body becomes [(3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (4,6)]? Wait, the tail moves if no apple, but since I ate, I grow: new tail stays at (4,6), new body segments added. So from (3,9), I'll have more space. \nLEFT to (2,8) is safe but no apple\u2014leads to (2,9) which has an apple. RIGHT to (4,8) leads to (4,9) which might have an apple? The apple list includes (9,4), (9,6), etc.\u2014(4,9) isn't listed, but (3,9) is an apple. So UP is the aggressive play\u2014close the score gap immediately! \nEnemy is at (8,9)\u2014if they move left to (7,9), they're still far from me. If they move down to (8,8), that's into their own body? Wait, their body includes (8,8) already? Actually, their body is [(9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]\u2014so (8,8) is their body! So if they move DOWN to (8,8), they'd crash into themselves! They might move LEFT to (7,9) to avoid that. Either way, (3,9) is safe. \nUP dominates the top-left, gets content, and forces #0 to stay cornered. I'm growing to match, then I'll snake around to box them in. Let's eat!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nTake (3,9) apple, tie score at 4. Then target the top-left cluster\u2014(2,9) and (0,8)\u2014to build length and control that quadrant. Keep enemy pinned; if I get to 5 apples, I might have the size to force a head-on collision. Stay aggressive, no backtracking!\n\nUP",
