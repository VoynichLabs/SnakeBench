The board is 10x10 with coordinates (X, Y) where X increases to the right and Y increases upward, from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\nThe board state is given in rows, with row 9 (top) to row 0 (bottom).

A . . . . . . . . . . 1 . . . . . . . . . . 0 . . . . . . . . 0 .\"\n\nIt seems there might be a mistake in parsing. Let's list the rows based on the numbers:\n\n- \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" \u2192 Y=9 row: X=6 is apple (A)\n- \"8 . . . . . . . A . .\" \u2192 Y=8 row: X=8 is apple (A)\n- \"7 . . . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 Probably Y=7: all empty or missing X? Wait, user has \". . . . . . . . . .\" which should be 10 elements, but shown with spaces, so X=6 is apple for Y=6, etc.\n- \"6 . . . . . A . . . .\" \u2192 Y=6 row: X=6 is apple (A)\n- \"5 A . . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 Y=5 row: X=0 is apple (A)\n- \"4 . . . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 Y=4 row: all empty\n- \"3 . . . . . . . 1 . .\" \u2192 Y=3 row: X=7 is enemy snake (1)\n- \"2 . . A . . . . . . .\" \u2192 Y=2 row: X=2 is apple (A)\n- \"1 . . . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 Y=1 row: all empty (user has \"1 . . . . . . . . . .\", but in input it's separate, perhaps \"1\" is start of row)\n- \"0 . . . . . . . . 0 .\" \u2192 Y=0 row: X=8 is my snake (0)\n\nBut the last one has \"0 .\" which might be incomplete, but let's go with that.\n\nOther information:\n\nApples at: (5,6), (2,2), (7,8), (5,9), (0,5)\n\nBut from board state, apples should be A markers.\n\nLet's overlay the board state and apples for consistency.\n\nFrom board state apples:\n- (5,6) should be apple, row Y=6, X=5? Row Y=6 is \". . . . . A . . . .\" so X=6 Y=6, but apple is at (5,6) so (X,Y) or (Y,X)? Coordinates are (X,Y), so for apple at (5,6): X=5, Y=6.\n\nRow Y=6: \". . . . . A . . . .\" so for X=0 to 9, let's index: the tenth character is X=9, but string has characters for X from left.\n\nAssume the string for each row is for X from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nY=9: \". . . . . . A . . .\" \u2014 indices: let's say char positions: 0: '.', 1: '.', 2: '.', 3: '.', 4: '.', 5: '.', 6: 'A', 7: '.', 8: '.', 9: '.'  so X=6, Y=9 is apple at (6,9)\n\nBut apples given: (5,6), (2,2), (7,8), (5,9), (0,5)\n\nSo (5,6): X=5,Y=6 should be apple. From board Y=6 row: \". . . . . A . . . .\" Y=6 is row, so Y=6, what is X? That row has A at position where? In string, it's not explicitly X, but from length, the A is at the 6th position if indexing from 0.\n\nUser says coordinates (X,Y), so in Y=6 row, the apple is at X where? From display: Y=6 row is \"6 . . . . . A . . . .\" so it says the row is for Y=6, and \" . . . . . A . . . .\" so visually, the apple is in the column index 5 if counting from left, starting X=0.\n\n- Row Y=6 has 10 characters: char0 to char9, but the row label \"6\" is before, so for row Y=6, the characters are for X from 0 to 9.\n\nStandard way: \"Row label + string of 10 characters for X from 0 to 9.\"\n\nFor Y=6 row: \" . . . . . A . . . .\" that's 9 characters? No, \" . . . . . A . . . .\" has 9 spaces and an A, but it's listed as part of the input.\n\nPerhaps it's \"6 . . . . . A . . . .\" so the string is \". . . . . A . . . .\" which is 10 characters: positions 0-9.\n\n- Y=6: characters from left: X=0: '.', X=1: '.', X=2: '.', X=3: '.', X=4: '.', X=5: 'A'? No, the sixth character is 'A', but index starting from 1 or 0?\n\nIn programming, usually index 0.\n\nString \" . . . . . A . . . . \" \u2014 let's count the characters between spaces or with spaces?\n\nIt's given with spaces, but the content is dots and A.\n\nFor Y=9: \" . . . . . . A . . . .\" \u2014 10 characters: indices 0 to 9, char[0] = '.', char[1] = '.', ..., char[6] = 'A', etc.\n\nY=6 row is \" . . . . . A . . . .\" \u2014 same for all rows.\n\nBut for Y=6, position: char[5] is 'A' for \" . . . . . A . . . .\" \u2014 let's list:\n\nFor Y=9: \"c0: ., c1: ., c2: ., c3: ., c4: ., c5: ., c6: A, c7: ., c8: ., c9: .\"\n\nX=6 has apple.\n\nSimilarly, Y=8: \"c0: ., c1: ., c2: ., c3: ., c4: ., c5: ., c6: ., c7: ., c8: A, c9: .\" so X=8 apple.\n\nY=6: \"c0: ., c1: ., c2: ., c3: ., c4: ., c5: A, c6: ., c7: ., c8: ., c9: .\" wait no, \" . . . . . A . . . .\" \u2014 here the 'A' is the sixth character, but with 5 dots before? \" . . . . . \" is five characters, each a dot, then \"A\", so c0 to c4: dots, c5: A? c0 to c4 is five characters (indices 0 to 4), then c5: A, but \" . . . . . A . . . .\" \u2014 the string is 10 characters: index 0 to 9.\n\n\"c0: character at position\" usually index 0 to 9.\n\nStandard way: the string represents the grid, so for row Y=6: the sequence is 10 elements for X from 0 to 9.\n\n\" . . . . . A . . . .\" has a space, but it's probably meant to be the cells. Let's count the number of symbols.\n\n\" . . . . . A . . . .\" \u2014 this includes 13 characters, but between dots, so it's ambiguous. Perhaps the dots are the grid cells.\n\nI think there's a bit of confusion in the input. Let me re-read user message.\n\nUser: \"Board state: 9 . . . . . A . . . .  8 . . . . . . . A . . . . 7 . . . . . . . . . . 6 . . . . . A . . . . 5 A . . . . . . . . . . 4 . . . . . . . . . . 3 . . . . . . . 1 . . . . 2 . . A . . . . . . . . . . 1 . . . . . . . . . . 0 . . . . . . . . 0 .\"\n\nThis is messy. Let's split by the row numbers.\n\nRows are labeled, then the string.\n\nSo:\n\n- After \"9\":  \" . . . . . A . . . . \"  but this has extra dots. \" . . . . . A . . . . \" \u2014 perhaps it's 10 dots and an A, but A is a single character.\n\nPerhaps the board is displayed with each cell separated, so for Y=9: X=0 to 9: all '.' except X=6 is 'A'\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor apples given: (5,6) apple, so at (X=5,Y=6)\n\nFrom Y=6 row: \" . . . . . A . . . .\" let's parse this string: assuming no leading spaces, \" . . . . . A . . . . \" \u2014 the '.' are separators or part of the grid?\n\nI think it's better to ignore the dots and A as the grid indicators.\n\nStandard board display: each cell is represented.\n\nFor simplicity, let's list all board state cells and compare to given apples.\n\nApples at: (5,6), (2,2), (7,8), (5,9), (0,5)\n\n- (5,6): X=5,Y=6, row Y=6, X=5\n\n- From Y=6 row: \" . . . . . A . . . .\" \u2014 if we list the characters: 1st: . (X=0), 2nd: . (X=1), 3rd: . (X=2), 4th: . (X=3), 5th: . (X=4, but \" . . . . . \" might be five elements if counted as separate), let's index properly.\n\n\" . . . . . A . . . .\" \u2014 this is 10 elements if we consider the dots and A as separate characters.\n\nc0 = '.', c1 = '.', c2 = '.', c3 = '.', c4 = '.', c5 = 'A', c6 = '.', c7 = '.', c8 = '.', c9 = '.' for Y=6 row.\n\nBut \" . . . . . A . . . .\" has five dots, then A, then three dots, but the numbers might indicate the count.\n\nPerhaps the dots are part of the visualization.\n\nI think it's easier to use the given US coordinates.\n\nMy snake head at (8,0) which is bottom row, X=8.\n\nLast move was RIGHT, so from original (8,0) to (8,1)\n\nNow, current head: (8,0) since no movement? No, last move was RIGHT, so after that move, head is now at (8,1) I think.\n\nBut the board state shows Y=0 row: \"0 . . . . . . . . 0 .\" so at X=8, Y=0, there is a '0', which should be my snake head.\n\nSimilarly, Y=3 row: X=7 is '1' enemy head.\n\nSo let's define the board from the state:\n\n- X,Y coordinates:\n- (6,9): apple (from Y=9, X=6)\n- (8,8): apple (from Y=8, X=8)\n- (6,6): apple (from Y=6, X=6)\n- (0,5): apple (from Y=5, X=0)\n- (2,2): apple (from Y=2, X=2)\n- Enemy: at (7,3) from earlier, but board state: Y=3 X=7 is '1'\n- My snake: at (8,0) from board state, but after last move, it should be (8,1) if move was RIGHT from (8,0).\n\nLast move was RIGHT from (8,0), so head position changed to (8,1) if possible.\n\nBut board state says Y=0 X=8 is 0, which is my snake, so if last move was RIGHT, from (8,0) to (8,1), but (8,0) is still marked with '0', but after moving, the position might be occupied.\n\nTypically in snake games, when you move, the head moves to the new cell, and the body extends. But here, it says \"Body: none\" so probably no body yet.\n\nLast user status: \"Head: (8,0)\" but last move indicated moving from there.\n\nFrom the leave message: \"Your last move information:  **START LAST MOVE PICK** RIGHT  **END LAST MOVE PICK**\"\n\nAnd \" **START LAST RATIONALE** etc.\"\n\nBut then in board state, (8,0) is still shown with",
