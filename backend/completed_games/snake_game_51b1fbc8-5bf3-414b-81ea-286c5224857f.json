None of those collide with our candidate targets, so no immediate head-on risk.\n\nWhy LEFT? \u2014 aggressive, smart, and score-aware:\n- Grabbing (5,3) gives us the first apple and puts us up 1-0.

Use the score advantage to force riskier moves from them; only trade a head-on if we still lead. Keep tail awareness as we start growing.\n\nMove time \u2014 let\u2019s make it happen, fans.

Eliminated.\n- LEFT -> (3,3): safe, more aggressive (closer to opponent column x=3) but moves us away from central apples and could limit vertical options next turn.\n- DOWN -> (4,2): safe, drifts away from the fight, keeps options but cedes center.\n- UP -> (4,4): safe, moves into the center, keeps many exits (L/R/U/D next turn except RIGHT will then be safe), and puts us closer to the apple at (5,5). Keeps pressure and mobility.\n\nOpponent possible moves this turn: UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5), or RIGHT (4,6). They cannot move LEFT into (2,6) because that's their body. None of those create a head-on with us this turn, but we must avoid creating a future one while we're trailing.\n\nWhy UP?\n- It keeps the board open around us, preserves multiple safe follow-ups, and moves us toward central apples so we can catch up without risking a head-on while down a point. It also positions us to threaten the middle column and respond to the opponent\u2019s next move. Aggressive but not reckless \u2014 classic stream play. \ud83d\udc0d\u26a1\ufe0f\n\nShort plan:\n- Move UP to secure center and approach (5,5) in the next 1\u20132 turns.\n- Avoid forcing head-on trades while we\u2019re behind; instead use superior positioning to hem them towards the walls and cut escape lanes later.\n- Keep tracking their tail and possible shrink/grow changes; force them into tight rows and only trade heads when we have the apple/score advantage.\n\nUP",

I'm moving toward Snake #0's territory\n- Sets up a potential head-on collision if he goes UP to (4, 5) \u2192 BOTH DIE!

This forces Snake #0 to react. If he goes UP, we collide and I WIN with higher score. If he goes RIGHT or LEFT, I can chase him down. This is how you dominate - by taking space and forcing the opponent into bad positions!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nKeep pressing Snake #0, cut off his escape routes, and force him into corners. With my 2-1 lead, a head-on collision is my friend! Use my body to create barriers and box him in. The center-right is MY domain now!\n\nDOWN",

Quick full-think before we move.\n\nCurrent quick facts:\n- Our head = (4,4), body = [(4,3)] (so DOWN is directly backwards into our own body \u2192 instant death). Can't go DOWN.\n- Opponent head = (4,6), body = [(3,6),(2,6)]. They\u2019re one apple up on us (2\u21921). We MUST avoid head-on trades while trailing.\n- Cell (4,5) (UP) is the critical collision square between our head and theirs: if we go UP and they go DOWN, both heads land on (4,5) \u2192 double KO. Since they lead, that\u2019s losing for us. So UP is too risky.\n- RIGHT (5,4) is safe and chases the apple at (5,5), but it\u2019s less aggressive about boxing them and could reduce mobility if we commit toward the apple.\n- LEFT (3,4) is safe, keeps 3+ follow-up exits, moves us toward their column so we can apply pressure and start to hem them without forcing an immediate head-on. This fits aggressive-but-not-suicidal play.\n\nEliminate moves:\n- DOWN = death (backwards into own body).\n- UP = possible head-on with opponent (they can respond DOWN) \u2014 unacceptable while down on apples.\n\nCandidate picks:\n- RIGHT = viable (apple access) but slightly less control of opponent.\n- LEFT = viable, safer vs head-on, preserves many exits, brings us into their column to start boxing.\n\nDecision rationale (short): Choose LEFT. It\u2019s aggressive positioning toward their body line, preserves multiple safe follow-ups, avoids the immediate head-on risk at (4,5), and sets us up to climb and squeeze them toward the wall next turns. We\u2019ll avoid trading heads while trailing; instead we\u2019ll pressure, cut off escape lanes, and only force collisions when we hold the apple/lead.\n\nPlan for the next few turns:\n- Move into their column (LEFT), then look to advance UP to threaten their escape along x=3 while keeping a retreat route.\n- If they overcommit toward our approach, bait a head-on only if we can ensure we have the apples advantage or they have no escape.\n- Prioritize controlling the 3\u20135 x-range to box them against the top wall; pick apples only when it doesn\u2019t open us to a bad head trade.\n\nLEFT",

Out.\n- UP \u2192 (3,5) = shares a cell with opponent\u2019s LEFT move (4,5 \u2192 LEFT to 3,5). If they choose LEFT and we choose UP, it\u2019s a head-on into the same cell \u2192 double KO. We\u2019re trailing, so that\u2019s unacceptable. OUT.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,3) = safe, lots of exits next turn, conservative retreat.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,4) = safe, more aggressive positioning to start boxing them in later.\n\nDecision:\n- We can\u2019t risk UP or RIGHT. DOWN is safe and flexible, but we want to pressure them without forcing a head trade. LEFT gives us a lane to start hemming them toward the top wall while keeping multiple follow-ups. We\u2019ll be aggressive but smart: avoid direct head-on until we have the apple advantage or they\u2019re trapped.\n\nPlan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (2,4) to reposition and threaten their flank.\n- Next turn, look to go UP to (2,5) then RIGHT to (3,5) to cut off escapes \u2014 only force a head collision if we can be sure we won\u2019t lose the apple-count tiebreak.\n- If they sprint for the apple at (5,5), don\u2019t chase recklessly \u2014 use positioning to cut escape lanes instead of a suicide trade.\n- Priority: stay alive, keep multiple exits, box them toward a wall, force them into bad moves, only trade heads when we lead.\n\nLET\u2019S GET HYPED \u2014 lock it in. \ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

Scoreboard is looking spicy! \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\n\n**CURRENT POSITIONS:**\n- **MY HEAD:** (5, 5) \n- **MY BODY:** [(5, 5) wait no, let me recount - I started at (5,5) head with body [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6)], ate apple at (5,5), so now I'm still at (5,5) head with body [(5,5)? No wait, I need to think carefully...\n\nActually, I moved RIGHT to (5,5) and ate the apple there. So my new head is (5,5) and my body is the previous head (4,5) plus the rest: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6)]\n\n- **ENEMY HEAD:** Snake #0 is at (2,4) per the current state\n- **ENEMY BODY:** [(3,4)]\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nLooking at the board, I can see:\n- My head at (5,5) \n- My body at (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)\n- Enemy at (2,4) and (3,4)\n- Apples scattered around: (0,7), (3,1), (9,4), etc.\n\n**ELIMINATING MOVES:**\n\n**RIGHT to (6,5):** \n- Is this empty? Looking at the board... (6,5) shows as empty (no symbol there)\n- This is safe! Moving right away from the enemy, giving me space.\n\n**LEFT to (4,5):**\n- This is MY OWN BODY! I have body at (4,5) - that's the cell I just came from!\n- DEAD if I go LEFT. Can't move back into myself.\n\n**UP to (5,6):**\n- Looking at board... (5,6) shows as empty\n- Safe move! Moving up into open space.\n\n**DOWN to (5,4):**\n- Looking at board... (5,4) shows as empty\n- Safe move! Moving down toward the enemy's territory.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nSnake #0 is at (2,4) - that's DOWN and LEFT from me. If I go DOWN to (5,4), I'm getting closer to him, which is good for aggression but risky.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,5), I'm moving away but staying safe and keeping options open.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,6), I'm moving away and giving myself more breathing room.\n\n**DEEP DIVE - THE KILL MOVE:**\nI want to box him in. Snake #0 is currently at (2,4) with body at (3,4). He's in the bottom-left area.\n\nMy body at (4,5) and (4,6) and (3,6) forms a partial wall. If I go DOWN to (5,4), I'm creating more pressure from the right side, potentially cutting off his escape routes upward.\n\nBut wait - if I go DOWN to (5,4), and he goes UP to (2,5) or RIGHT to (3,4) or LEFT to (1,4), I'm still in a good position to chase.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The board is 10x10. Snake #0 is at (2,4) - pretty low x-coordinate. He's near the left edge.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,5), I'm moving away from him, which might let him breathe. That's not aggressive enough.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,4), I'm getting closer to him, which is more aggressive. I can potentially cut off his right side escape.\n\nBut here's the thing - if I go DOWN, my body will now include (5,5) as the second segment. That means my body is becoming a wall that he can't cross.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI'm going **RIGHT to (6,5)**. Here's why:\n\n1. **Safety First:** Moving away from the enemy keeps me alive. Going DOWN toward him increases collision risk.\n\n2. **Space Management:** The board is small (10x10). Moving RIGHT gives me more maneuvering room in the middle-right area while still being able to track back if needed.\n\n3. **Future Options:** From (6,5), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn - maximum flexibility.\n\n4. **Apple Positioning:** There's an apple at (9,4) - moving RIGHT gets me closer to that potential future apple.\n\n5. **Boxing Strategy:** I can still box him in by moving around his territory from the right side. My body at (5,5) and (4,5) already creates a partial barrier.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nRight now: Grab space and maintain score lead (3-1). Next few turns: Work my way down the right side, then circle back to cut off Snake #0's escape routes. Force him into the bottom-left corner where he'll have no moves left. With my length advantage, I can afford to be patient and methodical.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT starts that shaping \u2014 it gives us lanes to push up the 1\u2011column and chase control of the left side, while still keeping multiple exits (up, down, left) next turn.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- This turn: go LEFT to (1,4) to begin cutting off space and threaten (1,5).\n- Next: look to go UP to (1,5) to contest/grow and control column x=1, then skirt the top wall to box them toward the right.\n- Avoid forcing head-on collisions until we either have the apple advantage or have trapped them with no escape.\n- If they close aggressively, pivot to moves that leave \u22652 escape options; bait them into collisions with their own body if possible.\n\nLock it in \u2014 aggressive but safe.

Now I'm at **3 apples** vs Snake #0's **1 apple**. Scoreboard is looking spicy! \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\n\n**CURRENT POSITIONS:**\n- **MY HEAD:** (6, 5) \n- **MY BODY:** [(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6)] - need to check if this is still accurate based on the board state...\n\nWait, looking at the board state provided:\n```\n 6 . . . . T . . . . .\n 5 . A . . T T 1 . A .\n```\nI see `T` at (5,5) and (4,5), and `1` at (6,5). But the board also shows a body at (4,6) as `T` on row 6. However, looking at the board more carefully:\n- Row 6: ` . . . . T . . . . ` - this shows a `T` at (4,6)\n- Row 5: ` . A . . T T 1 . A . ` - this shows `T` at (4,5) and (5,5), and `1` at (6,5)\n\nSo my body is: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6) - that's 3 body segments plus head = length 4.\n\n- **ENEMY HEAD:** Snake #0 at (1, 4)\n- **ENEMY BODY:** [(2, 4)] - shows as `T` on row 4 at (2,4)\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nLooking at the board:\n- My head at (6,5) \n- My body at (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n- Enemy at (1,4) with body at (2,4)\n- Apples scattered around\n\n**ELIMINATING MOVES:**\n\n**LEFT to (5,5):** \n- This is MY OWN BODY! I have body at (5,5) - that's the cell I just came from!\n- DEAD if I go LEFT. Can't move back into myself.\n\n**UP to (6,6):** \n- Looking at board... Row 6, column 6 is empty (shows `. `)\n- Safe move! Moving up into open space.\n\n**DOWN to (6,4):**\n- Looking at board... Row 4, column 6 is empty (shows `. ` on row 4)\n- Safe move! Moving down toward the enemy's territory.\n\n**RIGHT to (7,5):**\n- Looking at board... Row 5, column 7 is empty (shows `. `)\n- Safe move! Moving further right.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nSnake #0 is at (1,4) - that's DOWN and LEFT from me. He's near the left edge of the board.\n\nMy body forms a partial wall: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6). This is a good defensive structure.\n\n**THE KILL MOVE:**\nI want to box him in and force a head-on collision. Since I'm at 3 apples vs his 1, if I can force a head-on collision while I'm ahead, I win! \ud83d\udc80\n\nSnake #0 is at (1,4). If I move DOWN to (6,4), I'm getting closer to him. But more importantly, let me think about his possible moves this turn.\n\nSnake #0 is at (1,4) with body at (2,4). His possible safe moves this turn:\n- UP to (1,5): Is that safe? Looking at board... Row 5, column 1 shows `A` (apple) - that's safe!\n- DOWN to (1,3): Row 3, column 1 shows `A` (apple) - that's safe!\n- LEFT to (0,4): Row 4, column 0 shows `.` (empty) - that's safe!\n- RIGHT to (2,4): This is HIS OWN BODY! He can't go there.\n\nSo Snake #0 has 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6,4), I'm not getting closer enough to him to force a collision this turn. The distance is still large.\n\n**BETTER STRATEGY:**\nI need to think about where Snake #0 will likely go. He's near the left edge with limited space. If I can predict his move and cut him off, I can trap him.\n\nBut here's the key insight: **I'm already ahead 3-1**. If I can force a head-on collision, I win immediately. So I should actually try to get CLOSER to him, not away.\n\nLooking at my options:\n- UP to (6,6): Moving away, not aggressive\n- DOWN to (6,4): Moving closer, more aggressive\n- RIGHT to (7,5): Moving away, not aggressive\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI'm going **DOWN to (6,4)**. Here's why:\n\n1. **Aggression:** I'm ahead 3-1, so I WANT to force a collision. Moving DOWN gets me closer to Snake #0's territory.\n\n2. **Pressure:** From (6,4), I can threaten to chase him down the board. He's at (1,4), and if he moves RIGHT to (2,5) or something, I can cut him off.\n\n3. **Apple Positioning:** There's an apple at (7,1) and (9,4) - moving DOWN gets me closer to the bottom of the board where there are more apples.\n\n4. **Future Options:** From (6,4), I can still go LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN next turn. Plenty of maneuvering room.\n\n5. **Cutting Off Escape:** My body at (5,5) and (4,5) already blocks some of his upward escape. Moving DOWN positions me to potentially cut off his rightward escape later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nRight now: Move aggressively DOWN to apply pressure. Next few turns: Chase Snake #0 down the board, forcing him toward the left edge. Use my body to create a wall and cut off his escape routes. Once I've cornered him, force a head-on collision to win the game. With my length advantage (3 apples vs 1), I can afford to play aggressively.\n\nDOWN",

Grabs apple \u2192 we GROW (good), and from (1,5) we\u2019ll have 3 escape options next turn (0,5 / 2,5 / 1,6) \u2014 strong flexibility. \ud83c\udf4f\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4): Safe now but hugs the wall; next-turn options drop (only up/down), risk of getting cornered if we overcommit. More aggressive but riskier.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3): Safe and conservative, keeps options open (0,3 / 2,3 / 1,2) \u2014 solid but slower to pressure.\n\nOpponent threat check:\n- They\u2019re 5 cells away; no head-on possible this turn into (1,5)/(0,4)/(1,3). They can\u2019t contest the (1,5) apple this turn, so grabbing it is low-risk and gains ground.\n\nDecision rationale:\n- Grab the apple now. We need to be aggressive and build body presence to start hemming them in \u2014 growth = more leverage to obstruct and bait mistakes. UP gives us growth, maintains multiple escape routes, and starts control of column x=1 without slamming into the wall. Perfect blend of aggression + safety. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc40\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Turn 7: From (1,5), evaluate opponent move. If they drift toward center, skirt up/top and use our growing tail to cut lanes left\u2192right. If they move right, pressure by moving along the top of column 1 and then sweep right to box.\n- Avoid head-on until we have equal-or-greater apples or we can guarantee their only escape is into our body.\n- Keep at least 2\u20133 exit options each turn; only corner them \u2014 don\u2019t be the one cornered.\n\nLET\u2019S GET THAT APPLE, FORCE THEM TO CHASE, AND START BOXING. WHO WANTS IT!? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd2a\n\nUP",

T T T . A .` - Snake #0 at (1,5), body at (1,4), (2,4)\n- Row 4 shows: `. T T . . . 1 . . A` - My head at (6,4), body continues to (5,5) and (4,5)\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER ASSESSMENT:**\n\nSnake #0 is at (1,5) - he's RIGHT next to me! We're only 5 columns apart (columns 1 vs 6). The gap is closing!\n\n**ELIMINATING MOVES:**\n\n**UP to (6,5):** \n- That's MY OWN BODY! I have body at (6,5) - that's where I just came from!\n- DEAD if I go UP. Can't move backwards into myself.\n\n**DOWN to (6,3):**\n- Looking at board... Row 3, column 6 shows `.` (empty) - that's SAFE!\n\n**LEFT to (5,4):**\n- Looking at board... Row 4, column 5 shows `.` (empty) - that's SAFE!\n\n**RIGHT to (7,4):**\n- Looking at board... Row 4, column 7 shows `.` (empty) - that's SAFE!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nSnake #0 has been growing! He went from 1 apple to 2 apples. He's now at (1,5) - he moved UP to get that apple. Now he's positioned to potentially move RIGHT toward the center.\n\n**THE KILL OPPORTUNITY:**\nI'm ahead 3-2! If I can force a head-on collision NOW, I win! But he's at (1,5) and I'm at (6,5) - we're 5 spaces apart. He can't reach me this turn.\n\n**MOVEMENT STRATEGY:**\n\nI need to:\n1. Cut off his escape routes\n2. Chase him down while maintaining safety\n3. Keep my options open\n\nLooking at the board:\n- He's near the left edge with his body at (1,4) and (2,4)\n- If he moves RIGHT, he could go to (2,5) or (2,4) - but (2,4) is his body!\n- So his likely moves are: UP (1,6), DOWN (1,4 - but that's his body!), or LEFT (0,5 - off board?)\n\n**WAIT!** Row 5 shows `. 0 . . .` at columns 0-4, and column 0 is `.` (empty). So he CAN go LEFT to (0,5)!\n\nBut there's an apple at (0,7) - that might be his target.\n\n**MY BEST MOVE:**\n\nI need to close the gap while staying safe. Let me check:\n\n- **LEFT to (5,4):** This moves me TOWARD him! From (6,4) to (5,4) reduces distance. It also opens up future paths and doesn't trap me. This is AGGRESSIVE!\n\n- **DOWN to (6,3):** This moves AWAY from him (south). Not ideal when I want to force collision.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,4):** This moves AWAY from him (further east). Definitely not aggressive.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\n\nI'm going **LEFT to (5,4)**! Here's why:\n\n1. **AGGRESSION:** I'm ahead 3-2, so I WANT to force a collision. Moving LEFT closes the distance and puts pressure on Snake #0.\n\n2. **POSITIONING:** From (5,4), I can:\n   - Chase him RIGHT next turn if he moves up\n   - Cut off his escape routes\n   - Block his path to the center\n\n3. **BODY PRESERVATION:** My body currently at (6,5) will move to (6,4) as my new tail position. This maintains my wall structure.\n\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (5,4), I'll have UP to (5,5) - but wait, (5,5) is my body! So that's NOT an option. But I'll have DOWN to (5,3), LEFT to (4,4), and RIGHT to (6,4). Still plenty of maneuvering room.\n\n5. **THE TRAP:** If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (2,5) (which seems likely to chase apples), I'll be at (5,4) and can continue chasing him down the middle. If he goes LEFT or UP, I can adjust my path to cut him off.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 8: From (5,4), depending on where Snake #0 goes, I'll chase him. If he goes RIGHT to (2,5), I'll go LEFT to (4,4) to close in. If he goes UP to (1,6), I'll go UP to (5,5) - wait no, that's my body! Let me recalculate... Actually from (5,4), UP is blocked by my body at (5,5). So I'd need to go LEFT or DOWN or RIGHT. Hmm, that's limiting. Maybe I need to reconsider...\n\n**RETHINKING FROM (5,4):**\nIf I'm at (5,4):\n- UP to (5,5) = MY BODY = DEAD\n- DOWN to (5,3) = empty = SAFE\n- LEFT to (4,4) = empty = SAFE  \n- RIGHT to (6,4) = empty = SAFE\n\nSo I have 3 safe options from there. That's still good!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nClose the distance, force Snake #0 toward the left wall, and create a situation where I can corner him. With my length advantage (3-2), I can win any head-on collision!\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

No backpedals \u2014 we\u2019re not that kinda snake. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,5): legal but hugs the wall. Only ~2 good exits next turn (up/down). Risky; easy to get boxed. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,5): moves toward center \u2014 tempting. But one follow-up is into our current tail (2,4) which is sketchy unless it vacates; fewer guaranteed safe options. Middle-ground play. \ud83e\udd14\n- UP \u2192 (1,6): clean, gives 3 solid escape options (0,6 / 2,6 / 1,7). Keeps maximum flexibility while positioning to start pressuring the board. \u2705\n\nOpponent threat check:\n- Enemy at (6,4) with neck at (6,5) \u2014 they CAN\u2019T move up, and they\u2019re 4+ cells away. No immediate head-on threat. They\u2019re ahead 3\u21922 apples, so we avoid forcing a head-on while trailing.\n\nDecision & WHY:\n- Take UP. It\u2019s the safest aggressive play: we grow our presence vertically, maximize future moves (3-way freedom), and preserve options to swing right later to box them in. We need time and body length to force a collision on our terms \u2014 UP helps build that leverage without getting trapped.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Climb column x=1 (gain space), then pivot right across the mid/top to corral the opponent\u2019s horizontal lanes.\n- Avoid head-on unless we equal or surpass their apples or we can guarantee they have zero escape.\n- Always keep 2\u20133 exits; bait them toward our longer body and cut off lanes rather than suiciding for points.\n\nLET\u2019S GET IT \u2014 pressurize, expand, and trap.

Build length and board control.\n- UP keeps max escape routes, lets us go for (1,9) safely in a couple turns, and gives space to swing right to start corralling them.\n- LEFT is too wall-huggy; RIGHT is okay but less flexible. UP is the cleanest aggressive play.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Climb x=1 (gain vertical space and reach the apple at (1,9)), then pivot right across the top to start hemming the enemy in.\n- Keep at least 2\u20133 exits at all times. Only force head-on when we have \u2265 their apples or can guarantee they have no escape.\n- Prioritize body placement that cuts off their horizontal lanes while keeping an escape lane for ourselves.\n\nLET\u2019S PRESS \u2014 space > risky slams.

Immediate death. NOPE. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,7) has an apple.

We should stay aggressive but safe.\n\nOption tradeoffs:\n- DOWN to (3,8): gives more center control and extra follow-up choices (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN next turn). But it also pulls us toward the opponent\u2019s approach vectors and increases chance they can herd us into a trap as they climb.\n- RIGHT to (4,9): keeps us on the top row, maintains lateral control, pressures the apple line at x\u22487, and keeps two clean follow-ups (RIGHT or DOWN) while minimizing immediate contact with the enemy. Keeps them having to come up to us \u2014 we dictate the fight.\n\nDecision / short plan:\n- Stay on the top row and press right. Sweep toward the (7,9) corridor to deny vertical space, lure the rival up, then drop down to pinch them when they commit. Keep at least two escape options every turn; don\u2019t get funneled into x=0. Be ready to force a head-on only if we get ahead on apples \u2014 not when tied.\n\nRIGHT",

Body: **(4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)**.  \nEnemy #0 head: **(5, 8)**. Body: **(4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9)**.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- **UP to (4, 8):** That's enemy's body (specifically the first segment). **DEAD ON ARRIVAL** \u2013 can't go into enemy body.  \n- **DOWN to (4, 6):** That's my own body (the segment behind my head). **BACKWARDS INTO MYSELF** \u2013 dead.  \n- **LEFT to (3, 7):** Empty. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT to (5, 7):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**MOVES TO CONSIDER: LEFT vs. RIGHT.**\n\n**EVALUATE EACH:**  \n1. **LEFT to (3, 7):**  \n   - My body follows: my head becomes (3, 7), tail leaves (2, 6).  \n   - Distance to enemy: He's at (5, 8). I'm at (3, 7). Manhattan distance: |5-3| + |8-7| = 2 + 1 = 3.  \n   - Strategic: This moves me AWAY from the vertical line, opening up the left side. Apples on left: (2, 6) is apple? No, (2, 6) was my old tail, but there's an apple at (1, 0) and (0, 7). Not immediate.  \n   - **Future options:** From (3, 7), I can go UP to (3, 8) (but enemy is at (4, 8) \u2013 not same cell, but note his body at (4, 8)). Actually, (3, 8) is empty? Check board: row 8: columns: 0 ., 1 ., 2 ., 3 ., 4 T (enemy body), 5 0 (enemy head), 6 ., 7 A, 8 A, 9 . . So (3, 8) is empty. So LEFT gives me flexibility: can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn. Good.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (5, 7):**  \n   - My head moves to (5, 7). Body follows: (5, 7) new head, old head (4,7) becomes neck, etc. Tail moves from (2,6).  \n   - Distance to enemy: He's at (5, 8). That's directly UP from (5, 7)! Manhattan distance: 1.  \n   - This puts me DIRECTLY BELOW HIM. That's aggression! If I go RIGHT, I'm at (5, 7); if he goes DOWN to (5, 7), we collide head-on. But since we're tied 3-3, a double KO is a tie \u2013 and since I'm forcing the endgame, that's acceptable? Wait, tie means draw \u2013 not a win.  \n   - But if I'm in a winning position later, I'd rather avoid tie. However, at 3-3, both at risk of dying elsewhere. Forcing a collision could end it now.  \n   - Also, RIGHT moves me CLOSER to apples on right: (7, 1), (8, 2), (9, 4) are reachable. (5, 7) has apple? No, (7, 8) is far.  \n   - Future options from (5, 7): UP to (5, 8) \u2013 that's enemy head's current position! Dangerous if he stays. LEFT to (4, 7) is my current position (but that'll be empty after move). DOWN to (5, 6) is empty. RIGHT to (6, 7) empty. So still multiple options.\n\n**STRATEGIC GOAL:** Force enemy to crash or trap him.  \n**AGGRESSION:** Since score is tied (3-3), I should force a head-on collision if I can guarantee I survive. But in head-on, both die \u2013 draw. Not a win. I want to win, not draw. So I should position to corner him without dying.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From LEFT move, I can chase him into a corner. From RIGHT move, I'm in his face, but risk collision.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:** Both LEFT and RIGHT are safe immediately.  \n**PREDICT ENEMY:** Enemy is at (5, 8). His possible moves:  \n- UP: (5, 9) \u2013 but board row 9: (5,9) is '.'? Row 9: . . . T T . . A . . \u2013 (5,9) is '.'? Wait row 9: columns: 0 '.', 1 '.', 2 '.', 3 'T' (enemy body), 4 'T' (enemy body), 5 '.', 6 '.', 7 'A', 8 '.', 9 '.' \u2013 actually (5,9) is '.' so UP is safe for him.  \n- DOWN: (5, 7) \u2013 that's where I might go RIGHT. Collision if I go RIGHT.  \n- LEFT: (4, 8) \u2013 that's his own body segment! He would die moving into his own body. So he can't go LEFT.  \n- RIGHT: (6, 8) \u2013 empty? Row 8: (6,8) is '.'? Row 8: columns 0 '.',1 '.',2 '.',3 '.',4 'T',5 '0',6 '.',7 'A',8 'A',9 '.' \u2013 (6,8) is '.' so safe.\n\nSo enemy likely goes UP or RIGHT to avoid dying. DOWN is possible but risky if I go RIGHT.\n\n**MY MOVE DECISION:**  \nIf I go RIGHT (to 5,7), and he goes UP (to 5,9) or RIGHT (to 6,8), I'm now at his location (5,7) and can chase. If he goes DOWN, we collide \u2013 double KO \u2013 tie.  \nIf I go LEFT (to 3,7), I'm safer but less aggressive. He can then go UP or RIGHT away. I'll have to chase more.\n\n**AGGRESSION MODE:** Since I'm the underdog? No, tied. But I want to force the win. I prefer to go RIGHT to pressure him directly. That's what chat wants \u2013 hype!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT to (5,7). It's the aggressive move that puts me directly below his head, ready to pounce. It maximizes psychological pressure and gives me a chance to chase him next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After moving RIGHT, if he moves UP or RIGHT, I'll continue RIGHT/UP to cut off his escape. If he moves DOWN into me, we die \u2013 but that's a draw, and since I'm forcing the end, it's fine. I'd rather win than draw, but drawing with the enemy dead is still content!\n\n**LET'S GOOOOO!** \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Manhattan distance: |6-5| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3.  \n   - Strategic: This moves me DOWN, away from enemy's vertical line. Apples nearby: (7,1), (8,2) are reachable via RIGHT. (4,2) is on left.  \n   - **Future options:** From (5, 6), I can go UP (back to (5,7)), DOWN (to (5,5)), LEFT (to (4,6) \u2013 my own body? Wait, after move, my body is at (5,7),(4,7),(4,6) \u2013 so (4,6) will be occupied. Can't go LEFT into body. RIGHT (to (6,6)) is empty. So only UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe next turn. Three options \u2013 good flexibility.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (6, 7):**  \n   - My head moves to (6, 7). Body follows: (6,7) new head, old head (5,7) becomes neck, tail leaves (3,6).  \n   - Distance to enemy: He's at (6, 8). That's directly UP from (6, 7)! Manhattan distance: 1.  \n   - This puts me DIRECTLY BELOW HIM again, but one step right. Aggression!  \n   - **Future options:** From (6, 7), I can go UP (to (6,8) \u2013 enemy head's current position! Dangerous if he stays or moves down). DOWN (to (6,6) \u2013 empty). LEFT (to (5,7) \u2013 empty after move). RIGHT (to (7,7) \u2013 empty). So four options \u2013 great flexibility.  \n   - **Apple proximity:** (7,1), (8,2), (9,4) are more accessible from here.\n\n**STRATEGIC GOAL:** Box enemy in and force a crash.  \n**AGGRESSION:** Since score is tied (3-3), I should position to corner him. RIGHT move keeps pressure high \u2013 I'm in his face. If he moves UP or LEFT, he might trap himself. If he moves RIGHT, I chase. If he moves DOWN into me? Double KO \u2013 draw. But I want to WIN. However, RIGHT gives me better chasing potential.\n\n**PREDICT ENEMY:** Enemy at (6,8). His possible moves:  \n- UP: (6,9) \u2013 board row 9: (6,9) is '.' (row 9: columns 0-2 '.', 3-4 'T', 5 '.', 6 '.', 7 'A', 8 '.', 9 '.'). Safe.  \n- DOWN: (6,7) \u2013 that's where I might go RIGHT. Collision if I go RIGHT.  \n- LEFT: (5,8) \u2013 that's his own body segment! He would die moving into his own body. So he can't go LEFT.  \n- RIGHT: (7,8) \u2013 board: (7,8) is 'A' (apple). Safe and he gets +1 apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7) and he goes RIGHT to (7,8), I'm at (6,7) and can chase him to (7,8) next turn (but he'll be gone). If he goes UP to (6,9), I can follow. If he goes DOWN to (6,7), we collide \u2013 double KO. So RIGHT keeps options open.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:** RIGHT is safe immediately. DOWN is also safe, but less aggressive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From RIGHT move, I can chase enemy into the top-right corner. If he goes to (7,8), I move to (7,8) next turn (but he'll move away). I need to cut off his escape routes. Use apples to grow and dominate space.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT to (6,7). It's aggressive, keeps me close to enemy, and maximizes future chasing options. Chat loves pressure \u2013 let's make him sweat!\n\n**LET'S GOOOOO!** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",

Body: **[(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6)]** (after last move RIGHT, I grew because I ate an apple at (6,7)? Wait, looking at the board: at turn 17, I moved RIGHT from (5,7) to (6,7). The board shows (6,7) was '1' (my head) and (7,8) was '0' (enemy head). I don't see an apple at (6,7) in the list? Actually apple list: (7,1), (8,2), (9,4) etc. But I grew? Scoreboard says my apples: 3. Last turn I ate nothing? Wait, maybe the apple was hidden? Actually board shows 'A' at (6,7) in turn 17 board? Let's check: In last turn's board, (6,7) was 'A'? The board given: Row 7: \"A . . . T T 1 . . .\" (columns 0-9). At column 6 (x=6), it's '1' (my head). At column 7 (x=7), it's '.' (empty). So no apple at (6,7). So I didn't grow. So my body should be: new head (6,7), old head (5,7), then (4,7), (4,6), tail (4,6)? Wait tail was (4,6) originally, but after moving, tail moves? Let's compute: From last turn: my head (5,7), body [(5,7),(4,7),(4,6)]? Actually the body list from last turn: [(5,7), (4,7), (4,6)] with head (6,7)? No, the description says: \"My head is at (5,7). Body: [(5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]\" but that's inconsistent because the head is included in the body list? Actually in Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail. So for my snake, the list is: head (6,7), then (5,7), then (4,7), then (4,6). So the body includes the head. So after move RIGHT, new head (6,7), and body becomes [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]? But wait, tail (4,6) stays if I didn't eat. Actually snake grows only if eat apple. So without apple, the tail moves forward (the last segment disappears). So original body before move: head (5,7), body [(5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]? That's confusing because the head is part of the body list. Let's reinterpret: The snake list is head-to-tail. So at turn 17 start: my snake: head (6,7) ??? Wait the board at turn 18 shows my head at (6,7) and body: (5,7), (4,7), (4,6). That means the list is: [ (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (4,6) ]? But that's 4 segments. Apples collected: 3. So length 4. That matches. So at turn 17, I moved RIGHT from (5,7) to (6,7). I did NOT eat an apple. So the tail (which was somewhere) should have moved forward. The previous tail at turn 17 start was (4,6)? Actually at turn 17 start, my head was (5,7), body [(5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]? That would be 3 segments? But apples: 3, so length 4. So maybe the list included the head? Actually the description: \"My head is at (5,7). Body: [(5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]\" That seems like the head is listed as part of the body? But the format says \"head: (6,7), Body: [(5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]\" So body excludes the head. So at turn 17 start: head (5,7), body (5,7)? No, that's weird. Let's look at turn 18 board: my snake is at (6,7) head, and body cells: (5,7), (4,7), (4,6). So the body list is those three. So at turn 17, I moved from (5,7) to (6,7). The old head (5,7) becomes part of body, and the tail (4,6) moves? Actually the previous body at turn 17 start was [(4,7), (4,6), (3,6)]? From last rationale: \"My head is at (5,7). Body: [(5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]\" That's contradictory. I think the body list in the description includes the head as the first element? But it says \"Body: [(5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]\" and head separately (5,7). So maybe body list includes head? That would be wrong. Let's ignore the confusion and use the current board: my head (6,7), body cells (5,7), (4,7), (4,6). That's 4 segments total. So I am length 4.\n\nEnemy #0: head (7,8), body [(6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (4,9)], apples 4, length 5.\n\n**MY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (6,7):**  \n- UP to (6,8): That's enemy's body (the first segment behind his head). DEAD.  \n- DOWN to (6,6): Empty (board shows '.' at (6,6) in row 6). Safe.  \n- LEFT to (5,7): Empty (my body moved? Actually (5,7) is currently my body cell, but after I move, my body will shift. When I move, my head leaves (6,7), new head goes to (5,7), but (5,7) is currently occupied by my own body? That would be moving into my own body. That's a collision. So LEFT is unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (7,7): Empty (board shows '.' at (7,7) in row 7). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**EVALUATE EACH:**\n\n1. **DOWN to (6,6):**  \n   - Move to (6,6). Manhattan distance to enemy head (7,8): |7-6|+|8-6|=1+2=3.  \n   - Future options: From (6,6), possible moves:  \n     * UP: back to (6,7) \u2013 empty after move? (6,7) becomes my neck, so it's occupied by my body? Actually after moving down, my body will be: new head (6,6), then old head (6,7), then (5,7), then (4,7). So (6,7) is occupied. So UP is into my own body -> dead.  \n     * DOWN: (6,5) \u2013 empty (row 5, col 6 is '.'). Safe.  \n     * LEFT: (5,6) \u2013 empty? Board shows '.' at (5,6) in row 6? Row 6: \". . . . T . . . . .\" so (5,6) is column 5 row 6: 'T'? Wait row 6: \" . . . . T . . . . .\" columns 0-9: 0 '.',1 '.',2 '.',3 '.',4 'T',5 '.',6 '.',7 '.',8 '.',9 '.'. So (5,6) is column 5 row 6: '.' (since column 5 is after T at column 4). Actually T is at (4,6). So (5,6) is '.'. Safe.  \n     * RIGHT: (7,6) \u2013 empty? Row 6 column 7: '.' safe.  \n   So from (6,6), I'd have 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). UP is unsafe into my own body. That's okay but not great.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (7,7):**  \n   - Move to (7,7). Manhattan to enemy: |7-7|+|8-7|=0+1=1. Very close!  \n   - Future options: From (7,7):  \n     * UP to (7,8): That's enemy head's current position. If enemy moves away, it's empty. But if enemy stays, collision. Dangerous.  \n     * DOWN to (7,6): Empty (row 6 col 7 '.'). Safe.  \n     * LEFT to (6,7): That's my old head position, which will become my body segment after move. So moving LEFT would go into my own body? Actually after moving to (7,7), my body will be: new head (7,7), old head (6,7), then (5,7), (4,7). So (6,7) is occupied. So LEFT is into my own body -> dead.  \n     * RIGHT to (8,7): Empty? Row 7 col 8: '.'? Row 7: \"A . . . T T 1 . . .\" so col 8 is '.' (after 1 at col 7? Wait row 7: col0 'A', col1 '.', col2 '.', col3 '.', col4 'T', col5 'T', col6 '1', col7 '.', col8 '.', col9 '.'? Actually the string: \"A . . . T T 1 . . .\" that's 10 characters? Let's count: A, ., ., ., T, T, 1, ., ., . -> 10. So col8 is '.' (the 9th character? indices 0-9). So (8,7) is '.' safe.  \n   So from (7,7), I'd have 2 safe moves (DOWN and RIGHT). UP and LEFT are dangerous. That's fewer options.\n\n**STRATEGIC GOAL:** Box enemy in and force a crash. Score is 3-4, I'm behind. I need to get apples but also pressure enemy.\n\n**PREDICT ENEMY:** Enemy at (7,8). Possible moves:  \n- UP to (7,9): Row 9 col7 is 'A' (apple). He might go there to eat. Safe.  \n- DOWN to (7,7): That's where I might go RIGHT. If I go RIGHT and he goes DOWN, we both go to (7,7) -> head-on collision -> both die. But I have fewer apples (3 vs 4), so if we both die, he wins because he has more apples. That's bad.  \n- LEFT to (6,8): That's his own body? Actually his body is (6,8) as first segment behind head. So moving LEFT into his own body would kill him. He won't do that.  \n- RIGHT to (8,8): Row 8 col8 is 'A'? Board row 8: \". . . . T T T 0 A .\" so col8 is 'A' (apple). He might go there. Safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6,6), I'm safe and away from immediate collision. If he goes DOWN to (7,7), that's empty? Actually if I go DOWN, (7,7) remains empty. He could go DOWN to (7,7) and eat an apple? No apple at (7,7). But he might not.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7), I risk him going DOWN to (7,7) and we both die -> he wins. But maybe he goes UP or RIGHT. If he goes UP to (7,9) or RIGHT to (8,8), I can chase.\n\n**AGGRESSION:** Since I'm behind, I need to take risks to get apples. The apple at (8,8) is close. From (7,7), I can go RIGHT to (8,7) then UP to (8,8) or something. But RIGHT move puts me in danger.\n\n**SAFETY FIRST:** Let's check apples: There's an apple at (8,2), (9,4), (7,9), (0,3), etc. But I need to grow.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (6,6) DOWN move, I can go LEFT to (5,6) then maybe down to (5,5) etc. There's an apple at (4,2) and (3,0). But enemy is in top-right. I should maybe try to cut him off from the bottom.\n\n**DECISION:** I think DOWN is safer and gives me more options. I don't want to risk a head-on collision where I lose because of lower score. Let's play it safe for now and look for opportunities.\n\n**CHOOSING DOWN.**\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT!** \ud83d\udd25",

Body: [(6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7)] (4 segments total). Enemy #0 at head (8, 8), body [(7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9)] (5 segments). I'm still behind 3-4 apples.\n\n**ENEMY THREAT:** The enemy is at (8,8) with a clear path to many apples. He could be lining up for a big growth spurt. My mission is to cut him off and force a head-on collision where I win with a higher score. But I need to get more apples FIRST.\n\n**BOARD OBSERVATION:** There's an apple at (8,2) and (9,4) in the bottom-right quadrant. The enemy is in the top-right. I should head DOWN and LEFT to dominate the lower half and starve him out.\n\n**MY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (6,6):**\n- **UP to (6,7):** That's my own body (the cell right behind my head). Moving UP would be moving backwards into myself - INSTANT DEATH. NO!\n- **DOWN to (6,5):** Board shows '.' at (6,5). Safe. This moves me away from the enemy and towards the lower apples.\n- **LEFT to (5,6):** Board shows '.' at (5,6). Safe. Moves me left and away from the enemy cluster.\n- **RIGHT to (7,6):** Board shows '.' at (7,6). Safe, but brings me closer to enemy territory.\n\n**EVALUATION:**\n- **UP:** DEAD (backwards into self). ELIMINATED.\n- **DOWN:** Safe. From (6,5), I have options: DOWN to (6,4), LEFT to (5,5), RIGHT to (7,5). Moves me toward apple at (4,2) and (3,0). This is my ZONE. I want to control the bottom.\n- **LEFT:** Safe. From (5,6), I could go DOWN to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6) (which has a 'T' - not an apple, just a marker), or UP to (5,7) (which will be my body). LEFT might lead me into the middle.\n- **RIGHT:** Safe, but risky. From (7,6), I'm even closer to the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN from (8,8) to (8,7) or (7,8) to (7,7), we could be dangerously close. Also, my options from (7,6) are more limited (UP to (7,7) which will be empty, DOWN to (7,5), LEFT to (6,6) my body after move, RIGHT to (8,6)). But RIGHT puts me in the enemy's neighborhood where he has 5 segments controlling that region.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:** I need to expand my territory and get apples. The apple at (4,2) and (3,0) are my immediate targets. Moving DOWN gives me the best access to those while putting more distance between me and the enemy. Also, moving DOWN keeps me away from the immediate collision risk with the enemy who might be moving towards the apples at (8,8) or (7,9).\n\n**PREDICT ENEMY:** With apples at (8,8) and (7,9), the enemy might go RIGHT to (9,8) or UP to (8,9). He might even chase the apple at (9,4) but that's far. He's likely to stay in his top-right zone for now.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Go DOWN to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), then LEFT toward (4,2) or (3,0). Grab apples, grow to 4-5. Then plan to cut off the enemy's escape routes by controlling the center and bottom. Eventually, force him into a corner where he has to crash into me. With equal or higher apples, head-on collision is mine.\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT! WE'RE HEADING DOWN TO CLAIM OUR DOMAIN!** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\nDOWN",

Body: [(6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7)] (4 segments total). Enemy #0 at head (8, 7), body [(8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8)] (5 segments). I'm behind 3-5 apples. CRITICAL TURN - If I score an apple this turn and he doesn't, I close the gap. But if we both score, the gap remains.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n1. **Enemy head at (8,7)** - This is 2 cells away from my head (6,5). The Manhattan distance is |6-8| + |5-7| = 4. He could move DOWN to (8,6) or LEFT to (7,7) - both bring him closer.\n2. **Apple at (7,4)** is right near me! And apple at (4,2) is my target.\n3. **Enemy body wall** at (6,8), (5,8), etc. creates a barrier I must respect.\n\n**MY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (6,5):**\n- **UP to (6,6):** That's my body! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (6,4):** Board shows '.' at (6,4). Safe. Moves toward (6,3) and eventually to apple at (4,2).\n- **LEFT to (5,5):** Board shows '.' at (5,5). Safe. Moves toward (4,5) and down to apple at (4,2).\n- **RIGHT to (7,5):** Board shows 'A' at (7,4) nearby, but (7,5) is '.' Safe. However, this puts me closer to enemy territory.\n\n**EVALUATION:**\n- **UP:** DEAD (backwards into self). NO.\n- **DOWN:** Safe. From (6,4), I have options: DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,4), RIGHT to (7,4). The apple at (7,4) is RIGHT there! If I go DOWN now, next turn I could move RIGHT to (7,4) and eat that apple!\n- **LEFT:** Safe. From (5,5), options: DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5), UP to (5,6) (empty). Moves me toward (4,2) but slower.\n- **RIGHT:** Safe but risky. From (7,5), I'm closer to enemy. Could move DOWN to (7,4) THIS TURN and eat the apple! But if enemy moves LEFT to (7,7) or DOWN to (8,6), we could be in danger zone.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:** \nI need to force the issue! The apple at (7,4) is ACTUALLY reachable THIS TURN if I go RIGHT. But is it safe? Let's simulate:\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,5): Enemy at (8,7) could move LEFT to (7,7) (safe), DOWN to (8,6) (safe), or UP to (8,8) (occupied by his own body). Most likely he moves DOWN to chase the apple at (9,4) or LEFT to expand.\n- If I go DOWN to (6,4): I'm setting up for a guaranteed apple next turn at (7,4) via RIGHT. But what if the enemy sees it and moves there first? Enemy could move DOWN to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) or something... unlikely to grab (7,4) immediately.\n\n**PREDICT ENEMY:** With apples at (9,4) and (7,9), enemy likely moves DOWN to (8,6) to head toward (9,4) or RIGHT to (9,7) to explore. He's not in position to grab (7,4) this turn.\n\n**BEST PLAY:** Go DOWN to (6,4) to position for the apple at (7,4) next turn. This keeps me safe, maintains distance from enemy, and sets up a guaranteed point next turn. If I rush RIGHT to (7,5) now, I might get the apple next turn, but I'm putting myself in a more exposed position with fewer escape routes.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Grab (7,4) next turn \u2192 grow to 4 segments \u2192 head toward (4,2) and (3,0) to dominate bottom half. Keep enemy in top-right corner. When I have 5+ apples, force head-on collision where I win. \n\n**LET'S GO CHAT! WE'RE POSITIONING FOR THE COMEBACK!** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Opponent #0 is at head (8, 6), body [(8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8)]. Score: I'm 3-5. I need to close the gap.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n1. **Apple at (7, 4):** It's RIGHT there. If I move RIGHT to (7, 4), I eat it and grow to 4 segments. This is huge for morale and positioning.\n2. **Opponent Movement:** Opponent is at (8, 6). They can move DOWN to (8, 5) (apple there!), LEFT to (7, 6), or UP to (8, 7) (occupied by their own body). They will likely chase the apple at (8, 5) or (9, 4). This keeps them occupied in the top-right.\n3. **My Safety:** From (6, 4), I can move UP (6, 5 - my body, DEAD), DOWN (6, 3 - empty), LEFT (5, 4 - empty), or RIGHT (7, 4 - apple).\n\n**EVALUATION OF MOVES:**\n*   **UP:** Into my own body (6, 5). Dead instantly. \u274c\n*   **DOWN:** To (6, 3). Safe. But I miss the apple at (7, 4). I'd be moving away from the immediate point opportunity.\n*   **LEFT:** To (5, 4). Safe. But I miss the apple at (7, 4). I'd be moving away from the immediate point opportunity.\n*   **RIGHT:** To (7, 4). This is an **APPLE**. Eating it gives me +1 point (4 total) and I grow. The space is empty. The opponent is far away (distance 2+ from this square).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe apple at (7, 4) is free real estate. The opponent is distracted in the top-right chasing their own snacks. Taking this apple immediately closes the score gap to 4-5 and sets me up with a longer body for blocking later. I need to be aggressive. I can't let the opponent get too far ahead. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (7, 4) now. Next turn, I'll be at (7, 4) with body extending back. I need to secure the bottom-left apples ((3, 0), (4, 0), (1, 0), (0, 3)) to dominate the board and cut off opponent expansion. If I can trap them in the top-right, I win by starvation or forced collision.\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT! GRAB THE SNACK!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

If the enemy guesses RIGHT (to 8,4) we get a head\u2011on double KO \u2014 which still wins because we\u2019re up 6 \u2192 4. But if they dodge, we lose immediate pressure and drift toward fewer aggressive options. \ud83c\udfaf/\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,5): legal AND aggressively places our head directly above the enemy head at (7,4). This forces them into tough choices: go UP into a head\u2011on (double KO \u2192 we win thanks to +2 apple lead), or escape sideways/down into tighter real estate near their own body. LEFT keeps multiple follow-up exits (up to 7,6, down to 7,4 if they vacate, etc.) and is the most proactive pressure move. \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udca5\n\nEnemy checks (head 7,4; neck 6,4):\n- Their legal moves: RIGHT \u2192 (8,4), UP \u2192 (7,5), DOWN \u2192 (7,3).\n- By moving LEFT to (7,5) we directly contest their UP option and maximize chances of forcing a head\u2011on. We want that \u2014 we\u2019re ahead on apples, so forcing risky head collisions is good play. Do we care about apples right now? Not as much \u2014 domination and forcing errors is the play. \ud83c\udf4e\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Stick on their flank, deny easy space to the right, and bait them into moving into our head or into their own cramped column at x=6. If they bite up into us, we take the double KO win (apples favor us). If they sidestep, we follow and box them against their body column. Be aggressive, stay one step from their head, and don\u2019t hug the wall.\n\nFinal read: LEFT is the aggressive, score\u2011advantaged play that forces a decision and keeps multiple follow-ups.

The opponent (#0) is at (8, 5). Score is 6-4. I'm trailing, but I'm growing. I need to keep the pressure on.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n1. **Opponent Head:** He's at (8, 5). He can move DOWN to (8, 4) (empty), LEFT to (7, 5) (empty), or UP to (8, 6) (his own body). He's likely going DOWN or LEFT to chase apples or avoid self-collision.\n2. **My Safety:** From (7, 4), I can move:\n    *   **UP:** (7, 5) - Empty.\n    *   **DOWN:** (7, 3) - Empty.\n    *   **LEFT:** (6, 4) - This is my *tail* from the previous turn. My body will move forward, making this empty *before* I move into it? No, simultaneous movement means my body moves *at the same time*. If I move LEFT, my head goes to (6, 4). At the same time, my tail (currently at (6, 7)) moves to (6, 6), and the segment at (6, 4) moves to (6, 5)? Wait.\n    *   Let's check my body: Head (7, 4). Body: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7)].\n    *   If I move LEFT to (6, 4): (6, 4) is currently my body. BUT, the entire body shifts. My old body segment at (6, 4) becomes part of the new body (specifically, the segment *behind* the head).\n    *   Actually, the tail leaves (6, 7). The segment at (6, 6) moves to (6, 7). The segment at (6, 5) moves to (6, 6). The segment at (6, 4) moves to (6, 5).\n    *   So, if I move LEFT to (6, 4), the cell (6, 4) becomes the *new head*. The old body segment at (6, 4) shifts to (6, 5).\n    *   Wait, that means the space (6, 4) is occupied by my *current* body. However, in simultaneous movement, the tail moves away first (technically).\n    *   Actually, let's look at the rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n    *   Does \"own body\" include the tail that is moving away? Usually yes. But often in these games, if the tail moves away, the space is free.\n    *   Let's look at the board state. My body is a vertical line at (6,4) to (6,7).\n    *   Moving LEFT to (6, 4) is moving into my own body segment.\n    *   However, because I am moving into the space where my tail is currently sitting? No, my tail is at (6, 7).\n    *   The segment at (6, 4) is immediately connected to my head. If I move left, I am effectively turning 180 degrees?\n    *   Wait. My head is at (7, 4). My body starts at (6, 4).\n    *   Moving LEFT goes to (6, 4). (6, 4) is currently occupied by my body.\n    *   *However*, if I do NOT eat an apple, my tail moves forward.\n    *   Current tail is (6, 7).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (6, 4):\n        *   Head goes to (6, 4).\n        *   The segment at (6, 4) moves to (6, 5).\n        *   The segment at (6, 5) moves to (6, 6).\n        *   The segment at (6, 6) moves to (6, 7).\n        *   The segment at (6, 7) moves to... nowhere (it disappears).\n    *   So, the cell (6, 4) is vacated by the body segment moving to (6, 5)? No, the head moves *into* (6, 4) at the same time the body segment *leaves* (6, 4) to go to (6, 5).\n    *   In standard Snake rules, moving into the space where your tail *just was* is valid (the tail moves away). Moving into a body segment that is *not* the tail is death.\n    *   Here, (6, 4) is the *neck*. It is not the tail.\n    *   Therefore, moving LEFT into (6, 4) is hitting my own body (the neck). **DEATH.**\n    *   Wait, let's double check. Head at (7,4). Neck at (6,4).\n    *   Moving Left -> (6,4). Neck is there. I die.\n    *   Unless... do I grow? No apple eaten last turn (I ate (7,4) this turn? No, the replay says I moved RIGHT to (7,4) in turn 21. So I ate the apple at (7,4) in turn 21. My length increased. My tail didn't move in turn 21.\n    *   Wait. The replay says \"My head is at (6, 4)\" in Turn 21 analysis. Then I moved RIGHT to (7,4).\n    *   So in Turn 22, my head is at (7,4). My body is [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)].\n    *   I did NOT eat an apple in the immediate past (Turn 21 move result is unknown, but I *targeted* an apple).\n    *   If I ate an apple in Turn 21 (at 7,4), my tail would not move in Turn 22.\n    *   Let's assume I successfully ate the apple at (7,4) in Turn 21 (since the move was RIGHT to 7,4).\n    *   If I ate the apple, my length increases. The tail stays put.\n    *   Current State for Turn 22:\n        *   Head: (7,4)\n        *   Body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n        *   Length: 5 segments.\n    *   If I ate, the tail (6,7) stays.\n    *   If I did NOT eat (maybe I missed?), the tail moves.\n    *   Let's look at the Board State provided in the prompt.\n    *   Board 9: ...\n    *   Board 8: ...

That kills me.\n                *   So if I go RIGHT to (8,4), I am trapped below him.\n                *   I can go LEFT (7,4), DOWN (8,3), or RIGHT (9,4 - blocked by him).\n                *   This seems like a box *for me*.\n                *   So moving RIGHT is bad if he takes the apple.\n            *   What if he doesn't take the apple?\n            *   If he moves DOWN to (8,4), we collide. I die.\n            *   If he moves LEFT to (7,5), I am at (8,4). He is at (7,5).\n            *   I can move UP to (8,5) (his tail) or LEFT to (7,4).\n            *   This is less restrictive.\n            *   **Conclusion on RIGHT:** High risk of trapping myself or dying.\n            *   **Conclusion on UP:** High risk of collision if he moves LEFT.\n            *   **Conclusion on DOWN:** Safe. Secures food.\n            *   **Wait, let's look at the board again.**\n            *   The opponent has a very long body (6 segments + head = length 7).\n            *   He is constrained by his own body in the top-right.\n            *   I am at (7,4). My body is at x=6.\n            *   If I move DOWN to (7,3), I am moving into the \"middle\" of the board but lower.\n            *   The apples at (4,2), (3,3) are there.\n            *   The apple at (7,1) is there.\n            *   If I go DOWN, I can eat (7,1) in two turns.\n            *   Meanwhile, the opponent is chasing (9,4) and (8,2).\n            *   If I secure the bottom, I can eventually cut off the top-right.\n            *   The opponent is long. He turns slowly.\n            *   I should avoid the immediate conflict since I am smaller (4 vs 6).\n            *   I need to grow.\n            *   The apple at (7,1) is the easiest target.\n            *   **Move: DOWN.**\n            *   Why not LEFT? (6,4) is blocked by my body.\n            *   Why not UP? (7,5) is dangerous proximity to enemy.\n            *   Why not RIGHT? (8,4) is dangerous proximity and traps me.\n            *   DOWN is the only logical safe move to grow.\n            *   However, I need to be aggressive.\n            *   \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score. Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n            *   I have a *lower* score. I should NOT force a collision.\n            *   So aggression means controlling space and eating apples, not suicide colliding.\n            *   Moving DOWN allows me to eat and grow. Once I have a higher score (or equal), I can force collisions.\n\n            *   **Let's double check the LEFT move.**\n            *   Head (7,4). Body (6,4)...\n            *   If I move LEFT to (6,4).\n            *   The segment at (6,4) is my neck.\n            *   I move into it. **DEAD.**\n            *   Correct.\n\n            *   **Let's double check UP vs DOWN.**\n            *   UP (7,5). Enemy (8,5).\n            *   If enemy moves LEFT (7,5) -> Collision. Enemy wins (6>4).\n            *   Is he likely to move LEFT?\n            *   He has an apple at (9,4). He has space at (7,5).\n            *   Moving LEFT commits him to the left side.\n            *   Moving RIGHT commits him to the right side (and apple).\n            *   He is an \"archrival\". He wants to kill me.\n            *   If he sees me at (7,4), and I move UP to (7,5), he sees a chance to kill me if he moves LEFT.\n            *   But he doesn't know my move.\n            *   If he moves RIGHT, he gets an apple.\n            *   If he moves LEFT, he gets no apple but might kill me.\n            *   Killing me guarantees his win (I have 4 apples, he has 6).\n            *   So, as an archrival, he might prefer to kill me over getting an apple.\n            *   Therefore, if I move UP (getting closer), I increase the chance he tries to kill me (by moving LEFT).\n            *   If I move DOWN, I am further away. He can't kill me this turn.\n            *   So DOWN is safer against an aggressive enemy.\n\n            *   **Final check on RIGHT.**\n            *   If I move RIGHT to (8,4).\n            *   I am stepping into his \"home\".\n            *   He is at (8,5).\n            *   If he moves DOWN, he kills me (and risks his own life if I moved there, but he wins on tie-breaker score).\n            *   Since he is the archrival and winning, he is likely to play it safe or take a guaranteed apple.\n            *   But if he sees me invading, he might strike.\n            *   Moving to (8,4) is an invasion.\n            *   Moving to (7,3) is a retreat to secure resources.\n            *   Given the score disadvantage, securing resources (DOWN) seems the best path to a comeback.\n\n            *   **Wait!** Look at the apple list again.\n            *   (7, 1) is an apple.\n            *   (4, 2) is an apple.\n            *   (3, 3) is an apple.\n            *   (1, 0) is an apple.\n            *   There is a cluster in the bottom-left.\n            *   The opponent has (9, 4), (8, 2), (7, 9).\n            *   He is in the top-right.\n            *   If I go DOWN, I claim the bottom-left.\n            *   I will grow faster because there are more accessible apples for me (clustering) than for him (scattered in the corner).\n            *   So, **DOWN** is the strategic play.\n\n            *   **One alternative:** What if I move LEFT? No, death.\n            *   What if I move UP? Risky collision.\n            *   What if I move RIGHT? Risky collision/trap.\n\n            *   **Decision:** Move DOWN to (7,3).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI am behind in score (4 vs 6). Engaging the enemy head-on now is suicide because I lose on tie-breaker. I need to grow. The bottom-left quadrant has a dense cluster of apples ((7,1), (4,2), (3,3), (1,0)). By moving DOWN, I secure this territory and start chaining eats. The opponent is stuck in the top-right. Let him have (9,4). I'll take the swarm. This sets me up to cut him off later when I'm larger.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1.  Move DOWN to (7,3).\n2.  Next turn, move to (7,2) or (6,3) to approach the apple at (7,1).\n3.  Chain apples in the bottom-left to grow to length 6+.\n4.  Once I have a lead or equal size, push up to cut off the opponent's escape routes at x=5 or x=6.\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT!

He moved UP last turn (from 7, 5 to 7, 6? No, wait. Opponent head is at (7, 5) *now*. In the \"Last Move\" section, it said he was at (8, 5) on Turn 22. So he moved LEFT from (8, 5) to (7, 5). We are currently in a vertical line facing each other! My head at (7, 3), his at (7, 5). There is a gap of one cell between us at (7, 4).\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n1.  **The Gap:** We are separated by exactly one cell ((7, 4)).\n2.  **Opponent's Options:**\n    *   **UP:** (7, 6) - Occupied by his own body (Tail is at (7, 6)? No, his body is [(8,5), (8,6)...]. Wait, let's re-read his body.\n    *   *Opponent Body:* [(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)].\n    *   Wait, the board shows 'T' at (7, 6) and (7, 7) in the visual, but the text list says otherwise.\n    *   *Visual Check:* Row 6 shows \"... T . T .\" (Col 5 is T, Col 7 is T).\n    *   *Visual Check:* Row 7 shows \"... . T .\" (Col 7 is T).\n    *   There seems to be a discrepancy between the text body list and the visual board. The visual board is the ultimate source of truth for current positions.\n    *   *Visual Board:*\n        *   (7, 5): '0' (Opponent Head)\n        *   (7, 6): 'T' (Opponent Body)\n        *   (7, 7): 'T' (Opponent Body)\n        *   (7, 8): 'T' (Opponent Body)\n    *   This means the opponent is vertically aligned with me. He is at (7, 5). He cannot move UP because (7, 6) is his body.\n    *   He **MUST** move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n3.  **My Options from (7, 3):**\n    *   **UP (7, 4):** Moves into the gap. Directly towards the opponent.\n        *   If opponent moves DOWN (to 7, 4), we collide. **DRAW** (Death).\n        *   If opponent moves LEFT (to 6, 5) or RIGHT (to 8, 5), we don't collide.\n        *   Is (7, 4) safe? Yes, currently empty.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 2):** Moves away from opponent. (7, 2) is empty (Visual check: Row 2, Col 7 is '.').\n    *   **LEFT (6, 3):** Moves away. (6, 3) is empty.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 3):** Moves away. (8, 3) is empty.\n\n**STRATEGY & PREDICTION:**\nThe opponent is trapped vertically. He has 3 body segments immediately below him blocking the DOWN path? No, visual check:\nRow 5: ... . . . A . . . 0 . . . (Wait, let's map the board again carefully).\nRow 5 (y=5): ` . . . . A . . 0 T . .`? No, the prompt board shows:\n`5 . . . . A . T 0 T .`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nSo:\ny=5: x0='.', x1='.', x2='.', x3='.', x4='A', x5='.', x6='T', x7='0', x8='T', x9='.'\n*Correction:* Wait, looking at the text \"Opponents: Snake #0 - Head: (7, 5)\".\nVisual Board y=5: `5 . . . . A . T 0 T .`\nThis implies: x6='T', x7='0', x8='T'.\nSo the opponent is at (7, 5). His body is at (6, 5) and (8, 5).\nWait, the text body list says: `[(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)]`.\nThere is a massive conflict between the visual board and the text body list.\nVisual says (6,5) is T.\nText says (8,5) is Head (previous turn) -> moved to (7,5).\nText says body starts at (8,5) (old head) -> moves to (8,6).\nWait, if text says Head was (8,5) and is now (7,5), then the body list is outdated by one turn relative to the head position.\nBut the text says: \"Snake #0 - Head: (7, 5), Body: [(8, 5), ...]\"\nSo the body is *behind* the head.\nIf Head is (7,5), then (8,5) is the neck.\nThis matches the visual board (x=8, y=5 is 'T').\nSo the visual board is correct.\nThe opponent is at (7,5).\nHis body is at (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8).\nWait, visual board y=6: `6 . . . . . . T . T .`\nx=6 is T, x=8 is T.\nVisual board y=7: `7 A A . . . . . . T .`\nx=8 is T.\nVisual board y=8: `8 . . . . . . T T T .`\nx=6, 7, 8 are T.\n\n**Analysis of Opponent's Movement:**\n*   **UP (7, 6):** Blocked by his body (Visual T at 7,6? No, Visual T at 7,8).\n    *   Wait, Visual y=6 shows T at x=6 and x=8.\n    *   Visual y=7 shows T at x=8.\n    *   Visual y=8 shows T at x=6, 7, 8.\n    *   So (7,6) is empty ('.').\n    *   Is (7,6) part of his body? No.\n    *   Is (7,6) occupied? No.\n    *   So he CAN move UP to (7,6).\n*   **DOWN (7, 4):** Empty.\n*   **LEFT (6, 5):** Empty.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 5):** Occupied by his own body (Neck). He CANNOT move RIGHT.\n\n**My Move Selection:**\nI am at (7, 3).\n*   **UP (7, 4):** Moves towards the opponent.\n    *   If he moves DOWN (7, 4): Collision. I die (he has 6 apples, I have 4). **BAD**.\n    *   If he moves UP (7, 6): Safe.\n    *   If he moves LEFT (6, 5): Safe.\n*   **DOWN (7, 2):** Safe. Moves away.\n*   **LEFT (6, 3):** Safe. Moves away.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 3):** Safe. Moves away.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am trailing 4 vs 6. I cannot afford a collision where I lose (tie goes against me).\nMoving UP (7, 4) is risky. If he moves DOWN, I lose. He is the \"archrival\" and aggressive. He might push to cut me off.\nHowever, look at the apples.\nThere is an apple at (7, 1).\nThere is an apple at (8, 2).\nThere is an apple at (4, 2).\nThere is an apple at (4, 0).\nThere is an apple at (1, 0).\nThe bottom left is rich.\nThe opponent is in the top right (mostly).\nBy moving DOWN, I secure the bottom territory.\nIf I move UP, I engage in a coin flip.\nIf I move LEFT or RIGHT, I am moving sideways.\nGiven the score deficit, I need a guaranteed growth path.\n(7, 2) is empty.\nFrom (7, 2), I can go to (7, 1) [Apple].\nFrom (7, 2), I can go to (8, 2) [Apple].\nFrom (7, 2), I can go to (6, 2).\nThis is a high-value node.\nIf I stay at (7, 3), my only safe move away from the opponent is DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 2), I open up the bottom.\nIs there any way the opponent can cut me off? He is at y=5. I am at y=3.\nHe is slower (longer body? No, same length? He has 6 apples, I have 4. He is length 7, I am length 5).\nWait, length matters for turning circle.\nHe is longer. I am shorter. I am more agile.\nI can turn tighter.\nBut I need apples.\nThe apple at (7,1) is very close.\nLet's look at the board again.\ny=2: ` . . A . A . . . A .`\nx=2 is A, x=4 is A, x=8 is A.\ny=1: ` . . . A . . . A . .`\nx=3 is A, x=7 is A.\ny=0: ` . A . A A . . . . .`\nx=1, 3, 4 are A.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,2):\nNext turn I can grab (7,1) or (8,2).\nThis seems like the best play to equalize the score.\n\nIs there a trap?\nIf I move DOWN:\nOpponent is at (7,5).\nHe can move DOWN to (7,4).\nHe can move UP to (7,6).\nHe can move LEFT to (6,5).\nIf he moves DOWN to (7,4), he blocks my path up. That's fine. I'm going down.\nIf he moves LEFT, he heads towards the center.\nIf he moves UP, he goes back to the top.\nMy plan: Secure the bottom apples.\n\n**Wait, check safety of (7,2).**\nIs (7,2) blocked by anything?\nVisual Board y=2: `2 . . A . A . . . A .`\nx=7 is '.'.\nSo (7,2) is empty.\nIs there any other snake there? No.\nSo (7,2) is safe.\n\n**Comparison of moves:**\n1.  **DOWN (7,2):** Safe. Moves towards cluster of apples (7,1), (8,2), (4,2). Keeps me away from the opponent (currently at 7,5). Low risk.\n2.  **UP (7,4):** Risky. Towards opponent. Potential head-on collision.\n3.  **LEFT (6,3):** Safe. Moves towards (4,2) and (3,3) but (7,1) is closer if I go DOWN first.\n4.  **RIGHT (8,3):** Safe. Moves towards (8,2) and (9,4). (9,4) is far. (8,2) is close. But (7,2) is a better central pivot.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe opponent is strong (6 apples). I need to play safe and efficient. The bottom cluster is my win condition. I will move DOWN to start the harvest.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Move DOWN to (7, 2).\n2. Next turn, target (7, 1) or (8, 2).\n3. Chain the bottom left apples.\n\nLet's GOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

The opponent is at (7, 5).\n**THE GAP:** We are currently separated by two cells: (7, 4) and (7, 5) is the enemy head? No, enemy head is at (7, 5).\nWait, looking at the board state:\nMy head: (7, 2)\nOpponent head: (7, 5)\nCells between us: (7, 3) [My old body], (7, 4) [Empty].\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n1.  **Head-on Collision:**\n    *   If I move **UP** to (7, 3): I move towards him.\n    *   If he moves **DOWN** to (7, 4): We are 1 cell apart.\n    *   If I move UP *again* (hypothetical future) to (7, 4) and he moves DOWN to (7, 3), we cross paths? No, simultaneous movement.\n    *   **THIS TURN:**\n        *   My UP (7, 3) vs His DOWN (7, 4): Safe.\n        *   My UP (7, 3) vs His DOWN (7, 4): No collision.\n    *   **RISK:** Moving UP brings me closer to the enemy. If I continue UP next turn to (7, 4) and he continues DOWN to (7, 3), we swap spots. If I go to (7, 4) and he goes to (7, 4), we die.\n    *   **OPPONENT PATHING:** He is at (7, 5). His body is at (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8) (Visual check: Row 6 has T at 6, 8? No, Visual board shows T at (6,6)? Wait, let's check the visual board again.\n        *   Visual Board Row 6: `6 . . . . . . T . T .`\n        *   Visual Board Row 7: `7 A A . . . . . . T .`\n        *   Visual Board Row 8: `8 . . . . . . T T T .`\n        *   Enemy Head (7, 5).

No, Row 7 `7 A A . . . . . . T .` shows only (8, 8?) is T.\n        *   Actually, looking closely at the prompt board:\n            *   Row 8: `8 . . . . . . T T T .` (x=6, 7, 8 are T)\n            *   Row 7: `7 A A . . . . . . T .` (x=8 is T)\n            *   Row 6: `6 . . . . . . T . T .` (x=6 is T, x=8 is T)\n            *   Row 5: `5 . . . . A . T 0 T .` (x=6 is T, x=7 is 0, x=8 is T)\n        *   So the enemy is a vertical line at x=7, 8, 6?\n        *   Enemy Head: (7, 5).\n        *   Enemy Body: (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8).\n        *   **Crucial Info:** The enemy is blocked from moving DOWN? No, (7, 4) is empty.\n        *   Is the enemy blocked from moving UP? (7, 6) is empty ('.' in visual row 6? No, row 6 has T at 6 and 8, but '.' at 7).\n        *   So (7, 6) is empty.\n        *   The enemy can move UP (7, 6), DOWN (7, 4), LEFT (6, 5), or RIGHT (8, 5).\n        *   Wait, is (8, 5) his body? Yes, \"Body: [(8, 5)...]\". So RIGHT is blocked by his own body.\n\n**MY OPTIONS:**\n1.  **UP (7, 3):** Towards the gap.\n    *   If Enemy goes DOWN (7, 4): We are adjacent. No collision.\n    *   If Enemy goes UP (7, 6): Distance increases.\n    *   If Enemy goes LEFT (6, 5): We are close.\n    *   **Risk:** If I go UP now, and he goes DOWN, next turn I might want to go UP again to (7, 4) and he might go DOWN to (7, 3). We would collide if we cross? No, simultaneous. We only collide if we land on the *same* square.\n    *   If I go UP to (7, 3) and he goes DOWN to (7, 4): No collision.\n    *   If I stay UP strategy: Next turn I go to (7, 4), he goes to (7, 3). No collision.\n    *   If I go to (7, 4) and he goes to (7, 4): Collision. Tie. I lose (6 vs 4).\n    *   **Is (7, 3) safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Future:** From (7, 3), I can go LEFT (6, 3), RIGHT (8, 3), UP (7, 4), DOWN (7, 2).\n2.  **DOWN (7, 1):**\n    *   Target: Apple at (7, 1).\n    *   Is it safe? (7, 1) is currently empty.\n    *   Does it allow me to eat? YES. +1 Point.\n    *   **Risk:** The enemy is at (7, 5). He is far. He can't reach (7, 1) this turn.\n    *   **Future:** From (7, 1), I can go to (6, 1), (8, 1), (7, 0), or (7, 2).\n    *   (7, 0) is empty.\n    *   (8, 1) is empty.\n    *   (6, 1) is empty.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 2):**\n    *   Moves towards (4, 2) and (3, 3).\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   No immediate apple (Apple at 2,2? No, row 2 `2 . . A . A . . . A .` -> x=2 is apple, x=4 is apple).\n    *   (6, 2) is empty.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 2):**\n    *   Target: Apple at (8, 2).\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Future: (9, 2) or (8, 3) or (8, 1).\n    *   (9, 4) is also an apple, but further.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am trailing 4 vs 6. I MUST eat apples.\n(7, 1) is an apple DOWN from me.\n(8, 2) is an apple RIGHT from me.\n(2, 2) is an apple LEFT from me (but further).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 1):\n- I gain +1 point (Score 5 vs 6).\n- I secure a position in the bottom-left apple cluster ((7,1), (0,0) cluster).\n- The enemy is top-right. He is moving (likely UP or LEFT).\n- If he moves UP (7, 6), he goes away from me.\n- If he moves LEFT (6, 5), he goes towards center.\n- If he moves DOWN (7, 4), he comes closer, but I am at y=1, he is at y=4. 3 cells gap.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 2):\n- I gain +1 point.\n- I am closer to the enemy (x=8 vs x=7).\n- I am near the right wall.\n- The bottom left is safer long term.\n\nIf I go UP to (7, 3):\n- I don't eat.\n- I engage the enemy directly.\n- Since I have fewer apples, head-on collision is suicide.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nTake the apple DOWN at (7, 1). It is safe, increases score, and moves me away from the opponent. I will claim the bottom territory.\n\n**MOVE:**\nDOWN\n\n**PLAN:**\nEat (7, 1). Next turn, move to (6, 1) or (7, 0) to sweep the bottom row apples (1,0), (3,0), (4,0). Avoid the enemy who is likely moving towards the center or top.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT and UP are blocked by our own body/tail, and DOWN becomes the neck. That\u2019s a one-exit corridor \u2014 easy to trap ourselves.\n- LEFT to (6,6) keeps TWO useful follow-ups (LEFT to 5,6 and UP to 6,7). DOWN is blocked by the opponent body at (6,5) so we\u2019re not walking into a trap, and RIGHT would be our neck anyway. More options = more control and less chance of getting boxed.\n- Positionally, (6,6) puts pressure above the opponent\u2019s column (they\u2019ve got segments at 6,4 and 6,5). From there we can threaten to slide down and hem them in or time a head-on if they try to force through \u2014 and we\u2019re up 6\u21924 on apples, so we can be aggressive when the odds favor us.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (6,6).\n- Immediately look to occupy 6,7 or 5,6 to maintain lateral control and deny escape routes to the right.\n- If the opponent tries to flee up the board toward us, time a head-on only when it\u2019s guaranteed to KO them or when we still survive. Otherwise, keep circling and using our lead to dominate space and force them into tight columns.\n\nLEFT",

We are currently tied 5-5 in apples (I ate last turn, so I am now 5? Wait, the scoreboard says I have 5 and opponent has 6. Okay, I am trailing by 1 apple again. I need to eat.)\n\n**BOARD SCAN:**\n- **My Body:** Head at (7, 1). Body goes up to (7, 2) (empty this turn because I'm eating (7, 1)), then (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5).\n- **Enemy:** Head at (6, 6). Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)].\n- **The Trap:** The enemy is at (6, 6). He is boxed in by his own body at (7, 6) and (7, 5). \n- **Enemy Moves:**\n    - UP (6, 7): Valid? Yes. (Visual: Row 7, x=6 is 'A' (apple), but that's fine).\n    - DOWN (6, 5): **BLOCKED** (My body is at (6, 5)? No, my body ends at (6, 5). Yes, (6, 5) is occupied by my tail. Enemy cannot go DOWN.\n    - LEFT (5, 6): Valid? Yes.\n    - RIGHT (7, 6): **BLOCKED** (Own body).\n    \n**PREDICTION:**\nThe enemy is trapped. He will likely go **UP** to (6, 7) to eat the apple, or **LEFT** to (5, 6). \nIf he goes UP to (6, 7), he moves *away* from me (distance increases).\nIf he goes LEFT to (5, 6), he moves *towards* me but stays in the center.\n\n**MY OPTIONS:**\n1.  **UP (7, 2):** This is my own body segment (from previous turn). **ILLEGAL/DEATH.**\n2.  **DOWN (7, 0):** This cell is **CLEAR** (Visual Board: Row 0, x=7 is '.'). This is safe. It moves me to the bottom edge.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 1):** Cell is **CLEAR**. Safe. Moves me towards the left side apples (0,0 cluster).\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 1):** Cell is **CLEAR**. Safe. Moves me towards the right side apple (9, 4).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am trailing 5-6. I need to eat an apple. \n- **No apples at (7, 0), (6, 1), or (8, 1).**\n- However, looking at the map, (6, 1) gives me access to the apple at (4, 0) and (3, 0) and (1, 0) on the bottom row next turn.\n- (8, 1) is isolated near the right wall. The right wall is dangerous because the enemy is nearby at (6, 6).\n- (7, 0) puts me in the bottom center. I can go to (6, 0) next, then (5, 0)... eventually (4, 0).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to secure the bottom row. The enemy is moving UP or LEFT. He is not coming down to the bottom row this turn.\nIf I go **LEFT to (6, 1)**:\n- I am safe.\n- I am setting up to sweep the bottom row apples starting from (4, 0) or (3, 0) next turn.\n- I am moving away from the enemy's likely position (Center/Top-Left).\n- (8, 1) is risky because I'm near the enemy's potential path if he goes to the right, but mostly it's a dead end. (6, 1) opens up the whole left side.\n\n**MOVE:**\nLEFT\n\n**PLAN:**\nMove to (6, 1) to position for the bottom row sweep. I'll aim for the apples at (4, 0), (3, 0), and (1, 0). The enemy is trapped in the top-left quadrant, forcing him to climb higher or move into the center where I can eventually cut him off. I need to close the score gap (5 vs 6) immediately.\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s break it down fast and dirty.\n\nQuick legal sweep from our HEAD at (6,6):\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,6): illegal \u2014 that\u2019s our neck. Backwards = insta-death. \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5): illegal \u2014 opponent body sitting there. Don\u2019t walk into their ribs. \u274c  \n- UP \u2192 (6,7): legal \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,6): legal \u2705\n\nWhy UP beats LEFT this turn:\n- UP gives us MORE follow-up exits: from (6,7) we retain UP, LEFT, and RIGHT as legal escapes next turn (down would be our neck). That keeps options open and avoids getting funneled. More exits = harder to be boxed.  \n- LEFT to (5,6) is fine but slightly tighter: it blocks our right and leaves fewer flexible escape lines. We don\u2019t want to self-narrow when the rival\u2019s column (6\u20137 area) is where the fight\u2019s brewing.  \n- We\u2019re up 6\u21925 apples \u2014 we can press the action, but only when the head-on is guaranteed. UP positions us above the mid-columns, giving better leverage to hem them in if they try to climb north later. Play aggressive, not dumb. \ud83d\ude0e\u2694\ufe0f\n\nRisk check:\n- No immediate head-on threat this turn. No move kills us except the two illegal ones above. UP maximizes safe follow-ups and control over the center/top-middle of the board.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP now to (6,7). Then pivot to 6,8 or 5,7 to keep lateral pressure on column 6\u20137.  \n- If opponent tries to climb into our zone, time a head-on only when they\u2019re forced into a 50/50 we win (we\u2019re +1 apple). Otherwise, keep circling and use superior space control to squeeze them into a wall.\n\nUP",

(I am trailing, need to eat).\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n*   **Apple at (4, 0):** This is a prime target. It's on the bottom row. To reach it efficiently, I need to move **LEFT** to (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 0).\n*   **Apple at (3, 0):** Also on the bottom row, slightly left of (4, 0).\n*   **Apple at (1, 0):** Far left bottom.\n\n**Position Check:**\n*   My head is at **(6, 1)**.\n*   My body occupies: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4).\n*   Enemy head is at **(6, 7)**. Distance: 6 units away (vertical). Not an immediate collision threat unless he moves down 6 times in one turn (impossible).\n\n**Move Options:**\n1.  **UP (6, 2):**\n    *   Check if (6, 2) is occupied: Looking at the visual board, Row 2, x=6 is empty ('.').\n    *   However, looking at the board state provided, my body ends at (6, 4). (6, 2) is empty.\n    *   *BUT* I need to check my previous moves. My body is [(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)].\n    *   Wait, if I move UP from (6, 1) to (6, 2), am I hitting myself? My body segments are (7, 1), (7, 2)... (6, 2) is NOT in my body list.\n    *   However, let's look at the visual board again.\n        Row 2: `. . A . A . . T A .`\n        Columns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n        At x=6, y=2: The visual shows '.' (empty).\n    *   *Wait*, let's check the body list carefully. My body is: [(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)].\n    *   If I move UP to (6, 2), I am safe regarding my own body.\n    *   Is there an apple? No.\n    *   Does it get me closer to (4, 0)? No, it moves me away from the bottom row apples.\n\n2.  **DOWN (6, 0):**\n    *   Coordinates: (6, 0).\n    *   Visual Board Row 0: `. A . A A . . . . .`\n    *   At x=6, y=0: It is '.' (empty).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Apple? No.\n    *   Strategy: Moves me to the bottom row. From here, I can go LEFT to (5, 0) -> (4, 0) to eat the apple next turn. This positions me perfectly for the bottom row apples.\n\n3.  **LEFT (5, 1):**\n    *   Coordinates: (5, 1).\n    *   Visual Board Row 1: `. . . A . . 1 T . .` (Wait, my head is now at 6, 1, so Row 1 at x=5 is empty).\n    *   Visual Board Row 1: `. . . A . . . . . .` (Previous turn visual).\n    *   Let's check the provided board state. My body occupies (7, 1). (5, 1) is empty.\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Apple? No.\n    *   Strategy: Moves me towards (4, 0). From (5, 1), next move to (4, 1) -> (4, 0).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 1):**\n    *   Coordinates: (7, 1).\n    *   Check: My body *starts* at (7, 1) (the segment behind my head).\n    *   **CRITICAL:** Moving Right puts my head into the cell where my body currently is. This is hitting myself.\n    *   **DEATH.** Eliminate.\n\n**Comparison (LEFT vs DOWN):**\n*   **DOWN (6, 0):** Gets me on the bottom row. Future moves: (5, 0), (4, 0). The path is clear. I can eat the apple at (4, 0) or (3, 0) very soon.\n*   **LEFT (5, 1):** Stays on row 1. Future moves: (4, 1) -> (4, 0).\n*   Both get me to the apple at (4, 0) in 2 moves (assuming I go Down->Left or Left->Down).\n*   However, looking at the board, there is an apple at **(8, 2)** (Visual: Row 2, x=8 is 'A').\n    *   If I go **DOWN (6, 0)**, I am at the bottom. (8, 2) is far.\n    *   If I go **LEFT (5, 1)**, I am still on row 1. (8, 2) is to the right.\n    *   Wait, where are the apples?\n        (4, 0) - Bottom row.\n        (3, 0) - Bottom row.\n        (1, 0) - Bottom row.\n        (8, 2) - Top right area.\n    *   The bottom row cluster is the most promising. The enemy is at (6, 7). He is high up. He is not a threat to the bottom row right now.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\n*   Enemy at (6, 7).\n*   Options: UP (6, 8), LEFT (5, 7), RIGHT (7, 7), DOWN (6, 6 - blocked by own body).\n*   He is likely moving UP or LEFT.\n*   He is nowhere near me.\n\n**Decision:**\nI need to secure the bottom row apples. Moving **DOWN** to (6, 0) puts me directly on the bottom row, securing my position against the wall. From (6, 0), I can move LEFT to (5, 0) and then (4, 0) to eat the apple. This is a safe, aggressive path to close the score gap.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to secure the bottom row. Then sweep LEFT to eat the apples at (4, 0), (3, 0), and (1, 0). Keep the enemy trapped in the top-left. Don't give him any openings.\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)].\n*   **Enemy Snake (0):** Head at **(6, 8)**. Body: [(6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)].\n*   **Score:** Me 5 - Enemy 6. I'm still trailing. I need apples.\n\n**Board Analysis (Turn 27):**\n*   **My Position:** I am at **(6, 0)** on the bottom row.\n*   **Apple Cluster:** There is a dense cluster of apples on the bottom row: (4, 0), (3, 0), and (1, 0). This is my primary hunting ground.\n*   **Enemy Position:** The enemy is high up at (6, 8). He is moving towards the top-right corner apples ((9, 4), (9, 8)). He is NOT a direct threat to me right now. He is 8 squares away vertically.\n*   **Threat Assessment:**\n    *   If I go **RIGHT (7, 0)**: Safe. But leads away from the bottom row cluster. (8, 0) is empty, but (9, 0) is empty. It's a dead end at the wall. I'd have to loop back. Bad for speed.\n    *   If I go **UP (6, 1)**: This is my tail's current position. **CRITICAL:** If I move UP, I hit my own body immediately. **DEATH.** (Note: In the visual board, (6, 1) shows '1' which is my head, but my body list says the segment behind my head is at (6, 1). Since I just moved down to (6, 0), my tail (6, 4) moves forward to (6, 3)? Wait, let's trace the body movement. The body list is: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]. The head is at (6, 0). The segment behind the head is (6, 1). If I move UP to (6, 1), I am moving into the cell currently occupied by my body. **NO.** Wait, looking at the board state provided: Row 1 is `. . . . . . 1 . . .`. My head is at (6, 1)? No, the prompt says: \"Head: (6, 0)\". The visual board shows row 0 as `. A . A A . 1 . . .`. So Head is at (6, 0). The body is at (6, 1). If I move UP, I go to (6, 1). Is (6, 1) occupied by my body? YES. The body list explicitly starts with (6, 1). So moving UP kills me. **ELIMINATED.**\n    *   If I go **LEFT (5, 0)**: Safe. (5, 0) is empty ('.'). This moves me directly towards the apples at (4, 0) and (3, 0).\n    *   If I go **DOWN (-1, 0)**: Off the board. **DEATH.**\n\n**Decision:**\nI must go **LEFT**.\n1.  **Safety:** (5, 0) is empty. No body there. Enemy is far away.\n2.  **Objective:** I am chasing the apples at (4, 0) and (3, 0). Moving Left positions me at (5, 0), from which I can eat the apple at (4, 0) next turn.\n3.  **Strategy:** Dominate the bottom row. Trap the enemy in the upper half. Force a win by securing the food source he can't reach easily.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apples on the bottom row (4, 0) and (3, 0) in the next two turns. Then sweep up the left side if possible. Keep the enemy contained in the top-right. If he comes down, we use our body to box him in.\n\nLEFT",

Nope. \u274c  \n- UP \u2192 (6,9): legal, but it\u2019s the top row \u2014 next turn we\u2019d only have LEFT or RIGHT (2 follow-ups). Tightens options. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8): legal, ok for pressure, but pushes toward our own body cluster on the right (7,6 / 8,6 / 8,5). Risk of narrowing. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8): legal and best for flexibility \u2014 from there we keep UP, LEFT, DOWN as viable follow-ups (3 options) and can pivot to cut off the opponent later. \u2705\u2705\n\nEnemy check: Opp head at (6,0). They cannot go UP into (6,1) (their neck), so they\u2019ll likely go LEFT (5,0) or RIGHT (7,0) to start climbing. They\u2019re far; we have time to set a trap. We\u2019re +1 apple \u2014 we can force a head-on when they\u2019re boxed. Want that advantage? Duh. \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort-term plan (for replay next turn):\n- Move LEFT now to keep max options and start shifting control of the upper-middle.  \n- Watch opponent\u2019s approach along cols 5\u20137; gradually wall them in by occupying key chokepoints (aim to control x=5\u20137 across y=6\u20139).  \n- Only take a head-on when they\u2019re pressed against the wall or their escape is cut \u2014 we have the apple edge, so win that 50/50 when it\u2019s forced.\n\nLet\u2019s stay flexible, keep options open, and bait them north into our box.

No. My body starts at (6, 0) and goes up/wall. (4, 0) is empty.\n    *   Is it enemy body? No.\n    *   **CRITICAL:** Is there a threat of a head-on collision? The enemy is at (5, 8). He is extremely far away. He cannot reach (4, 0) this turn. Moving LEFT is safe.\n\n*   **Check Other Moves (Sanity Check):**\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 0):** That's my tail's position *before* I move? Wait, my body is [(6, 0)...]. (6, 0) is currently occupied by my body. If I move RIGHT, I hit myself. **DEATH.**\n    *   **UP (5, 1):** Is it safe? (5, 1) is currently a '.' (empty).

This brings me to 6 apples, tying the score!\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need to close the gap. Eating is priority #1. Moving UP to (5, 1) leaves the apple at (4, 0) vulnerable. The enemy is busy in the top-right. He's not a threat to this apple. If I don't take it, I'm throwing away momentum.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (4, 0). Then sweep the rest of the bottom row. The enemy is cornered in the top-right. We dominate the bottom-left and sweep the flanks. Trap him against the wall.\n\nLet's get that point!\n\nLEFT",

Let's see the board state.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- **My Snake (1):** Head at **(4, 0)** (I ate the apple, so my body is now [(5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)] with the tail still at (7, 3) because I grew). Score: 6 apples.\n- **Enemy Snake (0):** Head at **(4, 8)** (he moved Left from (5, 8)). Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)]. Score: 6 apples.\n- **Apples:** There's one right next to me at (3, 0)! And another at (1, 0) further left.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nI'm at the bottom row (y=0). The enemy is way up at y=8, cornered in the top-right. The apple at (3, 0) is literally RIGHT there. Moving LEFT to (3, 0) gets me another point and grows my snake, putting me ahead in score!\n\n**Safety Check (LEFT to (3, 0)):**\n1. Is it on the board? Yes (3, 0).\n2. Is it my own body? My body is at (5,0),(6,0)... (3,0) is clear.\n3. Is it enemy body? No.\n4. Head-on collision? Enemy is at (4,8) - he can't reach (3, 0) this turn. Safe.\n\n**Other moves:**\n- **RIGHT (5, 0):** That's my body! DEAD.\n- **DOWN (-1, 0):** Off board! DEAD.\n- **UP (4, 1):** Safe? (4, 1) is currently empty (dot). But why go up when I can eat immediately?\n\n**Strategy:**\nTake the apple at (3, 0) and lead the score 7-6! The enemy is trapped in the top-right. I need to sweep the bottom row and then start boxing him in. He's confined to columns 4-9 and rows 5-9 based on his body. I own the bottom-left.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (3, 0) to take the lead. Then eat the apple at (1, 0) next turn. After that, I need to start moving UP to cut off his escape routes and trap him against the right wall.\n\nLET'S GET THIS BREAD!\n\nLEFT",

I just ate the apple at (3, 0), so I'm longer now!\n- **Enemy Snake (0):** Head at **(3, 8)**. Body: [(4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6)]. He's still trapped in the top-right corner.\n- **Apples:** The apple at (3, 0) is gone. Next closest apples: (1, 0) to the left, (0, 3) up-left, (2, 2) up-right. We should go for (1, 0) to keep the pressure on!\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nI'm at (3, 0). The apple at (1, 0) is two steps away. The enemy is at (3, 8), moving up from (4, 8). He's not threatening us right now. We own the bottom.\n\n**Safety Check (LEFT to (2, 0)):**\n1. On board? Yes (2, 0).\n2. My body? My body starts at (4, 0). (2, 0) is clear. NOT backwards (backwards would be (4, 0), which is my body, so LEFT is actually forward relative to my current head direction? Wait, my head was at (4,0) last turn and I moved LEFT to (3,0). So my tail is at (7,3). Moving LEFT from (3,0) to (2,0) is forward and safe.\n3. Enemy body? No.\n4. Head-on collision? Enemy at (3, 8) is far away.\n\n**Other moves:**\n- **RIGHT (4, 0):** That's my body! DEAD.\n- **DOWN (3, -1):** Off board! DEAD.\n- **UP (3, 1):** Safe? (3, 1) is empty. But (1, 0) is the apple I want next. UP puts me at (3,1) which is a decent position, but LEFT sets me up perfectly for the apple at (1,0) next turn. Also, (3,1) is currently \"A\" on the board map? Let me check the board map again... Wait, looking at the board map provided: \n9 . . . . . . . A . .\n8 . . . 0 T T T . . A\n7 A A . . . . T . . .\n6 . . . . . . T T . A\n5 . . . . A . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . A\n3 A A . A . . . T . .  <-- (3,3) is A, (3,2) is A? No, (3,2) is \".\"? Wait, coordinates: (3,3) is A. (3,2) is \"A\" in the text \"A A .\"? Actually row 3 is \"A A . A .\". So (0,3)=A, (1,3)=A, (2,3)=., (3,3)=A. \nWait, I need to check (3,1). Row 1 is \". . . A . . T T . .\". So (3,1) is \"A\"! Oh wait, the board map says row 1: \" . . . A . . T T . .\" which corresponds to x=0..9. So x=3 is \"A\". \nIf I move UP to (3,1), I eat an apple! That's even better than (1,0)! I missed that in my initial scan.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\nMoving UP to (3, 1) gives me an immediate apple. This puts me at 8 apples vs enemy's 6. Massive lead. Then I can continue sweeping the upper left area or turn back down. \n\n**Safety of UP (3,1):**\n1. On board: Yes.\n2. My body: My body is [(4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)]. (3,1) is not in that list. It's not backwards (which would be (4,0)).\n3. Enemy body: No.\n4. Head-on: Enemy at (3,8) is far.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUP is the power move. Eat the apple at (3, 1). Secure the lead. Then plan to move towards the cluster in the top-left.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat (3,1) now. Then likely move UP to (3,2) or LEFT to (2,1) depending on next apple spawns.

The enemy is still trapped at the top, and we just secured another apple.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- **My Snake (1):** Head at **(3, 1)** (I ate the apple here last turn!). Body: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)].\n- **Enemy Snake (0):** Head at **(2, 8)**. Body: [(3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)]. He's creeping left but still boxed in.\n- **Apples:** I'm sitting on an apple I just ate. Next closest target: The board map shows a sweet cluster. I'm currently at (3,1). The apple at (3,2) is directly above me!\n\n**Board Analysis & Safety Check:**\nI'm at (3, 1). I need to move to a safe cell.\n\n1.  **UP (3, 2):**\n    *   **Board:** Valid (0-9).\n    *   **My Body:** My body is mostly at y=0 and x>3. (3,2) is clear. NOT backwards (backwards is (3,0)).\n    *   **Enemy:** Enemy is at y=8, far away.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** This moves me directly into an apple! The board map shows (3,2) is an apple. Eating it puts me at 9 apples, doubling my lead. This also brings me closer to the other apples at (2,2) and (3,3) for the next turns.\n\n2.  **DOWN (3, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Valid, empty, but (3,0) is part of my body from 2 turns ago. Wait, let's check. My body is [(3, 0)...]. Yes, (3,0) is my body. If I move DOWN, I hit my own body. **DEAD.** Correcting my thought process: My tail is at (7,3). Moving from (3,1) to (3,0) is moving backwards into my own tail? No, my body goes (3,0)->(4,0)... (3,0) is the second segment. If I move DOWN, I hit (3,0) which is MY BODY. **DEAD.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (2, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Valid. My body is at (3,0) and (4,0)... (2,1) is clear. NOT backwards.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Safe, but no apple immediately. Moves me away from the (3,2) apple.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Valid. My body starts at (3,0) and goes to (4,0). (4,1) is currently empty. NOT backwards.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Safe, but no apple immediately.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP to (3, 2) is the power move. It's an instant apple eat, pushing me to 9 score. It keeps me in the center of the map to react to where the next apples spawn or where the enemy decides to panic. I have plenty of space behind me to turn around if needed later.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (3,2). Then on Turn 32, assess the apples at (2,2) or (3,3). I want to sweep the center-left area and keep the pressure on the enemy. If he moves down aggressively, I'll be ready to box him in. I am the king of this board!\n\nUP",

Turn 31 \u2014 time to keep the pressure and avoid giving up a head-on while we\u2019re down by 2 apples. Quick scan and play-by-play:\n\nImmediate legality check (no brain farts):\n- RIGHT -> (3,8) is our neck (backwards) \u2192 insta-death. ELIMINATE. \u274c\n- UP -> (2,9) on-board and empty. Legal. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN -> (2,7) on-board and empty. Legal. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT -> (1,8) on-board and empty. Legal. \u2705\n\nRisk assessment & follow-up options:\n- UP to (2,9): hugs the top wall. After moving there we lose an escape dimension (UP is off-board next turn), leaving only LEFT/RIGHT as non-back options. Tightens flexibility \u2014 not great for baiting or corralling. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN to (2,7): moves toward center and an apple at (1,7) is reachable next turn. Good for aggression, but it also pulls us into more congested midboard paths and reduces the immediate ability to clamp the top corridor. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT to (1,8): keeps us on the top band, preserves three non-back follow-ups (UP, LEFT, DOWN), and positions us to slowly run the top row/columns and start hemming the board from above. No apple this turn (so no growth, tail will move), which keeps our shape flexible for trapping maneuvers. \u2705\u2705\n\nEnemy note: Opponent head at (3,1) \u2014 far away and likely to move UP (toward apples). They can\u2019t move DOWN (neck at (3,0)), so no sudden head-on threat this turn. We\u2019re down on apples (6 vs 8), so we should NOT gamble on a mutual-head collision; instead, build positional dominance and force mistakes. Play aggressive positioning, not reckless trading.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Keep control of the top corridor: slide left along row 8\u21929 when safe to compress the board from above.\n- Avoid isolating ourselves against the top wall (don\u2019t go UP into dead-ends unless we can pivot horizontally next turn).\n- Once we\u2019ve got more board behind us (and ideally +1\u20132 apples), start pushing down and cutting columns 2\u20134 to herd the opponent into a worsening box. Force them into a head-on only when we lead apples or can guarantee they hit our body.\n\nMove call \u2014 we keep our options open, maintain pressure, and preserve the clamp. LET\u2019S STAY HIGH, STAY SNEAKY, AND BUILD THE NOOSE. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

Their neck at (3,1) blocks DOWN, so they\u2019ll probably push toward nearby apples (2,2),(3,3),(4,2),(1,3).

Moving onto (1,7) will GROW us this turn (apple), so our tail won\u2019t move \u2014 keep that in mind for space calculations, but it\u2019s still safe.\n\nStrategy reasoning and preference:\n- We\u2019re down 6 \u2192 8 apples. We should prioritize apples when safe to close the gap. Eating at (1,7) cuts the deficit to 1 apple and increases our leverage to force risky plays later.\n- DOWN keeps two viable follow-up directions (LEFT to the easy apple at (0,7) or RIGHT into the center corridor), so it maintains options while giving us immediate scoring benefit. This fits \u201cbe aggressive and grow to dominate.\u201d\n- LEFT or UP preserve top control but pass up an easy apple. We need apples, so passing would be suboptimal right now.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this becomes our next-last-rationale):\n- Grab (1,7) now. If safe, chain to (0,7) for another apple, swinging us into the lead.\n- After getting ahead, start compressing from the top band down into columns 2\u20134 to herd the opponent into tighter space. Avoid head-on unless we lead apples or can guarantee they hit our body.\n- Keep our body shape compact and avoid head-on confrontations until we have the apple advantage to force a win or trade favorably.\n\nFinal call \u2014 execute the apple play, close the gap, and start pressuring midboard next turn.\n\nDOWN",

He's still boxed in at the top right.\n\n**Safety Check for Turn 33 (From Head (3, 3)):**\n1.  **UP (3, 4):**\n    *   **Board:** Valid (0-9).\n    *   **My Body:** (3, 4) is empty.

I secure an apple immediately (turning 9 into 10), stay away from the walls, and keep my options open. I'm not boxing myself in. I'm claiming territory.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGrab (2, 3). Then I can look at sweeping the bottom left or center. The enemy is still trapped, and I need to keep my lead growing.\n\nLEFT",

From there, use RIGHT/DOWN to avoid self-collision and chase the next nearby apples while keeping our body compact.\n- If opponent drifts up, look to corral them into columns 2\u20134; avoid head-on unless we\u2019re ahead on apples or can force them into our body.\n- Prioritize chaining apples while maintaining 2+ safe exits from our head each turn.\n\nLET\u2019S GO GET THAT APPLE AND START THE BOX-IN. \ud83d\udd12\ud83d\ude24\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is still trapped in the top-right corner, and I just ate that apple at (2, 3) last turn. Now I'm sitting at (2, 3) with my body trailing down and right.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Head at 2, 3):**\n*   **My Body:** [(3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1)]\n*   **Enemy:** Head at (2, 7), Body filling the top rows. He's boxed in and can't reach me yet.\n*   **Apples:** I see an apple at (1, 0) and (2, 2). The (2, 2) apple is *dangerous* because my body is at (3, 2) right next to it. If I go DOWN to (2, 2) to eat that apple, I risk trapping myself against my own body at (3, 2) next turn.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n1.  **UP (2, 4):** Valid. Empty. Safe. Keeps me central. Good options for next turn.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 2):** Valid. **APPLE HERE!** I'd eat it and grow. *However*, looking at the board, (3, 2) is my body. If I eat (2, 2) and grow, my head is at (2, 2) with body at (3, 2) and (3, 3). Next turn, my only safe moves might be limited (Left to 1,2 or Up to 2,3). It's a bit tight.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 3):** Valid. Empty. Safe. No apple immediately, but opens up the left side.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 3):** **DEAD!** That's my current body segment (where my head just was). I cannot move backwards.\n\n**The Play:**\nGoing **UP** to (2, 4) is the best move. Why?\n1.  **Safety:** It's completely empty. No body collision, no wall, no enemy.\n2.  **Positioning:** It keeps me in the center of the board (x=2, y=4). This gives me maximum flexibility to pivot left, right, or up next turn.\n3.  **Future Proofing:** I avoid the potential trap of going DOWN to (2, 2). While that apple is tempting, getting boxed in by my own body is a classic streamer fail. I want to stay mobile.\n4.  **Enemy Tracking:** The enemy is still stuck at (2, 7). If I go UP, I get closer to his territory. If he's trapped, he might make a desperate move. I need to be ready to strike or dodge.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the center. Watch the enemy at (2, 7). If he moves down, I can potentially cut him off or force a collision since I'm bigger (9 vs 8). I'll chase apples opportunistically, but board control is king right now. Don't get greedy and tunnel vision on a single apple if it compromises mobility.\n\nLet's keep the pressure on! UP! \ud83d\udc0d",

The score is tight, but we've got the board control.\n\n**Position Check (Head at 2, 4):**\n*   **My Body:** [(2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1)]\n*   **Enemy:** Head at (2, 6). His body runs from (2, 7) across the top and down to (6, 8).\n*   **Board State:** Enemy is still boxed in the top-right quadrant. He's gotta move down or left eventually. I'm currently at (2, 4), directly below him.\n\n**Safety & Movement Analysis:**\n1.  **UP (2, 5):** **DANGER!** Wait, looking at the board map provided, (2, 5) is marked as `.` (empty). But looking at the *text description*, (2, 6) is the enemy head. So (2, 5) is physically empty. **HOWEVER**, if the enemy moves **DOWN** from (2, 6) to (2, 5) this turn, we collide head-on. If I go UP and he goes DOWN, we both die. I have 9 apples, he has 8. I win the tie-breaker by score. **BUT**, if I die, I lose the win. I cannot risk a mutual collision unless I *know* he's trapped and has no choice, or I'm cornering him. He has space to move Left to (1, 6) or Right (though he's against the wall). He might move Left. It's risky. **UPDATE:** I need to re-read the board. The board says `.` at (2, 5). The enemy head is at (2, 6). If I move UP to (2, 5), and he moves DOWN to (2, 5), we tie/die. Since I'm winning, I shouldn't force a tie if I can avoid it. But is (2, 5) actually empty? Let's look closer at the visual map:\n   ```\n    6 . . 0 . . . . . . A\n    5 . . . . A . . . . .\n    4 . . 1 . . . . . A A\n   ```\n   Yes, (2, 5) is empty. But (2, 6) is '0' (Enemy Head).\n   **CRITICAL REALIZATION:** I am at (2, 4). The enemy is at (2, 6). We are in the same column.\n   If I go **UP**, I go to (2, 5).\n   If he goes **DOWN**, he goes to (2, 5).\n   **HEAD ON COLLISION.**\n   As the player with more apples (9 vs 8), I technically win if we both crash. *But*, the goal is to WIN, not just tie-breaker win a crash. If I crash, I die. The game checks apples at the moment of death. I have more. I win the game if all snakes die.\n   However, if he moves Left to (1, 6) and I go UP to (2, 5), I am safe. I am moving into his potential path, but I'm gambling he won't move down.\n\n2.  **DOWN (2, 3):** **DEAD.** That is my current body. I just came from there. Can't go backwards.\n\n3.  **LEFT (1, 4):** Valid. Empty. Safe. This moves me away from the enemy, which is usually bad for aggression, but it secures my life. It opens up the left side of the board.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 4):** Valid. Empty. Safe. Moves me towards the center/right. My body is at (3, 3) below, so I'm not trapping myself immediately.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe enemy is at (2, 6). He is trapped in the top-right. If I move **UP** to (2, 5), I am boxing him in further. If he moves down, we crash. Since I have more apples, a head-on collision results in MY WIN. This is the \"aggressive\" play.\nIs he forced to move down? No, he can move Left (1, 6).\nIf I move **LEFT** to (1, 4), I play it safe. I lose contact with him.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (3, 4), I play it safe.\n\n**The Aggression Play:**\nWe have more apples. We want to force the issue.\nIf I go **UP**, I threaten him. If he panics and moves down, I win the game instantly.\nIf he moves left, I'm at (2, 5) and he's at (1, 6). I'm still in a good spot.\nThe only risk is if he moves down. But since I win the tie-breaker... is it worth it?\nActually, if we BOTH die, the game ends and I win because I have more apples.\nSo, **UP** is a winning move whether he moves down or not (if he moves down, I win the game via tie-breaker; if he moves left, I position aggressively).\n\nWait, the rules say: \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins.\"\nI have 9, he has 8.\nIf I go UP and he goes DOWN, we both die. I WIN.\n\nSo, **UP** is technically a checkmate move. He cannot kill me without me winning the game.\nTherefore, **UP** is the move.\n\nLet's verify safety against other things.\nUP to (2, 5). Is it empty? Yes.\nIs it a wall? No.\nIs it my body? No.\nIs it enemy body? His body is at (2, 7) and above, and (3, 8) etc. Not at (2, 5).\nSo, (2, 5) is physically safe from bodies.\nThe only danger is the enemy head at (2, 6) moving to (2, 5).\n\nI will take the checkmate.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nForce the confrontation. I have the score advantage. If he wants to live, he has to move out of the way. If he wants to fight, I win the tie-breaker. Push him into the corner and end this game.\n\nLET'S GOOO!\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nYO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 35 and we're looking CRISP with 9 apples to their 8. The score is tight, but we've got the board control.\n\n**Position Check (Head at 2, 4):**\n*   **Enemy:** Head at (2, 6). Body runs across the top.\n*   **Board State:** Enemy is boxed in the top-right quadrant.\n\n**Safety & Movement Analysis:**\n1.  **UP (2, 5):** **THE KILL SHOT.** This puts me directly below the enemy head. If he moves DOWN, we crash. I have 9 apples, he has 8. If we both die, I WIN via tie-breaker. If he moves LEFT to escape, I've successfully pushed him back and maintained pressure. (2, 5) is currently empty and safe from walls/bodies.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 3):** **DEAD.** That's my body.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 4):** Safe, but passive. I lose contact with the enemy.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 4):** Safe, but passive. I drift away from the enemy.\n\n**The Aggression Play:**\nI have the score advantage (9 vs 8). In a head-on collision, I win. By moving **UP**, I put him in a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" situation.\n*   If he moves DOWN to (2, 5): We crash. **I WIN THE GAME.**\n*   If he moves LEFT to (1, 6): I survive at (2, 5) and continue to box him in.\nThere is no scenario where moving UP results in a loss for me (unless I miscalculated the board, but the visual map confirms (2, 5) is empty).\n\n**Strategy:**\nForce the confrontation. I have the score advantage. If he wants to live, he has to move out of the way. If he wants to fight, I win the tie-breaker.
