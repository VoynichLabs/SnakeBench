Wait: growth happens after move, so next turn length 3, tail stays until next move? Actually: after eating, new segment appears at tail position before moving, so tail stays at (8,2) until next move, then moves forward. So next turn possible moves from (8,0):  \n- UP (8,1) \u2013 my body (unsafe).  \n- DOWN (8,-1) \u2013 off board (unsafe).  \n- LEFT (7,0) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (9,0) \u2013 empty.  \nOnly 2 safe follow-ups (LEFT, RIGHT). That\u2019s risky.  \n\nIf LEFT to (7,1):  \nNext turn possible moves from (7,1):  \n- UP (7,2) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (7,0) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT (6,1) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (8,1) \u2013 my body (unsafe).  \nSo 3 safe follow-ups.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (9,1):  \nNext turn possible moves from (9,1):  \n- UP (9,2) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (9,0) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT (8,1) \u2013 my body (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT (10,1) \u2013 off board (unsafe).  \nSo 2 safe follow-ups.  \n\nSo DOWN gives immediate apple but reduces future safe moves to 2. LEFT gives 3 safe follow-ups and keeps me closer to center.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term safety vs. growth:**  \nI\u2019m length 2 vs enemy length 6. Need to grow but must avoid traps. Eating (8,0) puts me in bottom-right corner with only 2 exits, which could be dangerous if enemy approaches. Better to stay flexible.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Plan:**  \nGo LEFT to (7,1) to keep more options open, then aim for (5,3) or (1,1) while monitoring enemy. Avoid cornering myself.  \n\nLEFT",

That would put its head at (1,1) next to my path toward (1,1) apple, but I\u2019m not heading there immediately.  \nIf enemy eats (1,1), it will grow to length 7, making it longer and more dangerous.  \nBetter for me to aim for (5,3) and avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s likely path.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP and LEFT both keep flexibility and move toward (5,3).  \nLEFT moves me closer to (5,3) horizontally but also slightly closer to enemy\u2019s possible position after eating (1,1).  \nUP moves me toward (5,3) while staying farther from enemy\u2019s area.  \nUP also opens path to (0,6) or (0,2) later if needed.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s length advantage, I should avoid moving too close to its territory (left side).  \nUP seems slightly safer in terms of keeping distance from enemy while progressing toward (5,3).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (6,2), next turn consider moving toward (5,3) via LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT, depending on safety. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s position; if it moves toward (5,3), maybe switch target to (8,0) or (0,6). Avoid getting trapped.\n\nUP",

Looking at enemy body: [(0,1),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4)] \u2014 so (2,3) is free, (2,4) free.  \nSo enemy can reach (2,5) in 5 moves.  \nI can also reach in 5 moves.  \nBut enemy\u2019s head at (0,2) to (2,5) path: (1,2),(2,2) is its own body \u2014 actually (2,2) is in its body, so it can\u2019t go there. So enemy must go (0,3),(1,3),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5) \u2014 5 moves, but (1,3) is free.  \nSo both 5 moves away.  \nRisky to compete directly.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Alternative apple:**  \n(4,9) is far but less contested.  \nFrom (5,3) to (4,9): path north then west.  \nUP moves help.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN gives fewer safe follow-ups (2), so avoid.  \nUP or LEFT both give 3 safe follow-ups.  \nUP moves toward (4,9) and (0,6) generally.  \nLEFT moves toward (2,5) but also centralizes.  \nGiven enemy length advantage, I should grow but avoid head-on risk.  \nEnemy\u2019s possible move RIGHT to (1,2) brings it closer to my area if I go LEFT.  \nUP seems safer because enemy is on left side board, going UP to (0,3) moves away from me.  \nSo UP minimizes early encounter.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter UP to (5,4), consider moving toward (4,9) or (0,6) while keeping distance from enemy. Enemy likely heading to (0,6) via UP moves. I can take central apples later.  \n\n**Final move:** UP",

It will likely aim for (0,6) or (2,5).  \nFrom (1,3) to (2,5) is 3 moves: (2,3),(2,4),(2,5) \u2014 but (2,3) is free, (2,4) free.  \nFrom my position, moving LEFT toward (2,5) could bring me into conflict with enemy in 2\u20133 turns.  \nEnemy is longer (8 vs my 3), so head-on collision fatal for me.  \nBetter to avoid direct competition while enemy is forced north.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Apple strategy:**  \n(4,9) is north, reachable via UP moves.  \n(0,6) is northwest, but enemy heading there.  \n(2,5) is northwest, enemy may go there after (1,3).  \nGiven enemy\u2019s length, I should aim for apples away from its path: (4,9) is safer.  \nUP moves me toward (4,9) and keeps distance from enemy\u2019s likely path.\n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT gives fewer safe follow-ups \u2192 eliminate.  \nLEFT moves toward (2,5) but risks meeting enemy in a few turns.  \nUP moves toward (4,9), gives 3 safe follow-ups, and avoids enemy\u2019s immediate trajectory.  \nUP is safest and positions me for growth without conflict.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter UP to (5,5), consider moving toward (4,9) via UP/LEFT while monitoring enemy\u2019s movement. Enemy forced UP this turn, so it will be at (1,3) next turn. Keep distance and avoid being trapped near walls.  \n\n**Final move:** UP",

Eating it now is optimal.  \nOther apples are far: (0,6) near enemy, (8,0), (9,0), (6,0) far.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \nIf UP to (4,9) and eat apple:  \nNext turn from (4,9) with length 4 (body: [(4,8),(4,7),(5,7)]):  \n- UP off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (4,8): my new body after growth (unsafe).  \n- LEFT (3,9): empty.  \n- RIGHT (5,9): empty.  \n\u2192 2 safe follow-ups (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nIf LEFT to (3,8):  \nNext turn from (3,8):  \n- UP (3,9): empty.  \n- DOWN (3,7): empty.  \n- LEFT (2,8): empty.  \n- RIGHT (4,8): my body (unsafe).  \n\u2192 3 safe follow-ups.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (5,8):  \nNext turn from (5,8):  \n- UP (5,9): empty.  \n- DOWN (5,7): my body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT (4,8): my body (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT (6,8): empty.  \n\u2192 2 safe follow-ups.  \n\nUP gives apple but reduces next-turn safe moves to 2. LEFT gives 3 safe moves but delays apple.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy threat path:**  \nEnemy at (2,6) could move UP to (2,7), then (2,8), possibly toward (4,9) area later.  \nIf I don\u2019t take (4,9) now, enemy could move toward it in 2 turns.  \nBest to secure apple now.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Plan after eating apple:**  \nAfter UP to (4,9) and growth, next turn I\u2019ll have only LEFT (3,9) and RIGHT (5,9) safe.  \nCheck which is better:  \n- LEFT (3,9): then possible moves: DOWN (3,8), LEFT (2,9), RIGHT (4,9) blocked.  \n- RIGHT (5,9): then possible moves: DOWN (5,8), LEFT (4,9) blocked, RIGHT (6,9).  \nBoth keep options open. I\u2019ll decide next turn based on enemy position.\n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP gets apple, increases my length to 4, keeps me alive, and enemy can\u2019t reach (4,9) before me.  \nEven though next turn\u2019s safe moves reduce to 2, that\u2019s acceptable after eating an apple.  \nAvoiding apple now risks enemy approaching and me losing it.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (4,9), next turn choose LEFT or RIGHT depending on which gives more space and avoids enemy. Enemy may move toward (0,6) or up toward (2,7). Monitor if enemy gets close to top row. After securing apple, consider moving toward (0,6) if enemy isn\u2019t there, else go toward bottom apples (6,0) or (8,0). Keep expanding safe space.\n\nUP",

Wait, after growth, tail end still at (4,7), so (3,8) is empty. Actually let\u2019s trace:  \nCurrent body: head (3,9), then (4,9),(4,8),(4,7).  \nIf I go LEFT to (2,9): new head (2,9), body becomes [(3,9),(4,9),(4,8),(4,7)].  \nNext turn DOWN to (2,8) and eat apple: new head (2,8), body becomes [(2,9),(3,9),(4,9),(4,8),(4,7)] \u2014 length 6.  \nFrom (2,8) after eating: UP (2,9) body, DOWN (2,7) empty, LEFT (1,8) empty, RIGHT (3,8) empty (since (3,8) not in body). So 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,8) then LEFT to (2,8):  \nCurrent body: head (3,9), then (4,9),(4,8),(4,7).  \nDOWN to (3,8): new head (3,8), body [(3,9),(4,9),(4,8),(4,7)].  \nNext turn LEFT to (2,8) and eat apple: new head (2,8), body [(3,8),(3,9),(4,9),(4,8),(4,7)] \u2014 length 6.  \nFrom (2,8) after eating: UP (2,9) empty? Wait, (2,9) not in body, so empty. DOWN (2,7) empty, LEFT (1,8) empty, RIGHT (3,8) body. So 3 safe moves again.  \n\nBoth sequences give same safe moves after eating.\n\n**Step 10 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s immediate move effect:**  \nIf enemy goes UP to (0,7), it\u2019s moving toward top row but still far from (2,8).  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (0,5), it\u2019s moving away from (2,8).  \nEither way, I have time.\n\n**Step 11 \u2013 Tie-breaker:**  \nFrom (2,9) I have LEFT to (1,9) as an escape if needed next turn.  \nFrom (3,8) I have DOWN to (3,7) as escape.  \nBoth fine.  \nBut going LEFT to (2,9) keeps me closer to the top-left corner, which might limit future options if enemy approaches.  \nGoing DOWN to (3,8) leaves me more central.  \nGiven enemy is at (0,6), moving toward (2,9) might put me closer to enemy\u2019s possible upward path. Safer to go DOWN to (3,8) first, then approach apple from the right.\n\n**Step 12 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN to (3,8) is slightly safer because it doesn\u2019t move me directly adjacent to the top wall and keeps more space between me and enemy\u2019s possible upward move.  \nFrom (3,8) I can still get the apple next turn if safe.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,8), if enemy is not threatening (2,8), go LEFT to eat apple. If enemy is moving toward (2,8) (e.g., enemy went UP to (0,7) and then RIGHT to (1,7)), I might avoid and go DOWN to (3,7) to stay safe and target other apples later.\n\nDOWN",

Risky.  \n\nIf DOWN to (2,7):  \nFrom (2,7) next turn:  \n- UP (2,8): my body (unsafe).  \n- DOWN (2,6): enemy body at (2,6) (unsafe).  \n- LEFT (1,7): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,7): empty.  \n\u2192 2 safe follow-ups (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nIf LEFT to (1,8):  \nFrom (1,8) next turn:  \n- UP (1,9): empty.  \n- DOWN (1,7): empty.  \n- LEFT (0,8): enemy head currently there but will move; could be empty or enemy body next turn.  \n- RIGHT (2,8): my body (unsafe).  \n\u2192 2 safe follow-ups (UP, DOWN), possibly 3 if enemy leaves (0,8).  \nBut risk of head-on collision this turn if enemy goes RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid head-on risk:**  \nEnemy length 10 vs my length 5 \u2192 head-on collision kills us both, enemy wins because it has more apples (9 vs 5). So I must avoid (1,8) unless I\u2019m sure enemy won\u2019t go RIGHT.  \nEnemy\u2019s options: UP (0,9) or RIGHT (1,8).  \nIf enemy is rational, it will avoid head-on with me too, because it has more to lose (it\u2019s winning). But if it goes RIGHT, it risks dying if I go LEFT.  \nGiven enemy\u2019s body layout, (0,9) is safe and open. It might prefer UP to avoid risk. But I can\u2019t rely on that.  \nBest to eliminate LEFT due to risk.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Compare UP vs DOWN:**  \nUP (2,9) \u2192 only 1 safe follow-up next turn (traps me).  \nDOWN (2,7) \u2192 2 safe follow-ups, moves toward center, away from enemy.  \nDOWN is safer for future options.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is long and blocks bottom-left area. I need to maneuver toward apples on right/bottom while keeping space.  \nFrom (2,7) I can go LEFT to (1,7) or RIGHT to (3,7) next turn, then toward (5,4) or (8,3).  \nAvoid top row where I get trapped.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN to (2,7) \u2013 avoids head-on risk, keeps options open, moves toward center/apples.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,7), check enemy\u2019s new head position. Likely move LEFT to (1,7) or RIGHT to (3,7) to open path toward (5,4). Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s long body in bottom-left.  \n\nDOWN",

If I move RIGHT to (4,7) and enemy moves RIGHT to (2,7), no collision.  \nSo both DOWN and RIGHT are safe from head-on.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (5,4) \u2014 Manhattan distance from (3,7) = |5-3|+|4-7| = 2+3=5.  \nFrom (3,6) distance to (5,4) = 2+2=4.  \nFrom (4,7) distance to (5,4) = 1+3=4.  \nBoth equally closer by 1 step.  \n(8,3) is farther.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \nIf DOWN to (3,6):  \nFrom (3,6) next turn:  \n- UP (3,7): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (3,5): empty.  \n- LEFT (2,6): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (4,6): empty.  \n\u2192 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nIf RIGHT to (4,7):  \nFrom (4,7) next turn:  \n- UP (4,8): empty.  \n- DOWN (4,6): empty.  \n- LEFT (3,7): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (5,7): empty.  \n\u2192 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nRIGHT gives more options next turn.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy will die this turn, so I will be alone on board after this move. Then I can freely collect apples.  \nBut I must avoid trapping myself later.  \nFrom (4,7) I have more open space toward right side and top.  \nFrom (3,6) I\u2019m closer to bottom apples but more constrained by enemy\u2019s corpse (body remains).  \n\nSince enemy dies, I should prioritize keeping maximum mobility to navigate around its long body.  \nRIGHT opens more space toward center-right.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nBoth moves safe, but RIGHT gives more follow-up options.  \nWith enemy dead, I just need to avoid hitting its static body and plan efficient apple collection.  \nRIGHT moves me toward (5,4) and (8,3) while keeping open space.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nEnemy will be dead. Collect apples efficiently: first (5,4), then (8,3), then bottom apples. Avoid running into enemy\u2019s corpse. Keep space to loop around.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board state and analyzing my options:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (1, 7), body at (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), 9 apples collected\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (3, 7), body at (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), 4 apples\n- 5 apples available: (8, 0), (9, 0), (6, 0), (5, 4), (8, 3)\n- It's turn 33/150\n\n**Evaluating each direction:**\n\n**UP (to (1, 8)):**\n- **ELIMINATED** - moving into my own body at (1, 8) (would create a collision)\n\n**DOWN (to (1, 6)):**\n- **ELIMINATED** - moving into my own body at (1, 6) (would create a collision)\n\n**LEFT (to (0, 7)):**\n- **ELIMINATED** - moving into my own body at (0, 7) (would create a collision)\n\n**RIGHT (to (2, 7)):**\n- **ELIMINATED** - enemy snake's body is at (2, 7) (would create a collision)\n\nWait, this can't be right. Let me re-examine the board more carefully. All four directions seem blocked. Let me trace through each position:\n\nMy head is at (1, 7)\n- UP: (1, 8) - my body segment\n- DOWN: (1, 6) - my body segment  \n- LEFT: (0, 7) - my body segment\n- RIGHT: (2, 7) - enemy body segment\n\nAll moves lead to collision. This appears to be a deadly situation where I'm completely boxed in. However, I need to verify if there's ANY safe move available, or if I missed something.\n\nLet me double-check the board state. According to the board:\n- At position (1, 8): T (my tail/body)\n- At position (0, 7): T (my tail/body)\n- At position (1, 6): T (my tail/body)\n- At position (2, 7): T (enemy body)\n\nUnfortunately, all four directions from (1, 7) are indeed blocked. This appears to be an unavoidable death situation. Since all moves result in collision, and I must choose one, I'll select the move that might give the highest chance of the enemy dying first or some other miracle.\n\nActually, let me reconsider if any of these positions might free up due to simultaneous movement. The tail end of my snake might move if I'm growing, but I didn't eat an apple last turn, so my tail stays put.\n\nSince I must choose a direction and all appear equally fatal, I'll choose RIGHT in hopes that perhaps the enemy snake moves away from (2, 7) this turn, though this is extremely unlikely.\n\n**Future plan:** If by some miracle I survive this turn, prioritize getting away from crowded areas and toward open spaces near the apples at (8, 3) or (5, 4).\n\nRIGHT",
