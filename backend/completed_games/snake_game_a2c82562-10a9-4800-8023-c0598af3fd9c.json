Hmm, I need to decide which one to go for. The closest one to me is (2,3), which is directly below me. That's four units down. But wait, moving down from (2,9) would take me to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6), and so on. Oh, wait, there's an apple at (2,6). So if I go down four times, I can reach that apple. But I should check if there are any obstacles or enemies in the way.\n\nSnake #1 is at (9,5), which is on the opposite side of the board. So it's not near me right now. That's good because I don't have to worry about colliding with it immediately. My main concern is the walls and making sure I don't run into myself, but since my body is empty, that's not an issue yet.\n\nIf I go down towards (2,6), I can eat that apple and grow. That would give me a point and make my snake longer. Alternatively, I could look at other apples, but (2,3) is also on the same x-coordinate as me, so maybe I can go for that after (2,6). But let's focus on the nearest one first.\n\nWait, (2,6) is four units down from me. So moving down four times would get me there. Let me visualize the path. From (2,9) to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6). That's three moves. So in the next move, I should start moving down.\n\nBut I should also check if there are any other apples closer. Let me see the positions again.

That's near the top left corner, right? My body is empty, so I'm just a single segment right now.\n\nLooking at the apples, they're at (7,7), (3,5), (1,1), (2,3), and (2,6). Hmm, I need to decide which one to go for. The closest one to me is (2,3), which is directly below me. That's four units down. But wait, moving down from (2,9) would take me to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6), and so on. Oh, wait, there's an apple at (2,6). So if I go down four times, I can reach that apple. But I should check if there are any obstacles or enemies in the way.\n\nSnake #1 is at (9,5), which is on the opposite side of the board. So it's not near me right now. That's good because I don't have to worry about colliding with it immediately. My main concern is the walls and making sure I don't run into myself, but since my body is empty, that's not an issue yet.\n\nIf I go down towards (2,6), I can eat that apple and grow. That would give me a point and make my snake longer. Alternatively, I could look at other apples, but (2,3) is also on the same x-coordinate as me, so maybe I can go for that after (2,6). But let's focus on the nearest one first.\n\nWait, (2,6) is four units down from me. So moving down four times would get me there. Let me visualize the path. From (2,9) to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6). That's three moves. So in the next move, I should start moving down.\n\nBut I should also check if there are any other apples closer. Let me see the positions again. (1,1) is far away, (3,5) is a bit to the right and down, (7,7) is way to the right. So (2,6) is the closest. So moving down makes sense.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats, so I think moving down is the best move. I'll go down to (2,8) next. Then, I can continue down towards the apple at (2,6). Once I eat that, I'll have to decide whether to go for another apple or maybe block the enemy snake, but for now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nSo my next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nTo move towards the closest apple at (2,6), I'll start by moving down.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

That's near the top left corner, right? My body is empty, so I'm just a single segment right now.\n\nLooking at the apples, they're at (7,7), (3,5), (1,1), (2,3), and (2,6). Hmm, I need to decide which one to go for. The closest one to me is (2,3), which is directly below me. That's four units down. But wait, moving down from (2,9) would take me to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6), and so on. Oh, wait, there's an apple at (2,6). So if I go down four times, I can reach that apple. But I should check if there are any obstacles or enemies in the way.\n\nSnake #1 is at (9,5), which is on the opposite side of the board. So it's not near me right now. That's good because I don't have to worry about colliding with it immediately. My main concern is the walls and making sure I don't run into myself, but since my body is empty, that's not an issue yet.\n\nIf I go down towards (2,6), I can eat that apple and grow. That would give me a point and make my snake longer. Alternatively, I could look at other apples, but (2,3) is also on the same x-coordinate as me, so maybe I can go for that after (2,6). But let's focus on the nearest one first.\n\nWait, (2,6) is four units down from me. So moving down four times would get me there. Let me visualize the path. From (2,9) to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6). That's three moves. So in the next move, I should start moving down.\n\nBut I should also check if there are any other apples closer. Let me see the positions again. (1,1) is far away, (3,5) is a bit to the right and down, (7,7) is way to the right. So (2,6) is the closest. So moving down makes sense.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats, so I think moving down is the best move. I'll go down to (2,8) next. Then, I can continue down towards the apple at (2,6). Once I eat that, I'll have to decide whether to go for another apple or maybe block the enemy snake, but for now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nSo my next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nTo move towards the closest apple at (2,6), I'll start by moving down.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

That's near the top left corner, right? My body is empty, so I'm just a single segment right now.\n\nLooking at the apples, they're at (7,7), (3,5), (1,1), (2,3), and (2,6). Hmm, I need to decide which one to go for. The closest one to me is (2,3), which is directly below me. That's four units down. But wait, moving down from (2,9) would take me to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6), and so on. Oh, wait, there's an apple at (2,6). So if I go down four times, I can reach that apple. But I should check if there are any obstacles or enemies in the way.\n\nSnake #1 is at (9,5), which is on the opposite side of the board. So it's not near me right now. That's good because I don't have to worry about colliding with it immediately. My main concern is the walls and making sure I don't run into myself, but since my body is empty, that's not an issue yet.\n\nIf I go down towards (2,6), I can eat that apple and grow. That would give me a point and make my snake longer. Alternatively, I could look at other apples, but (2,3) is also on the same x-coordinate as me, so maybe I can go for that after (2,6). But let's focus on the nearest one first.\n\nWait, (2,6) is four units down from me. So moving down four times would get me there. Let me visualize the path. From (2,9) to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6). That's three moves. So in the next move, I should start moving down.\n\nBut I should also check if there are any other apples closer. Let me see the positions again. (1,1) is far away, (3,5) is a bit to the right and down, (7,7) is way to the right. So (2,6) is the closest. So moving down makes sense.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats, so I think moving down is the best move. I'll go down to (2,8) next. Then, I can continue down towards the apple at (2,6). Once I eat that, I'll have to decide whether to go for another apple or maybe block the enemy snake, but for now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nSo my next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nTo move towards the closest apple at (2,6), I'll start by moving down.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

Hmm, I need to decide which one to go for. The closest one to me is (2,3), which is directly below me. That's four units down. But wait, moving down from (2,9) would take me to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6), and so on. Oh, wait, there's an apple at (2,6). So if I go down four times, I can reach that apple. But I should check if there are any obstacles or enemies in the way.\n\nSnake #1 is at (9,5), which is on the opposite side of the board. So it's not near me right now. That's good because I don't have to worry about colliding with it immediately. My main concern is the walls and making sure I don't run into myself, but since my body is empty, that's not an issue yet.\n\nIf I go down towards (2,6), I can eat that apple and grow. That would give me a point and make my snake longer. Alternatively, I could look at other apples, but (2,3) is also on the same x-coordinate as me, so maybe I can go for that after (2,6). But let's focus on the nearest one first.\n\nWait, (2,6) is four units down from me. So moving down four times would get me there. Let me visualize the path. From (2,9) to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6). That's three moves. So in the next move, I should start moving down.\n\nBut I should also check if there are any other apples closer. Let me see the positions again. (1,1) is far away, (3,5) is a bit to the right and down, (7,7) is way to the right. So (2,6) is the closest. So moving down makes sense.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats, so I think moving down is the best move. I'll go down to (2,8) next. Then, I can continue down towards the apple at (2,6).

Hmm, I need to decide which one to go for. The closest one to me is (2,3), which is directly below me. That's four units down. But wait, moving down from (2,9) would take me to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6), and so on. Oh, wait, there's an apple at (2,6). So if I go down four times, I can reach that apple. But I should check if there are any obstacles or enemies in the way.\n\nSnake #1 is at (9,5), which is on the opposite side of the board. So it's not near me right now. That's good because I don't have to worry about colliding with it immediately. My main concern is the walls and making sure I don't run into myself, but since my body is empty, that's not an issue yet.\n\nIf I go down towards (2,6), I can eat that apple and grow. That would give me a point and make my snake longer. Alternatively, I could look at other apples, but (2,3) is also on the same x-coordinate as me, so maybe I can go for that after (2,6). But let's focus on the nearest one first.\n\nWait, (2,6) is four units down from me. So moving down four times would get me there. Let me visualize the path. From (2,9) to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6). That's three moves. So in the next move, I should start moving down.\n\nBut I should also check if there are any other apples closer. Let me see the positions again. (1,1) is far away, (3,5) is a bit to the right and down, (7,7) is way to the right. So (2,6) is the closest. So moving down makes sense.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats, so I think moving down is the best move. I'll go down to (2,8) next. Then, I can continue down towards the apple at (2,6).

Hmm, I need to decide which one to go for. The closest one to me is (2,3), which is directly below me. That's four units down. But wait, moving down from (2,9) would take me to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6), and so on. Oh, wait, there's an apple at (2,6). So if I go down four times, I can reach that apple.

That's good because I don't have to worry about colliding with it immediately. My main concern is the walls and making sure I don't run into myself, but since my body is empty, that's not an issue yet.\n\nIf I go down towards (2,6), I can eat that apple and grow. That would give me a point and make my snake longer. Alternatively, I could look at other apples, but (2,3) is also on the same x-coordinate as me, so maybe I can go for that after (2,6). But let's focus on the nearest one first.\n\nWait, (2,6) is four units down from me. So moving down four times would get me there. Let me visualize the path. From (2,9) to (2,8), then (2,7), (2,6). That's three moves. So in the next move, I should start moving down.\n\nBut I should also check if there are any other apples closer. Let me see the positions again.
