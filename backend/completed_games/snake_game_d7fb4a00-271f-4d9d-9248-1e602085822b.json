Enemy body is just head at (4, 6), so no.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n2. DOWN (2, 4):  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - No body collision.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n3. LEFT (1, 5):  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - Apple at (1, 5)? Yes \u2192 would eat apple and grow to length 2 next turn.  \n   - No body collision now.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n4. RIGHT (3, 5):  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - No apple there.  \n   - No body collision.  \n   - Safe.  \n\nAll four moves are safe immediately.  \n\n**Consider enemy movement:**  \nEnemy at (4, 6) could move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3, 6), that\u2019s not a threat to me this turn unless I move to (3, 6) \u2014 I\u2019m not.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (4, 5), still not a threat to me this turn unless I go to (4, 5) \u2014 I\u2019m not.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT twice? No, only one move.  \n\nSo no head-on collision risk this turn regardless of my move.  \n\n**Strategic choice:**  \nEating an apple early is good \u2014 gives length advantage and score.  \nLEFT to (1, 5) gets an apple immediately.  \nAfter eating, my body will be [(1, 5), (2, 5)] next turn, so my tail is at (2, 5).  \n\nPotential risk: after moving LEFT to (1, 5), my head is at apple cell, enemy is at (4, 6). Next turn I\u2019ll have to avoid moving back into (2, 5) unless I have another safe move. But I\u2019ll have 3 possible moves from (1, 5) except possibly one blocked by my own tail at (2, 5) \u2014 that\u2019s only DOWN from (1, 5) to (1, 4) and UP to (1, 6) and LEFT to (0, 5) and RIGHT to (2, 5) but RIGHT is into my tail so not allowed. So next turn from (1, 5) I\u2019ll have UP, DOWN, LEFT safe (if no enemy there). That\u2019s fine.  \n\nOther moves without apple:  \nUP to (2, 6) \u2014 moves away from most apples except maybe (7, 7) far.  \nDOWN to (2, 4) \u2014 moves toward apple at (3, 1) but far.  \nRIGHT to (3, 5) \u2014 neutral.  \n\nBest is LEFT to eat apple now.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (1, 5), avoid moving RIGHT into own tail next turn. Prefer UP or DOWN to open space, maybe toward another apple while keeping distance from enemy.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nLEFT",

Let\u2019s check:  \nFrom (1, 4) to (3, 1): dx = 2, dy = -3.  \nDOWN: (1, 3) \u2192 dx = 2, dy = -2 \u2192 Manhattan 4.  \nRIGHT: (2, 4) \u2192 dx = 1, dy = -3 \u2192 Manhattan 4.  \n\nBut DOWN gets me closer in y, which is good because (3, 1) is south.  \nRIGHT gets me closer in x but farther in y? Wait, from (2, 4) to (3, 1): dx = 1, dy = -3 \u2192 Manhattan 4.  \n\nActually both equal Manhattan distance next step.  \n\n**Future safety check:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (1, 3):  \nNext turn body = [(1, 3), (1, 4)], tail at (1, 4).  \nFrom (1, 3): UP (1, 4) is body (unsafe), DOWN (1, 2), LEFT (0, 3), RIGHT (2, 3) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 4):  \nNext turn body = [(2, 4), (1, 4)], tail at (1, 4).  \nFrom (2, 4): UP (2, 5), DOWN (2, 3), LEFT (1, 4) is body (unsafe), RIGHT (3, 4) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 4):  \nNext turn body = [(0, 4), (1, 4)], tail at (1, 4).  \nFrom (0, 4): UP (0, 5), DOWN (0, 3), LEFT off board (unsafe), RIGHT (1, 4) is body (unsafe) \u2192 only 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). That\u2019s worse for future flexibility.  \n\nSo eliminate LEFT.\n\n**Between DOWN and RIGHT:**  \nEnemy at (6, 6) is far, but going RIGHT moves slightly toward enemy\u2019s area, though not risky yet.  \nApple (6, 3) is east-south, but (3, 1) is closer.  \n\nI think DOWN is slightly better because:  \n1. It keeps me in a less crowded column (column 1 vs column 2), leaving more space to maneuver south toward (3, 1).  \n2. From (1, 3) next turn, I can go RIGHT to (2, 3) or DOWN to (1, 2) to continue toward apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 3), aim to go to (2, 3) or (1, 2) depending on safety, to approach (3, 1).

No immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- (6, 0) is reachable this turn via RIGHT.  \n- (9, 2) is 5 steps away from (5, 0), but 4 steps from (6, 0).  \n- (6, 3) is 3 steps from enemy head; enemy may go there.  \n\n**Decision factors:**  \nRIGHT gets an apple now, grows to length 5, but leaves only 2 safe moves next turn.  \nUP gives 2 safe moves next turn but no apple.  \n\nGiven enemy is length 4 like me, growing sooner could give advantage. Also, RIGHT moves toward board center slightly, while UP moves into a more open column but away from immediate apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I take RIGHT and eat apple, next turn from (6, 0) I can go UP to (6, 1) or RIGHT to (7, 0). I should avoid moving toward enemy if they go to (6, 3).  \n\nGiven safety is equal (both moves give 2 safe moves next turn), taking the apple now seems beneficial for score and eventual win condition.  \n\n**Move:**  \nRIGHT",

Next turn if I stay at (3, 8) and enemy goes UP to (3, 8), head-on collision.

However, they could potentially move toward the apple at (5, 9).\n\n**Apple proximity and strategy:**\n\nClosest apples: (5, 9) is nearby but would require moving toward the enemy. (8, 8) is further but also risky. (6, 2) and others are distant.\n\n**Future mobility analysis:**\n\n- **UP (to (3, 9))**: Next turn I could go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (backtracking)\n- **LEFT (to (2, 8))**: Next turn I could go UP, DOWN, or LEFT\n\nBoth moves preserve good mobility. UP moves me toward the top row where apples might spawn, while LEFT moves me away from the enemy.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n\nThe enemy has length 10 (9 apples + initial), while I have length 8. A head-on collision would kill us both, giving them the win due to higher apple count. I should avoid moving toward the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nPrioritize survival and collecting distant apples while avoiding the enemy. The apple at (0, 5) is relatively safe but requires careful navigation through my body. Consider moving leftward to create distance from enemy #1, then plan route to (0, 5) or (6, 2).\n\nLEFT",

Wait, apple at (5, 9) still there now. If I go UP to (6, 9), apple (5, 9) remains unless enemy eats it? Enemy can\u2019t reach (5, 9) this turn from (3, 8). So next turn, (5, 9) still there unless enemy moves toward it later.) Actually, check: enemy at (3, 8) can\u2019t reach (5, 9) in 1 move. So apple stays.  \n   - RIGHT: (7, 9) empty.  \n\n   So next turn from (6, 9) safe moves: LEFT (to apple), RIGHT. Only 2 safe moves, and one is into apple (which grows me but reduces next-turn options further). Top edge is limiting.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 7):**  \n   Next turn from (6, 7):  \n   - UP: (6, 8) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n   - DOWN: (6, 6) empty.  \n   - LEFT: (5, 7) empty.  \n   - RIGHT: (7, 7) empty.  \n\n   3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).

Good.\n\n---\n\n**Apple considerations:**  \nClosest apple to me now: (5, 9) is 1 step away (UP then LEFT from my head, but not directly reachable in 1 move from (6, 8)).  \nFrom (6, 8), no apple in 1 move except if I go RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8), then next turn RIGHT \u2192 (8, 8) apple.  \nOr DOWN \u2192 (6, 7) then later toward (6, 2).  \n\nBut (5, 9) is risky to go for because:  \nTo get it, I\u2019d need to go UP to (6, 9), then LEFT to (5, 9) next turn. That leaves me at top edge with fewer options after eating it.  \n\nBetter to keep flexibility and maybe let enemy take (5, 9)? Enemy at (3, 8) could go UP to (3, 9), then RIGHT to (4, 9), then RIGHT to (5, 9) in 3 turns. By then I could be elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter this move, consider path to (8, 8) apple or (6, 2) apple. Avoid trapping myself in corners. Enemy is shorter (length 8 vs my 10), so head-on collision kills them, but I should avoid risky ties. Keep central flexibility. Possibly go DOWN to open space near bottom apples later.\n\n---\n\n**Best move now:**  \nDOWN gives most next-move options and keeps me away from top edge. RIGHT also good but puts me closer to (8, 8) apple next turn, which is fine, but maybe better to keep apple as future option while exploring open space.  \n\nActually, RIGHT to (7, 8) sets up for (8, 8) apple next turn safely, and still leaves UP/DOWN options after that. DOWN to (6, 7) leaves all directions except UP open next turn.  \n\nBoth are safe. I\u2019ll choose DOWN to move toward center and keep more symmetric options.\n\nDOWN",

Continuing to avoid confrontation is wise. Moving LEFT positions me better for reaching (0, 5) while keeping distance from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nHead toward the apple at (0, 5) via LEFT/DOWN moves.

The enemy is occupied with apples on the right side of the board.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue heading toward the apple at (0, 5) via DOWN moves.

From (8, 9), I can go LEFT to (7, 9) or DOWN to (8, 8) (but (8, 8) will be empty next turn after I move, so that\u2019s safe). Actually, let\u2019s check:  \nFrom (9, 9) \u2192 LEFT to (8, 9).  \nFrom (8, 9):  \nUP off board \u2192 no.  \nDOWN to (8, 8) \u2192 will be empty next turn (my old head moved to (9, 9), so (8, 8) is now tail end? Wait, check body: my tail is (5, 6), so (8, 8) is second segment now, but after I move UP to (9, 9), body becomes [(8, 8), (8, 7), ...], so (8, 8) is still body next turn. So DOWN from (8, 9) to (8, 8) is unsafe. LEFT to (7, 9) safe, RIGHT to (9, 9) body unsafe. So from (8, 9) only LEFT safe. That\u2019s a narrow path along top row.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (9, 7), next turn only DOWN to (9, 6) safe. From (9, 6), I can go DOWN to (9, 5) or LEFT to (8, 6) (check body: (8, 7) is body, (8, 6) empty). That gives more options.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s simulate:  \nCurrent body: head (9,8), then (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), ...  \nIf I go DOWN to (9,7): new body: head (9,7), then (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), ... tail (5,6).  \nNext turn from (9,7): DOWN to (9,6) safe (empty).  \nFrom (9,6):  \nUP to (9,7) body \u2192 no.  \nDOWN to (9,5) empty.  \nLEFT to (8,6) empty.  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 no.  \nSo 2 safe moves from (9,6). That\u2019s better than the UP path which forces me along top edge with fewer options.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDOWN to (9,7) gives a path toward (7,5) apple, and next turn DOWN to (9,6) gives options DOWN or LEFT afterward.

They may be heading for the apple at (7, 0) or (9, 2).\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\n\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (7, 5). Their possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (7, 6): Empty \u2192 safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 4): Empty \u2192 safe\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 5): Empty \u2192 safe\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 5): Their own body \u2192 unsafe\n\nThey have UP, DOWN, LEFT as safe moves.

Higher collision risk with enemy.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\n\nStill behind on apples (8 vs 11). Need to prioritize safe apple collection. The enemy is larger and more dangerous. UP toward (5, 9) seems safest while maintaining options. Avoid direct confrontation with the larger enemy snake.\n\nUP",

Wait \u2014 actually, when you eat an apple, you grow immediately next turn, so the tail stays in place for one extra turn. This turn (turn 39) I just moved onto (7, 5) and ate apple, so my body length is now 12, but tail stays at (5, 8) until after this turn\u2019s movement? Let\u2019s clarify:  \nIn Snake, after eating an apple, the snake grows by 1 at the end of the turn (so tail doesn\u2019t move that turn). So my body length is 12 now, but tail is still (5, 8) until next turn\u2019s movement. So body list given is still old length 11? No \u2014 the given body in the current state is after last turn\u2019s move and growth?

But that\u2019s a future consideration.  \n\nActually, enemy could also go DOWN to (4, 4) or UP to (4, 6), so not necessarily moving toward me.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nI\u2019m longer than enemy (12 vs 9). Avoid head-on collisions since I\u2019d die too. Favor moves that keep space open. The bottom-left area (around (6,2), (7,0)) is less crowded. My body is mostly top-right. Going LEFT or DOWN opens more options.  \n\nLEFT seems slightly better \u2014 closer to (6,2) apple and keeps more central space. After LEFT to (6,5), next turn I can go DOWN to (6,4) toward (6,2) or (7,0), or LEFT to (5,5) toward (5,9).  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Enemy could go RIGHT to (5, 6) this turn, so next turn it could be enemy body or head.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 6): empty.  \nActually, if enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 6) this turn, then (5, 6) is enemy head now, so next turn it could move away, leaving body? Wait, enemy\u2019s body after moving RIGHT: head (5, 6), body: [(4, 6), (4, 5), ...]. So (5, 6) is enemy head now, so next turn (5, 6) might be enemy body if enemy moves away. So (5, 6) could be unsafe next turn.  \nThus from (6, 6) next turn, only RIGHT might be safe, possibly only 1 safe move \u2014 risky.  \n\n**DOWN to (6, 4):**  \nNext turn from (6, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 5): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 3): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 4): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 4): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.

If enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 6) this turn, then (5, 6) is enemy head now, so next turn it\u2019s enemy body. So unsafe next turn.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 4): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 5): enemy body now? Currently enemy body has (4, 5) \u2014 yes, enemy\u2019s second segment. After enemy moves, (4, 5) remains body unless enemy grows. So (4, 5) is unsafe next turn.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 5): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only DOWN might be safe next turn \u2014 risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (6, 5):  \n- (6, 2) is 3 steps down.  \n- (7, 0) is down 5, right 1.  \n- (5, 9) is left 1, up 4.  \n- (9, 2) and (1, 9) are farther.  \n\nClosest is (6, 2).  \n\n---\n\n**Comparison:**  \nUP \u2192 risky next turn (maybe 1 safe move).  \nLEFT \u2192 risky next turn (maybe 1 safe move).  \nDOWN \u2192 3 safe moves next turn, moves toward closest apple (6, 2).  \n\nEnemy at (4, 6) is not threatening immediate collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nGo DOWN to (6, 4) to keep options open and approach (6, 2) apple. From there, can go DOWN again to (6, 3) or LEFT/RIGHT to avoid trapping. Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s area (left side) until necessary.  \n\nDOWN",

The apple at (1, 9) is far left and up. Enemy snake is at (6, 4) with their body wrapping around the right side. They may be heading for (7, 0) or (9, 2).\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\n\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (6, 4). Their possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (6, 5): Their own body \u2192 unsafe\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 3): Empty \u2192 safe  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 4): Empty \u2192 safe\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 4): Empty \u2192 safe\n\nThey have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT as safe moves. If they move LEFT to (5, 4), they'll be closer to my position but not immediately threatening.\n\n**Future mobility analysis:**\n\n- **UP (to (4, 8))**: Next turn options: UP (to (4, 9)), DOWN (back), RIGHT (to (5, 8)), LEFT (to (3, 8)) \u2192 3 safe moves. Gets me closer to (5, 9).\n- **LEFT (to (3, 7))**: Next turn options: UP (to (3, 8)), DOWN (to (3, 6)), LEFT (to (2, 7)), RIGHT (back) \u2192 3 safe moves. Takes me away from most apples.\n- **RIGHT (to (5, 7))**: Next turn options: UP (to (5, 8)), DOWN (to (5, 6)), RIGHT (to (6, 7)), LEFT (back) \u2192 3 safe moves. Higher collision risk with enemy if they move UP/LEFT.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\n\nStill behind on apples (8 vs 11). Need to prioritize safe apple collection while avoiding the larger enemy. UP toward (5, 9) remains optimal - it maintains distance from the enemy while progressing toward an apple. The enemy is likely to move toward the apples on their side of the board.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue moving UP/RIGHT toward (5, 9) while monitoring enemy movement. Avoid direct confrontation. If enemy moves toward me, consider LEFT/DOWN options to create space.\n\nUP",

(1, 9) is closer but requires moving left/down. (2, 6) is closer to my body segments but requires careful navigation. The enemy snake is at (7, 2) and is closer to apples (9, 2) and (7, 0).\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\n\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (7, 2). Their possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (7, 3): Empty \u2192 safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 1): Empty \u2192 safe\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 2): Their own body \u2192 unsafe\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 2): Empty \u2192 safe\n\nThey have 3 safe moves and are far from my position.

The apple at (2, 6) is also accessible but requires navigating around my own body. RIGHT keeps me near the top edge but doesn't lead directly to apples. DOWN gives me more central positioning and better access to multiple apples.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move DOWN to maintain mobility, then head toward (1, 9) or (2, 6) while avoiding the enemy's likely path toward the right-side apples.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT puts me closest to (9, 2) next turn.  \n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy is far away (top row). No immediate danger.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (7, 1), next turn I can eat (7, 0) safely (unless enemy moves there, but enemy is far). That grows me and opens space toward bottom-left. My long body is mostly top-right, so moving down helps avoid trapping myself in the crowded top-right corner. After eating (7, 0), I can consider moving left toward (1, 1) or up toward (2, 6). Keep away from enemy\u2019s possible path (top row).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDOWN gives 3 safe moves next turn and immediate apple proximity. RIGHT also gives 3 safe moves and apple proximity, but (9, 2) is near the right wall, which could limit future moves. DOWN toward the open bottom-left seems better for long-term flexibility.  \n\nDOWN",

From (6, 7), it\u2019s 3 steps from my head if I go UP to (8, 2). Not immediate.  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nMy body blocks left and top-right area. I should avoid getting trapped near edges. UP to (8, 2) lets me eat (9, 2) next turn, but leaves only 2 safe moves after that. DOWN to (8, 0) also leaves 2 safe moves. RIGHT to (9, 1) also leaves 2 safe moves. All three have equal immediate safe follow-ups.  \n\nBut UP to (8, 2) is closer to apple (9, 2) and keeps me away from enemy\u2019s likely path (enemy moving down/right). Also, from (8, 2) I can go UP to (8, 3) after eating apple, opening more central space.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP gives a clear path to nearest apple next turn while avoiding enemy\u2019s immediate zone. All safe moves have same next-turn safe count, so apple proximity decides.  \n\nUP",

Apple at (1, 1) is also accessible. Enemy snake is now at (8, 3) and will likely go for the (9, 2) apple or potentially move toward center.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (8, 3). Their possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (8, 4): Empty \u2192 safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 2): Their own body \u2192 unsafe  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 3): Empty \u2192 safe\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 3): Empty \u2192 safe\n\nThey have UP, LEFT, and RIGHT as safe moves.

Takes me slightly further from the target apple but opens up more central territory.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\n\nStill behind (9 vs 12 apples). Need to prioritize collecting (2, 6) apple. DOWN is the most direct route toward this apple while maintaining safe distance from enemy. After collecting (2, 6), I can target (1, 1) or (1, 9).\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move DOWN toward (2, 6) apple. Next turn go LEFT to (4, 4), then continue LEFT/DOWN to approach the apple. This path keeps me safely away from the enemy who is on the right side of the board.\n\nDOWN",

LEFT is very limiting (only 1 safe move next). RIGHT gives 2 safe moves and positions me near (9, 2) apple next turn. Since I have a 3-apple lead, I should avoid moves that severely limit future options. LEFT is too risky. Between UP and RIGHT, RIGHT sets up an apple grab next turn while keeping decent mobility.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRIGHT to (9, 3) gives good next-turn options (UP, DOWN) and sets up for (9, 2) apple safely. Avoid LEFT (traps me).  \n\nRIGHT",

I can still get (9, 2) later if needed, but better to keep mobility with a 3-apple lead.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP is safer long-term; DOWN is greedy and risks getting stuck. With lead, prioritize survival and options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 4), consider moving LEFT toward center or UP if safe, to avoid being pinned on right edge.  \n\nUP",

Apple at (1, 1) is also accessible. Enemy snake is at (9, 4) and will likely go DOWN to (9, 3) or further to (9, 2) to eat that apple.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (9, 4). Their possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (9, 5): Empty \u2192 safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 3): Empty \u2192 safe (leads to apple at (9, 2))\n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 4): Empty \u2192 safe\n- RIGHT \u2192 Off board \u2192 unsafe\n\nThey have UP, DOWN, LEFT as safe moves.

LEFT is the most direct route toward (2, 6). After that, I can target (1, 1) or (1, 9).\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move LEFT toward (2, 6) apple. Next turn go DOWN to (3, 3), then LEFT to (2, 3), then UP to (2, 4), RIGHT to (2, 5), UP to (2, 6) to collect the apple. This path avoids potential conflict with enemy who will be on the right side.\n\nLEFT",

Need to choose the one that opens more options afterward.  \n- UP to (9,5) \u2192 next turn only UP to (9,6) safe, then from (9,6) maybe UP to (9,7) or LEFT to (8,6) if clear. But I\u2019m moving up along right edge, which could trap me.  \n- LEFT to (8,4) \u2192 next turn only LEFT to (7,4) safe, then from (7,4) I can go DOWN to (7,3) or LEFT to (6,4) (but (6,4) is my body currently \u2014 will it move away by then?). Actually, my tail is at (8,5), so as I move, my body shifts; (6,4) will still be part of my body next turn if I move LEFT now. Let\u2019s check:  \n  If I move LEFT to (8,4), my new body: head (8,4), then (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) \u2014 tail (7,5) is gone (since length 12, no apple eaten). So (6,4) still in body.  \n  So from (8,4) next turn, LEFT to (7,4) safe, then from (7,4) next turn: UP (7,5) will be empty (tail moved), DOWN (7,3) empty, LEFT (6,4) my body, RIGHT (8,4) old head. So 2 safe moves from (7,4) after that.  \n\nThus LEFT now gives a path to more space after 2 turns. UP now keeps me on edge longer.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLEFT to (8,4) is slightly better for future options after the next forced move.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,4), only safe move is LEFT to (7,4). Then from (7,4) aim to go DOWN toward (7,0) apple or LEFT toward center.  \n\nLEFT",

However, my body is at (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1) \u2014 so (9, 2) is adjacent to (8, 2) and (9, 3), but not blocked yet.  \n\nFrom (8, 6), path to (9, 2) is less direct: need to go RIGHT then DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term space:**  \nFrom (9, 7), I\u2019m on right edge, which limits future moves.  \nFrom (8, 6), I\u2019m more central, can go DOWN to (8, 5) then maybe LEFT/RIGHT.  \n\nBut my body occupies columns 7, 8, 9 in rows 1\u20138, so central area (left side) is more open.  \n\nActually, looking at board:  \nMy body blocks left side at col 7 in many rows. From (8, 6), going DOWN to (8, 5) is safe, then (8, 4) is body, so can\u2019t go UP later, but can go RIGHT to (9, 5) etc.  \n\nI think DOWN is slightly better because:  \n- It moves me toward bottom where apples (7, 0), (4, 1), (1, 1) are.  \n- Avoids right edge trap for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy is far away (left top), not an immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (8, 6), next turn likely go DOWN to (8, 5) if safe, then RIGHT to (9, 5), then DOWN toward (9, 2) apple, but need to check body positions as they shift. Alternative: after (8, 6) \u2192 (8, 5) \u2192 (9, 5) \u2192 (9, 4) is body, so must go (9, 5) \u2192 (9, 4) is unsafe next turn, so maybe go (9, 5) \u2192 (9, 6)? Actually (9, 4) is body now, so from (9, 5), DOWN to (9, 4) will be unsafe. So path to (9, 2) requires waiting for tail to move.  \n\nSafer to go DOWN now to (8, 6), then next turn maybe RIGHT to (9, 6) to stay flexible, then later approach apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN gives more future options toward bottom apples and avoids right-edge restriction.  \n\nDOWN",

DOWN moves me toward both apples. RIGHT keeps me on the top row but doesn't directly help with apple collection.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\n\nEnemy snake #1 at (8, 6) possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (8, 7): Their own body \u2192 unsafe\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 5): Empty \u2192 safe\n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 6): Their own body \u2192 unsafe\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 6): Empty \u2192 safe\n\nThey are closer to apple at (6, 6) and could also go for (9, 2). They have 12 apples vs my 11, so I need to be cautious about direct confrontation.\n\n**Future mobility analysis:**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2, 8)**: Next turn options: DOWN (to 2,7 - empty), LEFT (to 1,8 - my body), RIGHT (to 3,8 - empty) \u2192 2 safe moves\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3, 9)**: Next turn options: DOWN (to 3,8 - empty), LEFT (to 2,9 - my body) \u2192 1 safe move\n\nDOWN clearly provides better future mobility and moves me toward the cluster of apples at (4, 1) and (1, 1).\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\nI'm behind by 1 apple. I should prioritize the safer apples (4, 1) and (1, 1) rather than competing with the enemy for (6, 6). DOWN gives me better positioning to navigate toward these apples while maintaining mobility.

That\u2019s a dead end next turn.  \n\n**Option B: RIGHT to (9, 6)**  \nFrom (9, 6) next turn:  \n- UP (9, 7) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN (9, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (8, 6) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo from (9, 6) only UP and DOWN safe (2 options).  \n\nThus RIGHT is better for future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple in Manhattan distance:  \nFrom (8, 6):  \n- (9, 2): 1+4=5  \n- (6, 6): 2+0=2  \n- (4, 1): 4+5=9  \n- (7, 0): 1+6=7  \n- (1, 1): 7+5=12  \n\nFrom (9, 6):  \n- (9, 2): 0+4=4  \n- (6, 6): 3+0=3  \n- (4, 1): 5+5=10  \n- (7, 0): 2+6=8  \n- (1, 1): 8+5=13  \n\n(6, 6) is closest from both, but (6, 6) is adjacent to enemy body at (5, 6)? Wait, enemy body ends at (5, 5) and (5, 4)\u2026 Actually enemy body: (5, 5) is last in list, so (6, 6) is empty.  \n\nBut from (9, 6), to reach (6, 6) I\u2019d need LEFT 3 steps, but my body blocks at (7, 6) and (8, 6) after moving. So not immediately reachable without waiting.  \n\nFrom (8, 5), (6, 6) is 2 steps away but blocked by my body at (7, 6) and (7, 5).  \n\nSo (6, 6) is actually blocked for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nRIGHT to (9, 6) gives more next-turn options (UP/DOWN).  \nDOWN to (8, 5) traps me next turn (only RIGHT). That\u2019s risky if enemy moves toward me later.  \n\nApple at (9, 2) is reachable from (9, 6) by going DOWN repeatedly, but my body is at (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2). So path: (9, 6) \u2192 (9, 5) \u2192 (9, 4) is body next turn, so can\u2019t go there unless tail moves. Tail is at (8, 2), will move when I eat an apple or after turns.  \n\nSo maybe go RIGHT now, then next turn UP to (9, 7) to avoid dead end, then later approach apple when path clears.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy is far away, not immediate.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRIGHT is safer because it keeps 2 options next turn. DOWN leaves only 1 option next turn (dangerous).  \n\nRIGHT  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (9, 6), likely go UP to (9, 7) to stay flexible and avoid being forced into a corner, then work toward bottom apples once tail moves.  \n\nRIGHT",

This forces me to (9, 9) the turn after, then dead end.  \n\nDOWN to (9, 5) \u2192 only LEFT next turn \u2192 then at (8, 5) next turn:  \nFrom (8, 5):  \n- UP (8, 6) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (8, 4) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (7, 5) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (9, 5) \u2192 my body (old position) \u2192 unsafe.  \nActually, wait \u2014 at (8, 5) next turn, my body will have moved:  \nCurrent body: (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3)  \nIf I move DOWN to (9, 5) now, new head (9, 5), body becomes: (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3) \u2014 tail (8, 3) removed.  \n\nThen next turn if I go LEFT to (8, 5), body becomes: (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4) \u2014 tail (9, 3) removed.  \n\nCheck (8, 5) surroundings at that time:  \n- UP (8, 6) \u2192 body (8, 6) will be there \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (8, 4) \u2192 body (8, 4) will be there \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (7, 5) \u2192 body (7, 5) will be there \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (9, 5) \u2192 body (9, 5) will be there \u2192 unsafe.  \nYes, so (8, 5) will be completely surrounded by my own body next turn if I go DOWN now and LEFT next turn. That means DOWN now leads to certain death in 2 turns.  \n\nSo DOWN is worse than UP.  \n\nUP at least goes to (9, 7) \u2192 (9, 8) \u2192 (9, 9) \u2192 then at (9, 9) maybe tail moves enough to open LEFT later? But at (9, 9), only DOWN is possible next turn, which is (9, 8) \u2014 but that\u2019s body then. So UP path also dead end in 3 turns unless tail moves out of (8, 7) and (8, 8) by then.  \n\nTail will move each turn as I move (since not eating apple). Let\u2019s check:  \nCurrent tail: (8, 3)  \nAfter UP to (9, 7): tail becomes (9, 3)  \nAfter UP to (9, 8): tail becomes (8, 4)  \nAfter UP to (9, 9): tail becomes (9, 4)  \nAt that point, from (9, 9), possible moves:  \n- DOWN (9, 8) \u2192 body (9, 8) there \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (8, 9) \u2192 empty? Let\u2019s check body then:  \nBody will be: (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4) \u2014 yes (8, 9) is free. So at turn 3 from now, from (9, 9) LEFT to (8, 9) is safe.  \n\nSo UP path doesn\u2019t trap immediately; DOWN path traps in 2 moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Conclusion:**  \nUP is safer than DOWN because it doesn\u2019t lead to a surrounded situation in 2 turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (9, 7), go UP to (9, 8) to keep moving along top edge, then to (9, 9), then LEFT to (8, 9) to open space. Meanwhile, tail will clear lower rows, allowing eventual descent toward apples like (9, 2) when path is clear. Avoid moving toward enemy until necessary.  \n\nUP",

Focus on collecting apples while maintaining escape routes.\n\nRIGHT provides the best combination of apple proximity and future options.\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s check:  \n\nCurrent length = 13 segments. Moving without eating apple \u2192 length stays 13.  \nNew head (8, 9), then old body from (9, 9) down to (8, 4) is 12 more cells = total 13. Yes.  \n\nSo body: (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4). Tail is (8, 4) currently, but after move tail moves forward to (9, 4)? Wait, careful:  \n\nCurrent body list: head (9, 9), then:  \n1: (9, 8)  \n2: (9, 7)  \n3: (9, 6)  \n4: (8, 6)  \n5: (8, 7)  \n6: (8, 8)  \n7: (7, 8)  \n8: (7, 7)  \n9: (7, 6)  \n10: (7, 5)  \n11: (7, 4)  \n12: (8, 4) \u2190 tail  \n\nAfter moving LEFT to (8, 9):  \nNew head (8, 9), then old head (9, 9) becomes segment 1, then old segment 1 (9, 8) becomes segment 2, \u2026 up to old segment 11 (7, 4) becomes segment 12, and old tail (8, 4) is removed.  \n\nSo new body:  \n(8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4). Tail is (7, 4).  \n\nFrom (8, 9) next turn possible moves:  \n- UP (8, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN (8, 8) \u2192 my body (segment 7 in new body) \u2192 unsafe  \n- LEFT (7, 9) \u2192 empty  \n- RIGHT (9, 9) \u2192 my body (segment 1) \u2192 unsafe  \n\nSo only LEFT from (8, 9) next turn is safe. That means moving LEFT now leads to only one safe move next turn (LEFT again to (7, 9)).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n\nClosest apple: (9, 2) is far down column 9, blocked by my own body in column 9 from (9, 3) to (9, 9) after this move.  \n\n(6, 6) is near enemy, risky.  \n\n(7, 0) far.  \n\n(4, 1) far.  \n\n(1, 1) far.  \n\nSo no apple reachable immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \n\nOnly LEFT is safe now, but it leads to (8, 9) with only LEFT again next turn. That means I\u2019m being forced along top row leftwards. This is okay short-term because it keeps me alive and away from enemy.  \n\nEnemy is at (4, 7), might go for (6, 6) apple. I should continue left along top edge to (0, 9), then go down column 0 to approach apples (7, 0) or (1, 1) later.  \n\nNeed to watch enemy movement\u2014if enemy moves toward center, I can loop around top-left.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Conclusion:**  \n\nOnly LEFT is safe. It preserves life and follows a predictable top-edge path.  \n\nLEFT",

DOWN gives me more central positioning, while RIGHT puts me closer to the apple at (6, 6).\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\nI'm still behind by 1 apple. Both DOWN and RIGHT are strong. DOWN gives me access to (4, 1) and keeps central control. RIGHT gives me immediate access to (6, 6).
