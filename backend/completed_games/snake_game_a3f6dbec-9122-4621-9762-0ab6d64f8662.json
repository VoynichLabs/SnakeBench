Enemy #0 (head at 1,2) cannot reach (3,0) this turn, so there's no contest for that apple.\n- Taking the apple gives me the lead (5 vs 4) and grows my snake. There's no immediate head-on collision or body collision risk by moving DOWN.\n- UP or LEFT keep more lateral mobility but don't score immediately; RIGHT is illegal.\n- The main risk after eating is reduced maneuverability near the bottom if I get boxed in; but grabbing the free apple and increasing my score advantage is higher priority now.\n\nShort plan after this move:\n- Eat (3,0) now (DOWN). Next turn, prefer moving LEFT to head toward the apples at x=0\u20131 while avoiding being trapped against the left wall by the enemy. Keep routes open by not hugging the wall with my whole body; favor moves that preserve at least two escape options.\n\nDOWN",
