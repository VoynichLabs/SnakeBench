This is perfect - I can get my first point on this turn.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Apple at (4, 2) is 1 move away (LEFT)\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (3, 2) with body at [(2, 2)], so they're right next to the apple too\n- But since I'm at (5, 2) and the apple is at (4, 2), I can reach it in one move\n- The enemy snake would need to move RIGHT from (3, 2) to get to (4, 2)\n\nWait, I need to be careful here. The enemy snake is at (3, 2) and if they move RIGHT, they'll go to (4, 2) where the apple is. If I also move LEFT to (4, 2), we might collide! \n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. In simultaneous movement games, if we both move to the same square, we both die. But I need to get points to compete.\n\nHowever, looking at the enemy snake's position and body, they have their body at (2, 2) and head at (3, 2). If they move RIGHT to (4, 2), that would be a reasonable move for them to get the apple.\n\nI have a few options:\n1. Move LEFT to (4, 2) and risk collision if enemy also goes there\n2. Move UP to (5, 3) to avoid potential collision but miss the apple\n3. Move RIGHT to (6, 2) but that moves me away from apples\n4. Move DOWN to (5, 1) but that also doesn't help with apples\n\nThe risk is worth it - I need points to stay competitive. The enemy snake might not move toward the apple, and even if they do, I have an equal chance of getting it.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After getting the apple at (4, 2), I'll have my first point and can reassess the board. I'll then target the next closest apple while watching the enemy snake's movements.\n\nLEFT"
