Given its proximity and importance for growth, my priority is to reach that apple first. Since there are no immediate threats, I should focus on securing that fruit to gain a point and some breathing room.\n\nSnake #1 is at the bottom right, relatively far from me, so I don't need to worry about them for now. Instead, I'll consider the path ahead to (8, 3) and how my body will expand once I consume the apple.\n\nIf all goes well, I envision my snake shape shifting to [(8,2), (8,1), (8,0)] after the apple, gaining three segments. That would be a nice improvement in size and leverage for the next round.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn then is to stay focused on claiming the nearest apple before looking to navigate further. I need to trust my initial assessment: with the apple so close, it's the safest and most urgent step forward.\n\nWith that said, my next move is:\n\nRIGHT\n\nI'll aim to slide right into the apple at (8, 3) and start growing my body once more!",
