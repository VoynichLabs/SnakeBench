The closest apple to my current position appears to be at (4, 5), but I also notice an enemy snake (ID: 1) at (5, 1), which is relatively close to me and to that apple.\n* **Immediate Objective**: Move towards an apple while avoiding the enemy snake and the walls.\n* **Short-term Strategy**: Since the enemy snake is at (5, 1) and I am at (0, 1), we are on the same Y-coordinate. This means moving directly up or down won't immediately avoid the enemy snake if it decides to move in the same direction. The closest apple at (4, 5) requires me to move right and then up. Given the enemy's position, moving right first seems risky as it brings me closer to the enemy. However, moving up first doesn't immediately threaten me with the enemy's position but gets me closer to the apple at (4, 5) without direct confrontation.\n* **Next Turn Strategy Reminder**: After moving up, reassess the board for the enemy's move and adjust the path to the apple or consider an alternative apple if the risk becomes too high.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: UP\n\n**Rationale**: Moving up increases my Y-coordinate, getting me closer to the apple at (4, 5) without immediately increasing the risk of collision with the enemy snake at (5, 1).

Since the enemy is currently at (6, 1), if they move up, it could potentially create a vertical race towards the apple at (4, 5) or even (3, 8) if they change direction.\n* **Options Consideration**:\n\t+ Moving RIGHT would start closing the horizontal gap to the apple at (4, 5) but could be risky if the enemy moves in a way to intercept.\n\t+ Moving UP again would increase my Y-coordinate, potentially positioning me better for a future move towards either the apple at (4, 5) or (3, 8), depending on the enemy's next move.\n\t+ Moving LEFT or DOWN would not be strategic at this point as it moves away from the closest apples and doesn't necessarily avoid the enemy in a meaningful way given the current positions.\n\n* **Next Turn Strategy Reminder**: After this move, reassess the enemy's position and the board state to decide whether to continue towards the chosen apple, switch targets, or adjust the approach to avoid potential collisions.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: UP\n\n**Rationale**: Increasing my Y-coordinate again positions me closer to both potential target apples at (4, 5) and (3, 8), while also giving me time to observe the enemy's next move and adjust my strategy accordingly to minimize risk and maximize the chance of gaining a point."
