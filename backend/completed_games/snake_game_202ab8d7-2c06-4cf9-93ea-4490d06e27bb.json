The enemy snake is at (7, 7) with body at (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), and (7, 4).

It moves me closer to the apple at (2, 8), which is the closest apple to me\n2. Even though it could be risky if the enemy moves LEFT to (6, 7), the enemy would have to move LEFT to get there, and I would be moving DOWN\n3. The apple at (2, 8) is the closest apple to me and moving DOWN keeps me in a position to potentially reach it\n\nI'll choose DOWN.<|end_of_box|>\nDOWN",

UP: Moving from (0, 4) to (0, 5)\n   - This is a safe move (within board)\n   - Not into my own body\n   - Not into enemy body\n   - This would move me closer to the apple at (0, 1) which is below me\n\n2. DOWN: Moving from (0, 4) to (0, 3)\n   - This is a safe move (within board)\n   - Not into my own body\n   - Not into enemy body\n   - This would move me closer to the apple at (0, 1) which is below me\n\n3. LEFT: Moving from (0, 4) to (-1, 4)\n   - This would move me off the board\n   - This is an immediate death move, so I should avoid it\n\n4. RIGHT: Moving from (0, 4) to (1, 4)\n   - This is dangerous as (1, 4) is part of my own body\n   - This would cause me to collide with my own body and die\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Let's evaluate which is better:\n\nLooking at the enemy snake (ID 0) at (7, 5), it appears to be moving upward. The enemy snake might be moving up or left.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 3):\n- I'm moving away from the enemy snake\n- I'm moving closer to the apple at (0, 1), which is my nearest apple\n- I maintain a safe distance from the enemy\n- This keeps future options open as I can continue moving down toward the apple\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 5):\n- I'm also moving away from the enemy snake\n- But I'm moving away from the nearest apple at (0, 1)\n\nI think moving DOWN is the better choice as it:\n1. Keeps me safe from the enemy\n2. Moves me closer to the nearest apple at (0, 1)\n3. Maintains future options for continuing toward the apple\n\nSo my decision is to move DOWN.<|end_of_box|>\nDOWN",

LEFT is possible but would place you at (2,3) and risk soon getting trapped since (3,3) would then be behind you. RIGHT is safe but gives no immediate apple and constrains future moves (you\u2019d be unable to reverse and would have fewer safe continuations).\n- The immediate apple gain from DOWN is strong for progress, and although there\u2019s a potential head-on with the enemy at (3,1) if they also move UP to (3,2), such a collision could end with both snakes dead; you\u2019d still have the advantage in apples if that happens. Even without the collision, DOWN keeps you on a path toward more apples while maintaining options.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After consuming the apple by moving DOWN, look to peel toward the cluster of apples on the lower half of the board (e.g., y=0 area) while avoiding direct confrontations with the enemy head. Stay flexible to pivot to RIGHT if the path becomes blocked, but avoid reversing into your own neck to prevent accidental self-collision.\n\nDOWN",
