The upper right area has two apples clustered together (8, 9) and (7, 9), making it a good long-term target. This move:\n- Gets me closer to multiple apples in the upper right\n- Keeps me away from the enemy snake currently at (1, 6)\n- Maintains flexibility for future moves\n\nMoving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** would move me along the same row as the enemy, which could create collision risks later.\n\nMoving **DOWN** takes me away from most apples.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:** Focus on the upper-right cluster of apples at (8, 9) and (7, 9). Move up and right to collect these before the enemy can react. Once I have a few apples and length, I can control the board better.\n\nUP",

This opens up the bottom of the board, giving me flexibility.\n- **LEFT** to (8, 3): Moves me toward apples at (7, 4) and (6, 2). This could be good for pursuing the nearby cluster.\n\nThe apple at (6, 2) is the closest reachable apple. Moving LEFT gets me closer to it more directly (from (9, 3) \u2192 (8, 3) puts me 2 moves away horizontally and 1 move away vertically).\n\nMoving DOWN keeps me on the right edge but doesn't advance toward any apple efficiently.\n\nLEFT is the better strategic move because it positions me to grab (6, 2) next turn and maintains options. After (6, 2), I can easily reach (7, 4).\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. Move LEFT to (8, 3)\n2. Continue LEFT toward (6, 2)\n3. Collect (6, 2), then pursue (7, 4)\n4. Keep distance from enemy snake around (5, 7) area\n5. Consider the upper cluster at (5, 8), (6, 8) after clearing the right side\n\nLEFT",

Move LEFT to (6, 2) - collect apple (score: 6)\n2. Next turn: Move UP to (6, 3) - continue clearing this area\n3. Then work toward (7, 4) apple\n4.

Once collected, assess whether to pursue (7, 9) or adjust based on enemy snake position. Maintain my 3-apple lead by securing additional apples. The enemy is slower in apple collection, so focusing on the nearest apples and maintaining safe positions should ensure victory.\n\nUP",

LEFT goes toward enemy, RIGHT goes toward the edge but away from targets.\n\nBetween the two remaining safe moves, RIGHT is better because:\n- It maintains distance from enemy snake\n- It opens up more board space to the right\n- It allows me to eventually pursue the (9, 4) apple if needed\n- It keeps future options open\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nSince the direct UP path is blocked by enemy snake body at (4, 5), I need to navigate around. Moving RIGHT gives me flexibility to either go around the enemy snake's formation or pursue the (9, 4) apple.

Moving down to (5, 3) keeps me alive and away from the enemy formation.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nThe enemy snake is very long and blocking vertical access to the upper apples. I'm currently lead by 2 apples, so my priority is staying alive. Moving DOWN gives me space. The enemy snake should move soon, potentially opening new paths. I need to navigate around their formation and look for opportunities to reach apples at (9, 4), (7, 1), or eventually the upper apples if the enemy clears out. Avoid aggressive moves that could lead to head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy snake is far on the left, no collision risk.\n\n- **DOWN (6,3)\u2192(6,2):** Moves toward (7, 1) apple. However, moving down constrains my options since my body extends left and up.\n\n- **UP (6,3)\u2192(6,4):** Moves toward (4, 6) or (4, 8). This opens more options and lets me explore multiple apple targets.\n\nThe RIGHT move seems most direct toward the (9, 4) apple, which is reachable and positions me well on the right side where I have room to maneuver. However, UP gives me more flexibility and access to the (4, 6) apple which is closer overall.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: (9, 4) is 3 cells away (need to go +1 up, +2 right). The (7, 1) apple is also accessible. Let me continue the RIGHT strategy I started last turn - it's working toward a clear goal.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Continue moving RIGHT toward (9, 4) apple\n- Once at x=9, adjust y-coordinate to reach y=4\n- This keeps me on the right side away from the enemy snake\n- After securing (9, 4), pivot to collect remaining apples strategically\n\nRIGHT",

Moving UP keeps me in the upper region but limits flexibility.\n\nLEFT is the better strategic choice because:\n1. It moves me toward the cluster of apples at (7, 6), (7, 9), and (7, 1)\n2. It keeps options open for multiple directions\n3. The enemy at (3, 8) is not an immediate threat\n4. I can adjust course based on the next board state\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n- LEFT to (8, 4) this turn\n- Next turn, evaluate path to (7, 6) or (7, 1) depending on safety\n- Maintain distance from enemy snake #1\n- Continue collecting apples to build a larger lead\n\nLEFT",
