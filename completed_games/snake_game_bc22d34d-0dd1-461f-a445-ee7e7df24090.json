But since I'm already committed to the direction I chose, which is DOWN, I'll just roll with it for now.\n\nHmm, moving down might actually work out in my favor. If I can get closer to the enemy snake without him noticing me, I might be able to lure him towards the wall and gain an advantage. I'll keep an eye on him and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nFor the next turn, my strategy will be to continue moving in the same direction as I am now (DOWN) and observe the enemy snake's movement. If I get the opportunity to grab the apple at (9,3), I'll take it. If not, I'll try to stay close to the wall and wait for a chance to strike.\n\nSince I'm already moving down, my next move is...
