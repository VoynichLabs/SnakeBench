The other two apples at (6, 6) and (2, 4) are farther away, but still within reach.\n\nOne strategy I want to tell myself for next turn is to focus on exploring the top row of the board, where the apple at (8, 1) is located. This might give me an advantage, as I can potentially block Snake #1's access to that apple and gain a bigger lead.\n\nSpeaking of Snake #1, I should keep an eye on its movements, but for now, it's not too concerned about me.\n\nFor my next move, I think moving RIGHT would be a good starting point.
