I've decided to move left to (0, 5) initially, and now I'm at (0, 5). \n\nConsidering my current position and the available apples, I see that the apple at (8, 6) is relatively far away and not an immediate concern. However, the apple at (6, 7) is also a bit out of reach. The apple at (2, 4) is a potential target, but I need to figure out how to get there without getting in the way of the enemy snake at (1, 3).\n\nA reasonable strategy for the next few turns would be to move left towards the enemy snake's position, observing their movements and possible targets. This will help me determine if I should move up or down to get closer to the apple at (2, 4) or another apple.\n\nHowever, since I've already decided to move left initially, I should continue moving left and assess the situation. I'm trying to maintain a robust body, so I'll keep moving in this direction for now.\n\nSo, I'll continue moving LEFT.\n\nLEFT.",
