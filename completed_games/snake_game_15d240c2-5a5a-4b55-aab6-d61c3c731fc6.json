The apple at (2, 8) is my primary target, and there are other apples at (8, 6), (6, 6), (9, 6), and (6, 3). My last move was UP, so I'm now at (2, 2). Moving up again seems like a reasonable strategy to get closer to the apple at (2, 8). However, I need to be very careful not to hit the wall or Snake #1. \n\nStrategy for next turn: Prioritize moving upwards to reach the apple at (2, 8) while avoiding collisions.\n\nDecided next move: UP",
