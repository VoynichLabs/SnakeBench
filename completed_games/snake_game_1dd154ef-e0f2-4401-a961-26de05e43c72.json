My current position is at (7,6) with the body at [], and my last move information shows that I moved right to (7,6), but didn't move anywhere.\n\nI have apples within my reach at (6,9), (1,4), (7,8), (9,0), and (5,8). The last move information was to the right, so I'm currently at (7,6).\n\nSince I'm already at the right edge of the board, moving right would not increase my x-coordinate. Moving left to (5,6) would put me near the apple at (5,8), but I risk colliding with Snake #1 at (5,8), which would result in having to go backwards (in this game, it's not explicitly stated what happens when colliding, but it's common to just reset the snake to its previous position). Therefore, I will set my minds to clarify how to keep from colliding in the future.\n\nIf I move up to (6,7), I'll be out of the way of the colliding possibilities with Snake #1 and have more options to reach other apples like (1,4).\n\nBy coming down to (6,5), I'll be out of reach of the apple at (5,8) and also less likely to collide with Snake #1. \n\nAiming for the apple at (1,4) seems less compelling given the potential risks with Snake #1.\n\nI'll aim for the apple at (6,9), which is higher up and further away from Snake #1.\n\nNext move will be to move UP to (6,7).\n\nStrategy for next turn: The aim will be to secure the middle ground between Apple (6,9) and (1,4) with a slight chance to reach (5,8) if I need to.",

On the other hand, I could move up to (6,6) and then move down to (6,9), but that would mean I'm moving down first, which would decrease my y-coordinate.\n\nConsidering my goal is to secure the middle ground between Apple (6,9) and (1,4), I think it would be wise to prioritize reaching the apple at (6,9) while minimizing the risk of collision with Snake #1. Aiming for the apple at (6,9) would also give me a chance to grow and gain points.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Focus on reaching the apple at (6,9) while being mindful of my surroundings and avoiding potential collisions.\n\nNext move: UP to (6,8).",
